WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
there with me, please, to Psalm 122. Not my message, but I'm glad to see you all here

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.720
tonight. Amen. Here we are on a Tuesday night. It's the third day of the revival meetings

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.260
and I'm thankful that you're here tonight. I praise the Lord for that. Thank you for

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.440
coming and being faithful to the house of God and supporting your fall revival meeting.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.639
Psalm 122, it's another one of David's song of degrees. It's a Davidic psalm, certainly

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:29.079
put the music, and this is a particular psalm that I love, the first verse there. It says

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.919
David says, I was glad. See that? He said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.360
go into the house of the Lord. Now I'll tell you, there's a, there's a message all of its

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.240
own right there. That'll preach real good. David said, I was glad. That word glad, there's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.159
a very interesting word. In the Hebrew it's tzolmach and it means this. It means to be

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.259
merry, to exult, to be gleesome, to be cheerful, to be joyful, to be excited. Amen. It means

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:02.799
to come to the house of God with great expectation. When we come to church, we should come to

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.800
church expecting God to do something. And you know, God wants to show up in a meeting.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.279
That's why we have prayer before the service. That's why we want to make sure we commit

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:19.040
and consecrate everything unto the Lord because we want the Lord to show up. We want the Lord

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.519
to do something. I remember years ago, evangelist Harold Vaughn said, it's good to be in town

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:31.059
when God shows up. And there's a lot of truth to that. And I'm glad that we've seen meetings

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:35.059
over the years where God has certainly showed up. And I'll tell you, it was a hallelujah

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:39.620
time and we thank the Lord for that. But David said, listen, I was glad when they said unto

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.980
me, let us go into the house of the Lord. So it's good for us to be here tonight. I've

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.900
already enjoyed the fellowship. We stood at the back door and we greeted people as they

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:53.879
came in and we've talked a little bit this evening and we've spent some time together

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.139
and just in fellowship. And I've enjoyed that. I don't know what I'd do without the fellowship

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.599
of God's people. I just say to my wife, I said, I sure am glad that I have you because

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:09.479
as we travel, us being together is a blessing because otherwise you get pretty lonely. And

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.880
so I'm glad that we have that companionship, that fellowship and that partnership in ministry.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.000
My family is many miles away from us. They're all up in Alaska and all my daughters up there

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.720
and my son-in-law who pastors a church in Sterling, Alaska is up there. And then our

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.119
five grandchildren and our 14 great-grandchildren. And so we only get to see them maybe once

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:39.240
a year, maybe twice. And every once in a while they'll come down to California. They're smart.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.639
Amen. They get out of there in the winter and either come to California or go to Hawaii.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.119
Wowee, mawee. And so we don't get to go up there that much. And so we miss our family

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:57.000
and we don't have any family left in California. So it's just us and us too. And so I'm thankful

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.639
for the fellowship of my wife, but what a blessing family is. What a joy it is to be

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:07.240
able to fellowship with your family, but your family too. We're all part of the family of God.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:13.720
And so we can gather together in this place and we can enjoy the fellowship one with another.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.960
I've said this many times, I've been in 36 countries in the world in my lifetime.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.679
And you can't go anywhere where you don't, you find brothers and sisters everywhere you go.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.440
You find believers everywhere you go. It's amazing to me, you can find believers in some

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.199
of the most bizarre places. And it's a joy and it's a blessing to know that we have brothers

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.679
and sisters in Christ around the world that we can fellowship with. I found them in some pretty

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:44.119
interesting places. And so praise the Lord for that. Amen. The fellowship of the saints is a joy

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:49.479
and it's a blessing. So I'm glad that we're here tonight. I think we should be glad we are able to

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.360
come here tonight. I'm thankful for the liberty, the freedom we have in America to gather together

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.279
in this place and to have fellowship one with another. A lot of gallant men paid for our liberty

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.759
and our freedom with their blood on the battlefields of wars that have been fought

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:09.160
in this country to keep us free. And so we ought to thank God for that. We're a free people.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.360
Now there's a lot of things going on in America today that people are getting concerned about.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.119
They wonder how much longer we're going to have our freedom. Well, listen, we have freedom. We

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:22.359
are a free country. And as long as we have it, we ought to praise God for it. It's a precious thing.

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:27.640
It's a precious thing. Amen. If you've ever talked to anybody who came from a communist

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.600
country, you'll know when they come here, they realize what a joy it is to live in the United

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.160
States of America. I'm getting a little bit tired of people complaining about this country.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.399
And by the way, we don't have to make excuses to anybody. We don't need to, listen, friends,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.399
we don't need to ask the forgiveness of anybody. We've done so much for the world and we've been

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:54.839
so gracious to the world and we've shared our abundance with the world. So we have no apologies

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.760
to make. Would you agree with that? It's a wonderful thing to be an American. I thank God

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.200
that I was born here. And we have our brother and sister down here that came from countries down in

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.079
Central America and praise the Lord for them. And now they're here in our great country and

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:12.679
they're Americans. Praise the Lord. We're with a bunch of Filipino people in our home church,

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:17.239
and they're all Americans now, and they rejoice in that. And they all, hey, listen, let me tell

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.040
you what, on Veterans Day, all of our Filipino brethren are in their uniforms because 90%

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.839
of our men are retired from the United States Navy. So we praise the Lord for that. Amen.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.880
We've got freedom and we have freedom that we ought to rejoice in. All right,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.239
2 Timothy chapter four in your Bible tonight, that was free by the way, I just thought I'd

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:38.519
share that. 2 Timothy chapter four in verse seven, if you didn't already get it, I have a patriot,

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:43.799
I love my country. 2 Timothy chapter four in verse seven. We're going to start there tonight and

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:48.920
we're going to move over to the Old Testament in a minute. But 2 Timothy chapter four in verse

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.480
seven, I shared this verse along with one over in Acts chapter 20. Maybe we'll look at that just

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.920
in a minute as well, on Saturday with the men's prayer breakfast. But I want you to look at 2

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.160
Timothy four in verse seven. If you will, if you can, please let's stand out of respect for the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.040
reverence and for the respect and reverence for the reading of God's word tonight. 2 Timothy

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.760
chapter four in verse seven. I'll read the one verse silently, then you can just follow along

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.320
silently, then we'll pray and get into the message God has for us tonight. Now the Apostle Paul

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.559
speaking here and says this, he said, I fought a good fight. He said, by the way, I've finished my

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:32.920
course and also I've kept the faith. But I want you to look at that word, the operative word there

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:41.239
in that particular verse of scripture is finished. Paul finished. And I believe he finished a lot

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:47.559
stronger than the way he started, but he finished. He never deviated from his course. He never

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:51.559
changed course. Now, perhaps along the way, he had to make some course corrections. And then I

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.959
suggest to you tonight that when we start talking about revival, revival really is a course

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:01.559
correction for many people that maybe have gotten off course and gotten going in the wrong direction

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.279
and not been heading in a direction that God has established for them in their Christian life.

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.679
And they need a course correction and they've gotten back on course. The Spirit of God has

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:14.920
nudged them back on the course again. Now, I don't know about you, but I want to finish strong.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.679
I don't want to, listen, friends, I don't want to finish weak. I want to finish strong.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.839
When my time comes to close my eyes in death and go be with the Lord Jesus, I want to be able to

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:32.519
say, I finished my course. That should be the desire of every Christian. We should want to

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:37.880
finish our course and we should want to finish it well. And I think that's an important thing.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.320
It's a biblical imperative that we do so. Too many people are reversing course or getting

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.920
off course and going in the wrong direction. And we see a lot of that going on today. There's a

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.559
lot of apostasy going on today in the world, not just in America. And so we want to be good

00:07:55.559 --> 00:08:00.040
course keepers. We're going to talk about that tonight by God's grace for just the next few

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.880
minutes. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the reading of that word tonight. We ask God you'd

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.720
meet with us now and that you would help us. Help me. I'm a needy preacher. I'm going to need

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.160
your help. If I'm going to preach this message tonight, the way you've impressed it upon my

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.239
heart. Spirit of God, do that which only you can do. And Lord, use me tonight as a vessel unto

00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:22.359
honor. God, use me tonight to be your vessel. Lord, speak through me as your conduit. Lord,

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:26.519
I pray that you'd fill me with thy spirit and wipe my lips. God, help me not to say anything

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.440
tonight, but what it would bring praise and glory and honor to your name. We'll thank you for it

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.479
now in Jesus' name and for his sake. And to this I do say, amen and amen. Thank you. May be seated.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.679
A couple of years ago, I began thinking about the big differences that

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:47.719
little things make. Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever thought about the big

00:08:47.719 --> 00:08:53.960
differences that little things make? And I could probably give you a long list of all the

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.679
little things that we allow into our lives that end up being, making big differences. I mean,

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:04.599
it's amazing to me how big a list we could possibly come up with. And like I said, if I

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:08.520
really want to finish my course strong for the Lord Jesus Christ, I want to make sure that I

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.799
stay on track, to stay on course. I want to read this to you very quickly as I get into my message.

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:19.479
I happened to see this not too awful long ago and I pieced this together and I wrote it down so I

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:25.320
wouldn't forget it. And so I want to read this to you. In precision aeronautical navigation,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.080
coursekeeping and maintaining the proper heading is critical if one expects to arrive at their

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:39.719
desired destination. Truly direction determines destination. Consider that if an aviator deviates

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:45.159
just one degree from the correct heading, he or she can miss the arrival airport by a considerable

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:52.280
distance. It is therefore vitally important that one stay exactly on course at all times.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:55.400
Whether in nautical or aeronautical navigation,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.719
one must stay the course without deviation if one is to arrive at his or her

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:01.639
exact destination.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:04.039
Course keeping is vitally important and essential

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:06.319
in all types of navigation.

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:08.539
Getting off course by as little as one degree

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:11.079
in long range navigation can mean missing the mark

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.959
by hundreds of miles.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:16.399
It is theorized that this is exactly what happened

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.399
to Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan as they attempted

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:23.199
to circumnavigate the world in the late 1930s.

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:25.559
It is thought that faulty navigation placed them

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.759
75 miles or more from Howland Island

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:30.279
where they were to land for refueling.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.559
Running out of fuel, they may have simply crashed

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:36.239
into the sea, which is what I personally believe they did.

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:40.119
But in precision navigation, there can be absolutely

00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:43.299
no deviation from the prescribed course.

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:46.019
Many a ship has been run aground or been broken up

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:48.319
upon shoals and reefs when navigational charts

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:50.519
were not followed precisely.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:54.039
By way of illustration, if off course by one degree

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.319
after one foot of travel, the target would be missed

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:57.679
by .2 inches.

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:01.599
After 100 yards of travel, the target would be missed

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.179
by 5.2 feet.

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:07.119
After one mile of travel, the target would be missed

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:09.039
by 92.2 feet.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.279
If flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles,

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:14.719
the target would be missed by six miles.

00:11:15.599 --> 00:11:18.179
Flying from San Francisco to Washington, D.C.,

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:21.359
the target would be missed by 42.6 miles,

00:11:21.359 --> 00:11:23.999
placing the aircraft on the other side of Baltimore.

00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:28.679
If flying around the globe from Washington, D.C. and back,

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.399
the target would be missed by 435 miles,

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.659
ending up in Boston.

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:37.319
If traveling to the moon, as did the astronauts,

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:39.759
flying the Apollo missions, and you were off course

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:43.199
by only one degree, the target destination would be missed

00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:45.719
by 4,169 miles.

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:49.079
If one were able to fly to the nearest star

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.759
and there was a mere one degree course deviation,

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:55.719
the target would be missed by 441 billion miles.

00:11:56.859 --> 00:11:59.799
One degree can make a phenomenal difference.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:04.799
Yes, direction does indeed determine destination.

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:08.479
That's pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:12.299
All you have to do is get off course by one degree,

00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:14.199
one degree of deviation from course,

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:17.379
and it can end you up in the wrong place.

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:20.639
You can end up at the wrong destination.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.779
It can get you in an awful lot of trouble.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:26.399
When I was taking flying lessons several years ago,

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.559
my flight instructor kept telling me all the time,

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:31.119
keep course, man, keep course.

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:33.159
Pay attention to your course.

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.399
Don't be deviating from course.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:37.679
You do your cross countries, you better stay on course,

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:40.119
because it's a three-leg cross country.

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:43.599
And you're all by yourself, and you better be sure

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:44.919
that you properly navigate it.

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.439
That course that's been set before you,

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:48.779
you're getting up in the wrong place.

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:53.059
So deviation from the course in navigation

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:54.659
is a dangerous thing.

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:57.379
Just one degree can place you off course,

00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:59.579
and you'd not arrive at your destination

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:00.899
as you're supposed to arrive to.

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:03.139
Now, that's an amazing thing.

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:04.819
But let me apply that to your Christian life

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:06.619
and my Christian life.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.539
If you get off course by just the slightest little bit,

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.899
you're gonna end up in trouble.

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:14.259
You're gonna end up in the wrong place.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.359
You're gonna end up doing the wrong thing.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:18.959
Amen?

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.599
You're gonna end up displeasing God, by the way,

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:23.299
and we certainly don't wanna do that.

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:26.399
And any time we find ourselves drifting off course,

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.079
the most important thing for us to do

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:32.999
is to engage in a course reset.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:34.919
We need to get back on course again.

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:38.999
Course correction is extremely important.

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:40.599
Over in Acts chapter 20,

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:42.939
and no need to go there in verse 24,

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:45.119
Paul said this, that his greatest desire

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:48.079
was that he might finish his course with joy.

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:50.399
And the ministry which I've received of the Lord Jesus

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:53.199
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.679
He said, I wanna make sure that throughout

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:57.019
my entire ministry that I stay on course.

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:58.399
I don't wanna deviate from the course

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.199
that God has set for me,

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:02.679
so that I can finish my course with joy.

00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:05.559
And it's not a very joyful thing

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:06.839
when you get yourself off course

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:08.999
and find yourself at the wrong destination.

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:13.239
Sin many times take you farther than you wanna go

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.559
and take you in places where you shouldn't be.

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:19.359
And it can cause you a heartache

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.279
that you just never thought you'd ever experience

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:22.879
in your life.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:25.399
So for you and I, I think it's an important principle,

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.919
a very simple thing, but a mere one degree of difference

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.359
can cause us to have some pretty serious problems.

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:33.359
That's why God has given us

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.559
a navigation chart right here, amen?

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:38.059
It's better than any section chart I've ever seen.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.439
Section charts, sometimes they make mistakes

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:44.279
in putting together these Jepson section charts,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:45.599
but I'm gonna tell you what,

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:47.399
this is the best section chart in the world, man.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:49.639
If you just follow this section chart right here,

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.719
just follow this right here, you'll never get off course.

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:55.239
This is why God has given us this word

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:56.559
as God's instruction manual,

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.999
it's God's owner manual for you and me.

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.639
Listen, I don't belong to myself.

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.959
When I got saved, I no longer belong to me.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:05.839
I'm bought with a price, I belong to the Savior.

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.399
And he's my navigator.

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:10.559
God ought to be your navigator.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:13.079
You ever seen people, the bumper stickers on their car

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.199
said God is my pilot and I'm the co-pilot?

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:18.599
No, no, listen, he's the navigator.

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:21.159
He's the one that navigates us to make sure that we,

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.359
if we would stay on track and stay on course,

00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:24.999
we're gonna end up at the right destination.

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:25.819
Now, praise the Lord,

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:27.299
when you get saved by the grace of God,

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:30.159
you're going to end up in the right destination.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.559
You're gonna end up in heaven, amen?

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.719
If you're saved by the grace of God, you're heaven bound.

00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:37.239
But when it comes to the Christian life,

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:39.399
we ought to realize we can end up

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:40.519
heading in the wrong direction

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.799
and finish up our lives in a way

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:44.079
which is displeasing to the Lord.

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:44.959
And I don't know about you,

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.279
but when I stand before the Lord Jesus one day

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.639
and I have to give an answer

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.199
for that which has been done in my body,

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.519
that which has been done in the flesh,

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:52.719
whether it be good or bad,

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:53.559
I want to be able to say,

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:55.359
Lord, I did my best to keep course.

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.559
And when I got off course,

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.399
I tried to make course correction every time I could

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:01.119
and I consulted, I consulted the owner's manual

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:03.279
to make sure that I got back on course properly.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.959
We need to stay on course.

00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:08.939
Get off course by one degree and you've got problems.

00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:10.559
Amen?

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:12.119
First Kings chapter 11.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.999
First Kings chapter 11.

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:16.879
There's nothing really profound about this.

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:19.319
It's just really, to me, it's just very, very practical

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:21.759
when you stop and think about getting off course.

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:27.699
First Kings chapter 11, a familiar passage of scripture,

00:16:27.699 --> 00:16:29.479
but every time I read through this,

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:31.379
I see here's a brother got off course.

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:35.059
I mean, Solomon got way off course.

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:38.319
Now, it's an interesting thing

00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:39.719
when you look at Solomon's life.

00:16:39.719 --> 00:16:40.759
Remember what Solomon did?

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:41.919
If you look back in chapter three,

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.159
which we will go back there a little bit later on.

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:46.239
If you go back to chapter three,

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:48.319
you can see that Solomon asked God for what?

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:49.599
He asked him for wisdom.

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.759
Now, God would have given him anything that he asked for,

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.439
but he asked for wisdom.

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:56.199
He said, now, I'm just like a little child.

00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:58.479
I don't know how to lead this life so great a people.

00:16:58.479 --> 00:17:00.399
And Lord, if I'm going to do this,

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:03.639
if I'm going to lead these people, as did David, my father,

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:04.999
I'm going to have to have wisdom.

00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:07.199
And God, I need your wisdom.

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:09.279
And I think that really pleased the Lord.

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:11.439
That he asked that of himself

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.559
rather than asked for riches and wealth

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.399
and all the things that a king would,

00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:18.519
you would think that a king would be entitled to.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:21.119
By the way, later on in life, God gave him that too.

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:25.299
God gave him wealth and God provided him with things

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:27.039
that were just absolutely marvelous things,

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:27.879
wonderful things.

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:29.659
I mean, he had amazing wealth.

00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:30.719
They say that he may well have been

00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:32.819
one of the wealthiest men that ever lived.

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:38.739
But somewhere along the line, Solomon got off course.

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:40.739
You know, look at this very quickly.

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:44.179
Look at 1 Kings chapter 11,

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:45.739
and I'm going to read down through this pretty quickly,

00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:47.019
so stick with me.

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.299
By the way, let me do this.

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.219
Let's go over, if you look over,

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:51.459
we don't need to read the whole chapter.

00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:53.539
If you look at 1 Kings chapter 10,

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.819
we know the queen of Sheba came to visit him

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.819
because she said, I've heard about your kingdom.

00:17:57.819 --> 00:17:58.859
I've heard about your wealth.

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:00.139
I've heard about all that you have.

00:18:00.139 --> 00:18:02.499
I've heard about everything associated with your kingdom.

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:05.619
She came to see for herself if it was true.

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:08.179
You remember she came, and what did Solomon do?

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:09.699
Well, he trotted out all of his wealth.

00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:11.179
He trotted out all the things that he had,

00:18:11.179 --> 00:18:12.539
everything that God gave to him.

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:13.519
He trotted all that out.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:16.419
I think some pride was involved in that.

00:18:16.419 --> 00:18:18.779
You can see, as you go down through chapter 10,

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:20.259
you can see how she saw this,

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:22.779
and she was amazed by what she saw.

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:25.679
I would have been amazed, and so would have you been,

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:29.019
to have been able to see all that God had blessed him with.

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:30.739
And by the way, God blessed him with it.

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:32.379
Hey, friends, let me tell you this.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:34.239
We don't get wealth at our own hand.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.299
Any wealth that we have comes from the hand of God.

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:39.539
And God told the children of Israel that.

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:41.699
He said, don't you think that you earned your own wealth,

00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:42.539
and it came from you?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.459
It came from me.

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:47.259
And anytime you get to thinking that it came from you,

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.759
you know, these self-made men, they say,

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:49.939
well, I'm a self-made man,

00:18:49.939 --> 00:18:51.259
and nobody ever gave me anything.

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:52.679
Everything I have, I earned myself.

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:54.739
Let me tell you what, that is, as far as I'm concerned,

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:56.179
that's an arrogant statement.

00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:00.419
Because even what the heathen has, God gave to him.

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:02.979
He didn't get that on his own.

00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:05.939
And so I thank God for that.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.099
God has blessed me.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:11.299
I don't know how he's, I'm sure he's blessed you as well.

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:13.179
But he sees it, but she saw all this.

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:18.019
But look in 1 Kings 10, verse 24.

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:20.259
After he trots out all this wealth that he has,

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.699
and she sees all this, and it says,

00:19:21.699 --> 00:19:22.979
all the earth sought the psalm,

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:26.219
and to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:28.059
And they brought every man as present,

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:30.259
vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments,

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:32.939
and armor and spices and horses and mules,

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:33.899
arrayed year by year.

00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:36.500
So people are just bringing all this wealth to him.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.939
That's amazing.

00:19:37.939 --> 00:19:40.859
Verse 20, and Solomon gathered together chariots

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:45.699
and horsemen, and he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen,

00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.819
whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:49.819
with the king of Jerusalem.

00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:52.500
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.979
as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees

00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:59.259
that are in the veil for abundance.

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.099
And Solomon.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:03.399
had horses brought out of Egypt in linen yarn, and king's

00:20:03.439 --> 00:20:06.999
merchants received a linen yarn at a price. And a chariot

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.839
came up and went out of Egypt, and six hundred shekels of

00:20:09.879 --> 00:20:12.239
silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so all

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:15.379
the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:18.819
they bring him out by their means." All right, now I'm

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:21.079
going to jump into chapter 11. We may come back and look at

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:25.899
this again. But, now I want you to see that word, but.

00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:29.859
Anytime I see that word, but, in the Bible I say, well here

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:36.259
it comes, but. I look this word up, it appears many times

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.159
in the Bible. You see it throughout the Word of God,

00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:44.199
this word, B-U-T, but. But, but, but, King Solomon, look

00:20:44.239 --> 00:20:50.739
at this, loved many strange women. Now that word, stranger,

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:52.879
is an interesting word. If you look it up in the Hebrew it

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.879
means alien, it means heathen, it means pagan, also it means

00:20:56.899 --> 00:21:02.279
harlot, it could mean harlot as well. So, he loved many

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:06.279
strange women. These were women who were pagan women, they

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:08.279
were heathen women, they weren't godly women, they

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:11.519
weren't Jews, these were women from alien countries, from

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:15.519
other nations. And so notice it says, and King Solomon loved.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:18.559
Now the word love there is Ahab, or Ahab, and it's the

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:21.739
same basic word as Eros in the New Testament, it's a sexual

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:25.899
affection, or it's lust is what it is. So the love that he had

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:30.759
for these women wasn't agape love, it was lust. So he lusted

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:35.559
after these women. So he had a real woman problem. And he

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.599
wasn't the only one in the Old Testament that had a woman

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:41.479
problem. So, King Solomon loved many, he didn't say just a

00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:45.039
few, it says many strange women. Look at this, watch now,

00:21:45.079 --> 00:21:47.239
I want you to note this, we're going to go back and look at

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:50.239
this, many strange women together with the daughter of

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:53.879
Pharaoh. Oh, now you've got to mark that because we're going

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:56.799
to go back and take a look at that in a few minutes. Along

00:21:56.839 --> 00:22:00.779
with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, the

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.139
Ammonites, the Edomites, the Zidonians, and the Hittites.

00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:08.579
Watch now, of the nations concerning which the Lord said

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:13.759
unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in unto them,

00:22:13.779 --> 00:22:18.019
neither shall they come unto you, for surely they will turn

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:20.859
away your heart. And of course we see in Exodus 34, 16 what

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:24.279
God has to say about that. God said, listen you don't want to

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:27.919
be marrying these pagan women, these heathen women from these

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:31.559
alien countries because what they're going to do when you

00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:33.759
get involved with these women is, is they're going to turn

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:38.459
your heart away from the God of Heaven. So don't do it, He

00:22:38.499 --> 00:22:43.199
said, don't do it. God said, don't do it. Now you can see

00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:47.339
He's going off course, can you not? Now let me say this,

00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:52.159
going off course has its consequences. It has serious

00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:57.099
consequences. Every sin that you and I commit, every

00:22:57.139 --> 00:23:00.599
deviation from the Word of God, every time we get off

00:23:00.639 --> 00:23:03.239
course, I guarantee you there are going to be

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:10.379
consequences. Let me tell you Solomon is going to experience

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:17.219
some consequences. So verse 2 again, and let me, I want to

00:23:17.239 --> 00:23:18.999
go back to verse 1, I want to read the two together,

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:22.339
But King Solomon loved many strange women, together with

00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:24.839
the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,

00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:27.779
Idonians, Edomites, Idonians, and Hittites, of the nations

00:23:27.819 --> 00:23:30.619
concerning which the Lord sent unto the children of Israel.

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:33.619
Ye shall not go into them, neither shall they come in

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:38.019
unto you. For surely they will turn away your heart after

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:41.759
their gods, little g, but Solomon claimed unto these in

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:45.539
love. So in other words he claimed unto them as a result

00:23:45.619 --> 00:23:50.319
of his lust, the lust of his flesh, the lust of his flesh.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:55.699
But I tell you what that's a dangerous thing. Amen. I've

00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:58.499
told my wife I don't know how many times when we've been

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.739
counseling with people, especially with folks with

00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:04.939
marital problems and perhaps there is infidelity going on.

00:24:04.979 --> 00:24:08.379
And maybe there is, we've got young men that maybe have

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:11.379
gotten themselves involved with an ungodly young woman, or

00:24:11.419 --> 00:24:13.819
vice versa. And I've said, listen, I've said to my wife

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:16.639
many times, boy this thing of the female flesh is a

00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:21.879
powerful thing. It's a powerful thing. I wrote this down in

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:24.179
my Bible so I wouldn't forget it. For me I wrote it down.

00:24:24.219 --> 00:24:27.419
Satan will exploit a man's weaknesses and employ devices

00:24:27.459 --> 00:24:30.319
to turn his heart from God. And he'll do it every time he

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:35.559
gets an opportunity. So Satan has devised a multitude of

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.059
evils to turn the hearts of God's people away from him. He

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:43.099
wants to get you off course. The devil wants to get you off

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:46.319
course. And that's exactly what was happening with

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:49.919
Solomon here. Verse 4, For it came to pass, when Solomon

00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:54.299
was old, that his wives, well let me go back, I missed verse

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:57.699
3. And he had seven, now if I had missed this we'd have been

00:24:57.739 --> 00:25:01.199
in trouble. And he had 700 wives, princesses, and 300

00:25:01.239 --> 00:25:05.039
concubines, and his wives turned away his heart. And this

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:09.419
brother, what was this brother thinking? This guy's got 1,000

00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:16.179
women. What is he thinking? I'll tell you what, he had to

00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:19.679
just, he had to be out of his mind. He's got himself 1,000

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:22.519
wives. Someone said, well he had a lot of trophy wives. Well, I

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:26.919
guess so. But he had 1,000 wives. That's a lot of

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:30.059
hosiery over the shower curtain, amen? I'm telling you

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:33.559
man, 1,000 wives. Hey, listen you've got more than one woman

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.399
in the house. You've got two women in the kitchen, you've

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:41.719
got a problem. I happened to be watching, we were in a hotel

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:44.959
and I turned the TV on, sometimes you wish you didn't

00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:47.859
do that. But I turned the TV on and I got this thing on there

00:25:47.899 --> 00:25:49.699
called, Sister Wives. I don't know if you've ever seen that.

00:25:49.739 --> 00:25:52.799
But it's this guy, it's supposed to be a Reformed

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:56.839
Mormon that's practicing polygamy, because he said

00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:00.319
Joseph Smith said it's ok. So, he's practicing polygamy and

00:26:00.339 --> 00:26:02.719
he's got I think seven or eight wives, or whatever it is. And

00:26:02.739 --> 00:26:04.879
they try to get on there and tell you that, oh, we never

00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:07.159
have any issues with each other. We are not jealous of

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:09.399
one another. We all get along with each other. Well, they're

00:26:09.439 --> 00:26:15.399
all lying. Amen. I've got an amen out of this crowd. Praise

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:18.139
the Lord, that's right brother, amen. I want to tell you

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:21.379
what, seven women in one household like that. I'm

00:26:21.419 --> 00:26:24.879
talking about wives. These women are all wives, they're

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:28.219
supposed to be wives. Well, God never prescribed that. God

00:26:28.259 --> 00:26:31.659
never authorized that. You go back to Genesis chapter 2 and

00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:34.059
it's right there, one man for one woman for one lifetime.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:38.639
God never authorized polygamy. He never did, but they did it

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:42.279
anyway in spite of what God said. And now you've got, this

00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:44.719
guy's got seven wives in one house and he's sitting there

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:47.579
smiling, these women are all fighting over him. And I look

00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:50.019
at this guy and I said, man I haven't got any idea why

00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:57.459
anybody would fight over this dude. Amen. Man, he's one ugly

00:26:57.459 --> 00:27:04.979
fellow. I mean I don't understand that. And these

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:08.039
gals are all fighting over this guy. And they say, oh, we've

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:11.039
got peace here. And I said, I don't believe that. I remember

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:14.179
my grandmother, bless her heart, she was an old Irish woman

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:17.779
and I was adopted, so I'm not Irish, I'm Scottish and French,

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:21.859
but what a combination that is. But my grandmother, my

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:25.159
mother's mother was Irish, her father was from County Cork,

00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:29.639
Ireland, and my grandmother was jealous of her kitchen. And I

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:32.239
tell you what, you better not go in her kitchen when she was

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:36.479
cooking. And the women in the family knew better than going

00:27:36.499 --> 00:27:39.739
there when she was cooking. And they would have Thanksgiving or

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:41.839
Christmas or whatever it was and she'd be in there putting

00:27:41.879 --> 00:27:44.019
the feast together, take her two or three days to do it and

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.659
get all the fixings done and everything else. And if

00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:49.979
anybody had a tendency to venture into the kitchen while

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:52.219
she's cooking she'd say, I can still hear her say, scat,

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:56.519
scat, scat, scat, get out of my kitchen, she'd say. You know,

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:58.819
and the men don't dare even go anywhere near that kitchen. I

00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:00.959
tell you that right now. You wouldn't even think about going

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:03.439
in there and stealing something to eat. And I mean, that's just

00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:07.199
the way it was. And so can you imagine having a thousand women

00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:12.679
in one household? Now, he's collecting women. Now, I

00:28:12.699 --> 00:28:16.419
collect high-end airplane models. I like airplane models,

00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:19.519
amen. I collect die-cast cars and stuff like that. I'm just

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:23.059
still got a little of the, you know, the boy left in me. So, I

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:25.819
collect that stuff, but I guarantee I'm not collecting

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:31.199
women. One woman is enough, amen. Now, I'm not saying that

00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:34.059
in a deleterious manner or in a negative manner. I thank God for

00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:37.159
my wife. She's all I need. I don't need any other women

00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:41.099
around. Praise the Lord, amen. She don't want any other women

00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:45.839
around either, I'll tell you that right now. So, he had 700

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:49.239
wives, princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives, all

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:52.279
these women, turned away his heart. For it came to pass,

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:56.739
when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart

00:28:56.779 --> 00:28:59.979
after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with the Lord,

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:04.479
his God, as was the heart of David his father. Boy, there's

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:07.179
an indictment right there. You know the Bible says that David

00:29:07.219 --> 00:29:12.099
was a man after God's own heart. Now, in 1 Kings chapter 3 the

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:14.399
Bible says that Solomon loved the Lord, but he didn't love

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:19.199
God as much as his father did. I think David loved God much

00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:22.259
more deeply, much more personally, much more

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:24.440
intimately. I don't think Solomon had that same

00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:27.799
relationship with God that his father had. I think his

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:32.399
relationship was very different. And so, now he's been

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.339
turned aside by all these women, and by all this lust and

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.019
everything else. And the basic fact is, is now he's not only

00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:43.259
just off one degree, now he's off course by a whole bunch.

00:29:44.139 --> 00:29:49.119
Now, getting back on course again is difficult. You get,

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:51.819
friends, if you and I get too far off course sometimes to get

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:54.159
that course adjustment to get us back to where we need to be

00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:59.199
can be very, very difficult, very difficult. And so, he's

00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:02.599
now, he's not just off course, he's off course by a whole

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:06.199
bunch. He's off course by a whole bunch. And so, he's not

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:09.440
just off course by a whole bunch, he's off course by a

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.440
distracted. The devil has got his foot in the door. Satan

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.980
has done his dirty, dastardly work. He's employed devices

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.480
which turned away Solomon's heart from God. And now he's

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.320
way off course. Now let me say this, there is no way that

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.000
God is pleased with him in this situation. No way.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.400
Someone said, well don't you think God winked at this? God

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.860
does not wink at sin. Well don't you think God was

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.400
exorcising His permissive will here? Listen, God doesn't

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.340
have a permissive will when it comes to sin. Sin is sin in

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.040
the sight of God and God hates sin. And we need to

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.880
recognize how much He does hate it. And so now he's way

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.080
off course and he's now had his heart turned away by

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.760
these women. Verse 5, For Solomon, now this is a sad,

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.020
sad statement here in Scripture. For Solomon went

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.060
after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and after

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.160
Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites. Now see that God

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.900
calls this false god of theirs an abomination. So

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.200
therefore it means to worship this god you had to engage in

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.880
abominable acts. Now I'm not going to describe to you what

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.840
they were because some of them are pretty terrible. But they

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.639
had to engage in abominable acts because this was an

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.279
abominable, abominable god, this false god. Now verse 6

00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:33.940
look at this, this is sad. This man whom God gave all

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.819
this wisdom to and all this wealth to, look at this in

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.560
verse 6, And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.220
went not fully after the LORD as did David his father. See

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.459
that backs up the statement I made to you a minute ago that

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:53.000
Solomon did not love God as deeply as did David. David

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.500
loved the Lord with all of his heart. Now did David sin? Did

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.500
he get off track? Did he get off course? Yes. But praise

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.400
the Lord David was known to make course corrections. I can

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.000
see it in Psalm 51 after that thing that he did with

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.600
Bathsheba and God broke him and he got right with the

00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:11.700
Lord, amen. When he confessed that sin, when he repented of

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.139
that sin, when he turned away from that sin, when he

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.940
forsook that sin God restored him again to fellowship. He

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.839
made a course correction that he knew he needed to make in

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.680
order to get back to where he needed to be. Had he not done

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.680
that, that lack of being on course would have run him

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.339
smack into a wall somewhere and he'd end up crashed and

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.540
burned. So praise the Lord for that testimony. And by the

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.240
way, the man of God said to him, it's a good thing that

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:41.479
you made that course correction because if you had not

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.779
repented of your sin and got right with God you'd have been

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.020
a dead man because he said, now that you've repented surely

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:49.800
thou shalt not die. So that tells me that God had signed

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.260
His death warrant, and he wouldn't have lived past 50.

00:32:53.979 --> 00:32:56.279
It was around the time that he did this thing with

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.119
Bathsheba. Now did it affect his life? Yes, things were

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.320
never the same again because there are consequences for

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.300
sin, and you have to live with those consequences. You've

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.100
got to live with them once you make that decision. Verse 7,

00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:14.600
Then did Solomon, this is amazing to me as well, then

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:17.800
did Solomon build in high place for Chemosh the

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.860
abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jerusalem,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.260
and for Molech. Now it's an amazing thing, Molech they

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.760
used to do child sacrifice to Molech and they would burn

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:35.699
their children in the fire. Not only that but the Moabite

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.380
God, their greatest God of all was Dagon the fish god.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.839
There were so many other gods that they worshipped, false

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.040
gods and all the rest that goes along with it that it's

00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:48.160
amazing to me that Solomon got so far off course that he was

00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:51.199
willing to worship these false gods. And by the way put not

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.300
on himself but the kingdom in jeopardy. Now hear this, if

00:33:56.339 --> 00:33:59.339
you get nothing else let's get this. Listen I said this the

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.380
other day, your choices and my choices when we decide that

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:04.839
we are going to sin against God it doesn't just affect us

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.020
it affects others. In this case it affected his home, it

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.240
affected his offspring, it affected the nation, the whole

00:34:13.279 --> 00:34:16.240
nation was affected by this and it brought consequences upon

00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:23.380
them. Bad choices. Verse 8, And likewise did he for all his

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:27.179
strange wives. He did all this for these women which burnt

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.059
incense and sacrificed unto their gods. Let me say this he

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.559
did this for these women, he wanted to please these women

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:43.580
rather than please God. Isn't that something? I don't know

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:46.679
how many times I've seen young people get hooked up with the

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.320
wrong individual, the wrong mate. I've told young people

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.820
this for years in counseling this way for years. I've said

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.700
listen don't be out getting on this Christian mingle thing

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.299
and all these websites, all these chat rooms or whatever

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:03.000
it is they do, this internet stuff and do this internet

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.140
dating thing. Don't be out shopping for a spouse. You let

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:09.640
God bring His choice in a spouse to you. And make sure you

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:12.179
marry right and make sure you marry in the Lord or don't get

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:18.519
married. I had a young woman say to me she said, what's the

00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:22.200
secret of your long marriage? You folks have been married a

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.160
long time. She was getting ready to get married. I said,

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.660
it's work. You work at it. And you determine in your heart

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.899
that once you get married you stay married. And if you don't

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:38.339
plan on staying married don't get married. Am I right? I

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:45.080
think so. So now look, verse 8, And likewise did he for all his

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:47.720
strings wise which burnt incense, and sacrificed unto

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.720
their gods. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, well do you

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.920
think? Because his heart was turned from the Lord God of

00:35:55.959 --> 00:36:00.799
Israel, which He had appeared unto him twice, and commanded

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.260
him. By the way let me tell you this, God had given Solomon

00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:07.000
more than enough revelation to know what was right. And had

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.480
commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.779
after other gods, but he kept not that which the Lord

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.220
commanded. Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:19.459
as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.720
and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.619
rend, that word rend in the Hebrew, ohabit means to tear

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.519
away or divide, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee,

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.880
and will give it to thy servant. I wish I had time to

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.660
just preach on that for a while. Notwithstanding in thy

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:37.619
days, I will not take it for David thy father's sake, but I

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.860
will rend it out of the hand of thy son. Howbeit I will not

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:44.860
rend away all the kingdoms, but will give one tribe to thy

00:36:44.899 --> 00:36:47.839
son, for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.299
sake, which I have chosen. This is all leading up to the

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:53.000
divided kingdom. And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.580
Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, and he was the king of the

00:36:56.299 --> 00:36:59.299
seed of Edom. Now I want to read something to you here very

00:36:59.339 --> 00:37:01.940
quickly, and then I'm going to look at 1 Kings chapter 3.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.839
Just listen to this, When thou art come unto the land which

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.380
the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.559
speaking to the children of Israel, and shalt dwell therein

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.119
and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.000
nations that are about me. Thou shalt in any wise set him

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:21.700
king over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall choose. One from

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:24.760
among the brethren shalt thou set king over thee, thou mayest

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.119
not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother. But

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.920
he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people

00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:35.559
to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.600
horses. Forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ye shall

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.399
henceforth return no more that way. Listen, neither shall he

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.700
multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn him not away,

00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:49.540
neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.839
gold. Do you hear that? God said, listen, neither shall the

00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:57.959
king multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.480
Oh, that's in Deuteronomy chapter 17. So, Solomon knew

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:09.040
this. Solomon couldn't cop out and say, I didn't know this,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.920
God never told me this, I didn't know this was wrong. Come

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.179
on now, he knew it was wrong. He knew it was wrong when he

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.160
started doing it. He intentionally got off course.

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:23.720
It's like flying, you're flying the heading that's assigned to

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.220
you, or whatever heading you're supposed to be flying. And all

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.220
of a sudden you just decide, nope, not flying that way

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.860
anymore, I think I'll fly this way, or I think I'll fly this

00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:36.760
way. And you get off the prescribed course, guess what?

00:38:36.799 --> 00:38:39.200
You're not going to end up at your destination, and also too

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:42.299
you're liable to have a mid-air collision, or something else

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.780
is going to happen, or you're going to fly into weather.

00:38:44.799 --> 00:38:47.340
There's all kinds of things you can do when you get off

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:52.460
course. Solomon knew what he was doing when he did it. And he

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.059
did it consciously, he did it intentionally, he did it

00:38:56.099 --> 00:39:01.599
volitionally. It breaks my heart when I think about it.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.739
Now, Solomon said, well I wouldn't do that, excuse me. Now

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.479
you might not gather yourself, sir you might not gather a

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.119
thousand wives and concubines. I don't know how you could ever

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:16.619
possibly do that in this day and age. I mean it would just,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.340
well I guess some people might try to do that. But I mean

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.140
there is no way that most of us are ever going to even think

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:24.539
about that, but there are so many other areas where we get

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:31.220
off course. Listen to this, 1 Kings chapter 3 and verse 1,

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.220
someone asked me not too long ago, well, Brother Meshon where

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.159
did he get off course? Where did it start? When did he get

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.000
one degree off course, and get it in such a horrible

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:49.820
situation? 1 Kings chapter 3, verse 1, And Solomon made

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:55.419
affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.700
daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he

00:39:59.739 --> 00:40:02.159
had made an end of building his own house, and the house of

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.200
the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. Do you

00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:08.979
see that? Before he had even asked for a

00:40:08.979 --> 00:40:17.579
wisdom from the Lord, before he even got to that step, before it ever really got started,

00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:25.139
right from the very get-go, he made affinity with Egypt. He became an ally to them, and

00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:32.599
oh, and he took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David. He violated the

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:38.299
Word of God right there. He disobeyed God right there. He disobeyed what was stated

00:40:38.299 --> 00:40:44.339
in Deuteronomy and other places of Scripture, not necessarily that text I wrote to you.

00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:48.059
They weren't supposed to marry into these foreign women and take strange wives unto

00:40:48.059 --> 00:40:54.519
themselves. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing. So that's where really

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:58.659
I think he got off course by just one degree, and he continued to go in that direction off

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:03.099
and on throughout his life, even though he had exercised great wisdom, and God blessed

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:11.259
him in so many ways, but yet in the end, what did he do? Not only did he disobey God,

00:41:11.259 --> 00:41:17.579
but he ended up his life worshiping these false gods of these women that he gathered

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:27.499
unto himself and brought into his household. Man, he was way off course. Way off course.

00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:32.099
We need to be good course keepers, friends. We need to make sure that we stay on course

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:37.419
because you get off course by just one degree, just one degree, and I guarantee you, you

00:41:37.419 --> 00:41:42.459
are going to end up at the wrong destination. You're going to end up where God doesn't want

00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:47.299
you to be. Remember what I said last night? The place to be is in the center of God's

00:41:47.299 --> 00:41:57.819
perfect will. God's perfect will. I guess what I've done now, and really it should be

00:41:57.819 --> 00:42:02.339
all of our prayer, I think, every day, my greatest desire when I lift my voice up in

00:42:02.339 --> 00:42:09.099
God's prayer is this, Lord, please help me to stay in the very center of thy perfect

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:17.539
will. I never want to get out of God's will for me and for my life. Can you imagine how

00:42:17.539 --> 00:42:30.419
it would affect not only your life and your ministry but your family? You know? You get

00:42:30.419 --> 00:42:40.539
off into the wrong stuff, man, it can affect a lot of people. One sinner can do great harm

00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:48.539
in a home, a family, a church. We need to stay on course. And there's so many of God's

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:54.699
people today that are off course, it's just egregious to me that people have gotten so

00:42:54.699 --> 00:43:02.499
far off course. What has happened to the thinking of God's people today where they've gotten

00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:06.899
themselves turned upside down and right side, they're not right side up anymore, they're

00:43:06.899 --> 00:43:12.059
upside down. They see good as evil and evil as good or they support sometimes things they

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:15.179
shouldn't support or get involved in things they ought not get involved in and they don't

00:43:15.179 --> 00:43:19.579
even think twice, how does this affect my relationship with God? How does it affect

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:24.019
my walk with God? How does it affect my prayer life? How does it affect my devotional life?

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:32.019
How does it affect my church life? How does it affect my family life? And sometimes people

00:43:32.019 --> 00:43:36.619
just don't think the way they ought to think and they don't use biblical reason, they don't

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:43.219
use the course that God has set for them in the Word of God and they exercise human logic

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:46.859
and they somehow figure out and think that I think this is alright, I don't think this

00:43:46.859 --> 00:43:51.299
is a problem. Oh, God won't mind if I do this. Remember what I said about me robbing God

00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:55.779
of tithes when I first got saved? I had exercised human logic thinking that God understands.

00:43:55.779 --> 00:44:00.819
No, God does not understand sin. When God says that we're supposed to be doing something

00:44:00.819 --> 00:44:04.099
and He says this is the course that you are to get on and keep then that's what we ought

00:44:04.099 --> 00:44:09.539
to do. And God sees anything less than that as sin. There's no gray area, it's black and

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:14.459
white. Someone said to me one time when I was in the military, I had one of my men say

00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:19.659
to me, you know what your problem is? Your problem is you're just too black and white.

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:24.019
I said, in the business we're in my friend, you better believe everything is black and

00:44:24.019 --> 00:44:28.459
white because the ordinance manual is written in blood and when we're handling explosives,

00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:33.779
I'm going to tell you what friends, there's absolutely no room for error whatsoever, ever,

00:44:33.779 --> 00:44:40.539
ever, ever. Well listen friends, we're talking about things of eternity, of eternal value.

00:44:40.539 --> 00:44:45.419
We're talking about things that are related to our walk with God and our service for God

00:44:45.419 --> 00:44:49.899
and how it affects and influences everybody else and we get so selfish and self-centered

00:44:49.899 --> 00:44:54.539
sometimes that we don't realize and understand the choices we make affect other people and

00:44:54.539 --> 00:45:02.539
we get off course by just a degree. It can lead us to all sorts of dangerous conclusions.

00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:12.139
Don't, don't, listen, don't stay off course. Get back on course. You remember that old

00:45:12.139 --> 00:45:17.019
adage my mother used to say it to me all the time, son, you need to straighten up and fly

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:33.619
right. Right? Straighten up and fly right or suffer the consequences. And you knew it was

00:45:33.619 --> 00:45:44.019
coming. Amen? And I used to tell my daughter all the time, listen, if you don't straighten up,

00:45:44.019 --> 00:45:48.579
fly right, we're going to get academic. I'm going to apply the Board of Education to the seat of

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:57.979
understanding and we'll, we'll correct the issue and the attitude. And God's, He's trying to

00:45:57.979 --> 00:46:02.459
correct us. I mean, when He sees when we get off just one degree, He tries to get us back on

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:10.059
course. You know how He does that? How can you read the Word of God and not be corrected? How

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:13.739
can you come to church like this and hear the preaching and not be corrected? I want your pastor

00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:20.099
on live stream. I know what he's preaching. Amen? You can't, there's no way you get away from it.

00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:27.819
God is providing you with everything you need to know in order to stay on course. So you don't

00:46:27.819 --> 00:46:37.819
want to straighten up and fly right. That's your problem. I got to quit. I had a guy come to me one

00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:41.899
night at my church when I was pastoring. He said, you know what, pastor, I'm just not getting fed

00:46:41.939 --> 00:46:47.859
here. I said, is that right? He goes, yeah, I'm not getting fed here. I said, well, you know what

00:46:47.859 --> 00:46:56.139
the problem is? You're just not eating. So I'm not going to spoon feed you. You should be past

00:46:56.139 --> 00:47:02.019
the pablum stage. And I said that to him graciously. I mean, as kindly as I could. But I said, brother,

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:05.939
listen, I've heard that all these years I've been in the ministry, I've heard that. That's just an

00:47:05.939 --> 00:47:12.339
excuse. The truth of matter is, is you've got all course and you don't like it when the Word of God

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:16.899
points it out to you when something gets preached you don't like. He said, the truth of matter is,

00:47:16.899 --> 00:47:23.059
I preached something today you didn't like. And you got your toe stepped on. Well, that's the

00:47:23.059 --> 00:47:29.299
grace of God. God is doing everything He can to help us stay on course. And sometimes we reject

00:47:29.299 --> 00:47:40.579
it. So you know what he did? He went someplace else to eat. And I can guarantee you he didn't

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:44.779
like what he got over there either. What do they think this is? They think there's a happy diner

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:48.859
here or something? No, we're preaching the Word of God. We're trying to help people to get on

00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:52.499
course and stay there. All right, here's my question. We're going to stand a minute. Are you

00:47:52.499 --> 00:47:57.299
on course? Or have you gotten off course? If there's any sin in your life that you're just

00:47:57.299 --> 00:48:02.219
allowing to fester and you're letting the devil draw you off course, you need to get back on

00:48:02.219 --> 00:48:08.699
course again. That's your responsibility. God says, if you will, I will. I mean, we just need

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:13.219
to make that course adjustment. Solomon would have been a whole lot better off had he done that. I

00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:22.259
don't see that he did make a major course adjustment. Certainly not the way he should

00:48:22.379 --> 00:48:30.459
have. And you can find men in the Bible that did. David was one, and there were others as well. Get

00:48:30.459 --> 00:48:34.339
on course, amen? Let's straighten up and fly right. Let's all stand tonight with our heads

00:48:34.339 --> 00:48:39.059
bowed, eyes closed. Let's stand as our sister comes to play the instrument for imitation season. I

00:48:39.059 --> 00:48:45.820
don't know how God spoke in your heart tonight, but He sure has spoken to mine. I sure want to be
