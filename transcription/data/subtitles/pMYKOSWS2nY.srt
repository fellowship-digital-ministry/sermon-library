1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,539
chapter 4, 1 John 4.

2
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:04,880
We'll be looking at v. 1-3 this morning.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,579
1 John 4.

4
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:09,140
And looking at v. 1-3.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,739
Notice with me in v. 1 of 1 John 4,

6
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,360
John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,120
says to these original recipients,

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,319
of course preserved for us this morning,

9
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:26,239
beloved, believe not every spirit,

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,799
but try the spirits,

11
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,520
whether they are of God.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,719
For as many false prophets are gone out

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,080
into the world,

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,439
hereby know ye the Spirit of God.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,880
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,240
has come in the flesh is of God,

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,400
and every spirit that confesseth not

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,319
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh

19
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,880
is not of God.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,439
And this is that spirit of Antichrist,

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,439
whereof ye have heard that it should come,

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,880
and even now already is it in the world.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Of course, the subject of false teaching

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,840
has been previously discussed several weeks ago,

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,040
actually several months ago.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,839
We looked at 1 John 2 in v. 18-27.

27
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:09,480
And as we looked at that passage of scripture

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,599
in v. 18 of 1 John 2,

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,839
the Bible says little children,

30
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,559
it is the last time.

31
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,639
And as you have heard that Antichrist shall come,

32
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:20,680
even now are there many Antichrists

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,199
whereby we know that it is the last time.

34
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,639
And John would continue through the end of the chapter,

35
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,120
really v. 27,

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,279
dealing with the subject of false teachers

37
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,800
there in the second chapter.

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
And then now again in the fourth chapter,

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,839
the subject is brought up once again.

40
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:39,739
Now we understand that our enemy is relentless.

41
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,500
We understand that not only is he relentless,

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,160
but we find that he's crafty, he's cunning.

43
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,720
And we find that his attack upon truth,

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,879
even as we studied last week,

45
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,680
is continuing to march on,

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,879
and he continues to undermine the truth

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,120
of the word of God.

48
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,680
But I am thankful that as we go to the word of God,

49
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,800
we find that God regularly reminds us

50
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,599
not only of the desire of the enemy,

51
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,480
but he also reveals to us the tactics of the enemy,

52
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,240
and then provides for us clear instruction

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,600
on how we deal with and defeat the enemy.

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,919
And we ought to rejoice in that this morning,

55
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,960
because it's not that God just told us

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,199
that they're false prophets and then false teachers

57
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,559
and then go figure it out.

58
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,720
We find that he's given us the truth

59
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,880
that these false teachers exist.

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,880
He's explained to us what their desire is

61
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,600
and what their tactics are.

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,679
And then he said, here's how you combat it.

63
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,399
Here's how you deal with it.

64
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,240
And here's how you defeat it.

65
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,919
As we look at the passage of scripture,

66
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,679
again, the revisiting of the subject matter

67
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,679
of false teaching, I've titled the message

68
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,880
from verse number one, try the spirits.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,440
And as we think about the passage of scripture

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,520
and the subject matter that is before us,

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,080
let me say this, hold your place in 1 John chapter four,

72
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,000
we're gonna look at two verses of scripture

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
because I wanna acknowledge this morning

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,839
at the very beginning of the message,

75
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,220
what is it, this question to be answered,

76
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,080
what is it that we're really seeking to avoid?

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,679
Look in the book of Ephesians, if you will,

78
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,000
the book of Ephesians in the fourth chapter,

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
what is it that we're seeking to avoid?

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,279
Why does God continue to give us truth

81
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:21,059
with regard to the false teachers that exist

82
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,860
and their tactics and so on and so forth,

83
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,460
their desires to overcome?

84
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,300
And we find that God gives us in his word

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
what it is that we're trying to avoid,

86
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,279
what are we seeking to avoid through these messages?

87
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:38,899
Notice in Ephesians four and verse number 14,

88
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,880
that we henceforth be no more children

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,559
tossed to and fro and carried about

90
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,339
with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men

91
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:55,339
and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

92
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,740
That's what we're trying to avoid.

93
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,940
We're trying to avoid this instability

94
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,759
that you read of in verse number 14

95
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,580
where they're tossed to and fro

96
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,539
with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men.

97
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,380
It says in cunning craftiness,

98
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,739
they lie in wait to deceive.

99
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,420
And when we deal with the subject matter of false teaching,

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,779
when God exposes the false teachers,

101
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,820
when he gives us instruction for how to identify

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,619
and defeat false teaching,

103
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,019
we find that what we're seeking to avoid

104
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,040
is the pitfall that is spoken of here

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,059
of this lack of stability.

106
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,160
And what is it that we're trying to avoid?

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,260
But then also, what is it that we're seeking to accomplish?

108
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,019
Turn to the book of Colossians, if you will,

109
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,899
just a few pages over in your Bible,

110
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,540
Colossians chapter number one,

111
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,760
and I want you to see what it is

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,299
that we're seeking to accomplish.

113
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,980
What is it that we wanna avoid

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,660
is this lack of stability,

115
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,579
this being tossed to and fro.

116
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,500
What is it that we're seeking to accomplish?

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,980
Well, in the book of Colossians in chapter number one

118
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,700
in verse number 23, notice what the Bible says.

119
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,700
If you continue in the faith, grounded and settled,

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,600
and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel

121
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,700
which ye have heard,

122
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,420
and which was preached to every creature

123
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,579
which is under heaven,

124
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,980
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister.

125
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,779
You see a great contrast between Ephesians 4.14

126
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,739
and Colossians 1.23.

127
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:22,420
You find that in Ephesians 4, he's saying,

128
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,579
listen, we wanna avoid this being tossed to and fro.

129
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,339
We wanna avoid this instability.

130
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,980
We wanna avoid all of this false teaching

131
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,220
and being just going back and forth

132
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,859
between what it is that we believe.

133
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,459
And in Colossians, he says,

134
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,019
we wanna be grounded and settled,

135
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,739
and move not away from the hope of the gospel.

136
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:49,179
You see that which we're seeking to avoid,

137
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:52,380
but also what it is that we're seeking to accomplish.

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,540
You know, God wants us to be grounded and settled.

139
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,660
He wants us to know who he is,

140
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,179
and he wants us to know what he has spoken.

141
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,100
And we find that he's given us the word of God,

142
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,339
and we've been given precious instruction.

143
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,540
We find that today, even as our passage would tell us

144
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,420
of these false teachers that exist,

145
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,859
and there are many false prophets

146
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,100
that are gone out into the world,

147
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,299
and we find that God gives us this instruction

148
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,859
in 1 John chapter number four.

149
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,579
If you're taking notes this morning,

150
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,980
I want you to notice, first of all,

151
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,540
the exhortation to the believers.

152
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,359
The exhortation to the believers.

153
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,899
I believe this morning, as we look at verse number one,

154
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,220
there's really a twofold exhortation that is given to us,

155
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
and this is advice or counsel

156
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,019
that God is giving to the people of God,

157
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,760
those that have been born again,

158
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,519
those that are following the Lord Jesus Christ.

159
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,959
We find that this exhortation is given.

160
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,679
Notice in verse number one,

161
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,200
the first aspect of this exhortation,

162
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,959
believe not every spirit.

163
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,820
That's pretty simple, is it not?

164
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,140
Believe not every spirit.

165
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,440
We find that the second aspect of this exhortation

166
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,160
that God is giving to the people of God

167
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
and to us this morning,

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,899
is not only that we would believe not every spirit,

169
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,980
but then notice what he says, try the spirits.

170
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,399
Try the spirits.

171
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,440
Now that word try is a very interesting word.

172
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,200
It means to test, prove, or examine.

173
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,839
The idea of the word try is to determine

174
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,760
if something is genuine or authentic.

175
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,079
That's the idea behind the Greek word that is used here

176
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,119
that's translated in our Bibles, try.

177
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,920
Try the spirits.

178
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,640
That we're to test, prove, or examine them

179
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,339
for the purpose of seeking to determine

180
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,559
if something is genuine or authentic.

181
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:51,200
And we find that God has given this exhortation.

182
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,160
He's provided this counsel,

183
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,320
this advice for the people of God.

184
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,799
And we find that as he's provided this to us,

185
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:00,200
our response to the exhortation

186
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,440
ought to be that we take heed.

187
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,359
John says, beloved, believe not every spirit,

188
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:11,000
but try the spirits, whether they are of God.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,359
We find that here this exhortation is given

190
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,359
and we are to try the spirits.

191
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,799
The word of God uses regularly

192
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,040
and in the era in which they would use

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,399
this original language,

194
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,920
we find that the word try would be used often

195
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,839
with regard to metals.

196
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,359
And they would try the metals.

197
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,359
They would seek to determine if the metals were pure,

198
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,640
if they were authentic, if they were genuine,

199
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,440
or if someone was trying to sell you a counterfeit.

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,559
That's how they would use the word.

201
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,320
Very regularly in daily business and administration,

202
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,799
they would use the same word in that manner.

203
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,479
And we find that God is telling us as the people of God

204
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:51,000
that we're to try the spirits.

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,320
We want to be able to examine.

206
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
We want to test and prove.

207
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,000
We want to determine that they're genuine,

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,679
that they're authentic.

209
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,320
We ask ourselves this question,

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
how is it that I try the spirits?

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,719
What is it that I would do?

212
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,799
How is it that I would be able to take heed

213
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,840
to this instruction that has been given?

214
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
And I find it's very interesting

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,359
as you conclude the third chapter of 1 John,

216
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,520
God gives us some great insight.

217
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
Now you understand this morning

218
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,280
that these chapter divisions

219
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,880
and the verse references were added

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
after the originals were given

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,119
for ease of being able to find and follow and read.

222
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,640
It'd be a challenging thing this morning

223
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,159
if I said just turn to the book of 1 John

224
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,719
and find where I'm reading.

225
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:36,320
And so we have these chapter divisions in these verses,

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,919
but if you look in chapter number three

227
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,320
and verse number 24,

228
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,200
and we dealt with this a couple of weeks ago,

229
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,599
it says, and he that keepeth his commandments

230
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,080
dwelleth in him and he in him.

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,000
Notice what he says,

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,080
and hereby we know that he abideth in us

233
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,960
by the spirit which he hath given us.

234
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,799
And we rejoice in the truth,

235
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,719
the reality of his abiding presence,

236
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,320
when we speak about the...

237
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,520
the Holy Spirit of God that is mentioned

238
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,060
in 1 John 3 and verse 24.

239
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,520
But when we understand the truth

240
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,140
of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God,

241
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,180
yes, He's the Comforter.

242
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,060
But He's also the Teacher.

243
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,020
He is the Divine Teacher.

244
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,280
And God in His awesome plan.

245
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,180
I mean, God is supreme.

246
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,940
He's nothing that He's not thought of.

247
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,420
Right? He's God.

248
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,020
And in His awesome plan,

249
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,420
He determined for New Testament believers

250
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,160
that at the moment of salvation,

251
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,340
the Holy Spirit of God would indwell us.

252
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,740
And as the Holy Spirit of God

253
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,020
indwells every believer today,

254
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,660
we find that yes, He is the earnest

255
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,460
of our inheritance.

256
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,420
We find the proof, if you will,

257
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,700
of our redemption is that the Holy Spirit of God

258
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,100
indwells the believer.

259
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,420
But we find that yes, He's our Comforter.

260
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,220
And we rejoice in that comfort.

261
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,220
And we often wonder as we would go through

262
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,220
the trials and difficulties of life,

263
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,700
how is it that someone that does not know

264
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,220
the God of all comfort,

265
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,340
someone that does not have the Comforter

266
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,700
that indwells them,

267
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,300
how do they deal with some of the things of life?

268
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,060
And we rejoice in having the Comforter.

269
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,060
But He's also the Teacher.

270
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,820
And He leads us into all truth.

271
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,580
And we ought to rejoice in that.

272
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,780
See, Jesus, as He's speaking to His disciples

273
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,620
in the book of John,

274
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,980
before He would go to the cross of Calvary,

275
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,020
we find that Jesus is giving them wonderful truth

276
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,320
with regard to the things that would take place

277
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,820
and the responsibilities that they would have

278
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,180
with regard to ministry.

279
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,860
And He's providing them with great instruction.

280
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,180
And He tells them about sending the Holy Spirit of God,

281
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,860
sending the Comforter.

282
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,300
And He mentions that in a few passages

283
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
in this section of the book of John.

284
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,840
But in John chapter number 16, in verse number seven,

285
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,700
He says this to the disciples,

286
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,860
"'Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

287
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,820
"'It is expedient for you that I go away.

288
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,940
"'For if I go not away,

289
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,600
"'the Comforter will not come unto you,

290
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,300
"'but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.'"

291
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,380
And then we find that if you skip down just a few verses,

292
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,660
in verse number 13, it says,

293
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,740
"'How be it when He,'

294
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,740
now notice, it tells us that He's the Comforter

295
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,700
in verse number seven,

296
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,860
but another title that is given to the Holy Spirit

297
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,780
is provided in verse number 13,

298
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,780
"'How be it when He, the Spirit of truth, is come.

299
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,240
"'He will guide you into all truth.'"

300
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,940
Now, those words should be precious to us

301
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,420
as the children of God.

302
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,180
He didn't say that He might guide you into some truth.

303
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,180
He said that He will guide you into all truth.

304
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,460
And we ought to rejoice in that.

305
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,940
And as we look here at the passage of Scripture,

306
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,820
He continues and says,

307
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,500
"'For He shall not speak of Himself,

308
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,040
"'but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,

309
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,220
"'and He will show you things to come.'"

310
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,900
And we rejoice this morning

311
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,500
as we consider the subject from 1 John 4,

312
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,340
how is it that I try the spirits?

313
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,620
Well, it's the enabling of the Holy Spirit of God

314
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,720
that indwells us,

315
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,640
because He will guide us into all truth.

316
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
Listen, we must take God at His word.

317
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,400
We must believe that God has given us that which we need.

318
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,080
And as we run to the truth of John 16,

319
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
we ought to rejoice that,

320
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,240
listen, God, you told us to not believe every spirit.

321
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,960
You told us to try the spirits.

322
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,520
And there's this situation here.

323
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,680
There's something that I've been confronted with.

324
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,880
And Holy Spirit of God,

325
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
I need you to guide me into all truth.

326
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,040
Help me to understand, enable me.

327
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,380
We find that not only has He given us

328
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,720
the Holy Spirit of God

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,620
and the enabling of the Holy Spirit

330
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,720
to enable us to be able to try the spirits,

331
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,080
but we also find that we're to examine

332
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,240
by using the scriptures.

333
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,520
The word of God says to try the spirits.

334
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,040
Again, that word means to test, prove, or examine.

335
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
It's seeking to determine

336
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,300
whether something is genuine or authentic.

337
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,400
And so what do I use?

338
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,120
I use, not only do I have the Holy Spirit of God

339
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,540
that indwells me, He enables me,

340
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,740
but we also examine through using the word of God.

341
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,660
The word of God is our standard.

342
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,580
The word of God is the truth.

343
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,980
We dealt with that last week

344
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,020
as we spoke about the truth shall make you free.

345
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,179
And as we find this morning here

346
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,220
in 1 John 4, in this exhortation

347
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,260
that is given, this counsel or advice

348
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,380
that God is providing to His people,

349
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,540
He says, believe not every spirit,

350
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,839
but try the spirits.

351
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,420
I need to examine the scriptures.

352
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,380
I need the help, the enabling of the Holy Spirit of God,

353
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
but now as New Testament believers,

354
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,179
we have the whole canon of scripture.

355
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,860
He has given us the entirety of the word.

356
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,360
You understand, and many people get twisted up

357
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,140
with this today, but you understand

358
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,860
that the apostolic sign gifts,

359
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,619
as we would refer to those as,

360
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,240
that as you study the New Testament

361
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,779
before the scriptures were completed,

362
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,940
if you read 1 Corinthians chapter 13,

363
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,420
it's very clear at the end of the text of scripture,

364
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,320
when that as perfect as come,

365
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,820
then that which is in part shall be done away with.

366
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,460
And we find that these apostolic sign gifts

367
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,220
that were given were given for the purpose

368
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,779
of authenticating the message.

369
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,500
We don't need the apostolic sign gifts anymore.

370
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,339
Why?

371
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,920
Because we have that which is perfect.

372
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,020
We have the whole counsel, the whole canon of scripture,

373
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,100
and we are to examine the word of God.

374
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,059
So listen, this morning, the false teaching

375
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,700
that is prevalent, we find that the exhortation

376
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
is given to the people of God

377
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
that were to believe not every spirit,

378
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,619
were to try the spirits.

379
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:52,960
Why is it that God would give us this exhortation?

380
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,839
Well, it's because of, if you're taking notes this morning,

381
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
the existence of false teachers.

382
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,899
The existence of false teachers.

383
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,700
I believe this morning that the existence

384
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
of false teachers is what necessitates the exhortation

385
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,580
that we find at the beginning of verse number one,

386
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,660
here in 1 John chapter number four.

387
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,119
And we find that as you read the end of the first verse,

388
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,700
it says, it tells us why the exhortation is given,

389
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,140
because of the existence of these false teachers.

390
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,020
It says, because many false prophets

391
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,760
are gone out into the world.

392
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,500
So God gives us the answer as to why

393
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,380
the exhortation is needed.

394
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,000
Why it is that He's provided us with this exhortation

395
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,080
is because of the existence of these false teachers.

396
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,720
You understand this morning that the scriptures say this

397
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,920
in verse number one, because many false prophets

398
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
are gone out into the world.

399
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,920
There's not just one false teacher.

400
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
There are many false prophets.

401
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,399
He tells them in verse number three

402
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,640
at the end of the verse, it says this,

403
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,600
and this is that spirit of antichrist,

404
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,520
whereof ye have heard that it should come,

405
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,520
notice what it says, and even now already is it

406
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,380
the spirit of antichrist in the world.

407
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,080
The book of 1 John was written

408
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
near the end of the first century.

409
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,000
And here we are in 2022, and we find that the false teachers

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,540
have continued to multiply.

411
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,880
There are many false teachers, many false prophets.

412
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,800
As we begin to think about the existence

413
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,399
of these false teachers, we made mention

414
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,040
by way of introduction to 1 John 2 in verse number 18,

415
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,679
and it's there where it says,

416
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,240
even now are there many antichrists.

417
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,000
And we find that this spirit of antichrist

418
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
that John mentions in 1 John chapter number four,

419
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,279
this existence of false teachers,

420
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,279
that they are seeking to go and to permeate the world.

421
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,760
Last week, we mentioned in our study

422
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,320
of the truth shall make you free,

423
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,320
we said this, that there is a blinding from truth.

424
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,279
You know one of the ways in which the enemy

425
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,160
blinds people from truth?

426
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,320
False teachers.

427
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,679
You know the hardest truth to identify

428
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
is the one that's close, or excuse me,

429
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,480
the most difficult false teaching to identify

430
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,520
is the one that's closest to the truth.

431
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
Where is it?

432
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,960
They try to get it as close to the truth as they can,

433
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,479
but there's just a couple of nuances.

434
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,640
They mean something different by the words that they use.

435
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,799
I've often said this over the years,

436
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,720
that they, false teachers, they will use our vocabulary,

437
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
but not our dictionary.

438
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,479
What do I mean by that?

439
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,039
Well, they might use some of the same words

440
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,320
that we're familiar with,

441
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,600
but they mean something entirely different.

442
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,880
Have you been born again?

443
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,960
Well, we understand what it means to be born again,

444
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,760
and we would understand as we hear that terminology,

445
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,679
perhaps this morning your mind would race

446
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,720
to the book of John in the third chapter

447
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
when Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus,

448
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,280
that man that was full of religion, by the way.

449
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,799
And Jesus said to that religious leader,

450
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,239
he said, ye must be born again.

451
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
And Nicodemus said, how can a man be born again

452
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
when he's old?

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,520
Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time?

454
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
He's confused.

455
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,559
Jesus makes it very plain.

456
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,559
There is a physical birth, and there is a spiritual birth.

457
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,799
And that being born again is the spiritual birth,

458
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,479
the second birth.

459
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,039
You talk to some today, you use that terminology,

460
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,280
have you been born again?

461
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,679
Oh yeah, I've been baptized.

462
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,400
That's not what it means to be born again.

463
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I'd ask if you were baptized.

464
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh yeah, I've said my first Holy Communion,

465
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,400
I've done this, I've done that, some religious exercise.

466
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,679
But that's not being born again.

467
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,479
Being born again is.

468
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,019
understanding that we're dead

469
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,359
in our sins and our trespasses.

470
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,299
Understanding that we are guilty.

471
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,559
Amen?

472
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,059
For all have sinned

473
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,239
and come short of the glory of God.

474
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,079
And I'm guilty.

475
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,719
And because of my guilt,

476
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,939
because of my sin,

477
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:24,039
I stand under judgment.

478
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,879
He that believeth not is condemned already.

479
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,419
I stand under the judgment. Why?

480
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:33,239
Because our God is just.

481
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,399
And He's righteous.

482
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,199
And sin must be judged.

483
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,399
It must be dealt with.

484
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:42,679
And the penalty for sin is death.

485
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,479
But we recognize that God,

486
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,119
the same God who is just

487
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,879
and the same God who is righteous,

488
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,399
He's gracious and He's merciful.

489
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,599
And He paid the price for us.

490
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,279
And He went to that cruel cross

491
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,919
and He bled and died.

492
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,719
And the just for the unjust,

493
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,559
the truth of the vicarious

494
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,159
substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ

495
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,959
on that cross of Calvary,

496
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,879
He shed His precious blood.

497
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,879
He died.

498
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:12,119
He was buried.

499
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,679
And He rose again.

500
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,319
Why? To pay for the sin of mankind.

501
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,399
We recognize that we're sinners

502
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,559
and there's a penalty,

503
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,639
but Jesus paid the price.

504
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,039
How we ought to rejoice in that.

505
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,919
And then we read where the Bible says,

506
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,359
for whosoever shall call upon

507
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,679
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

508
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,399
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

509
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,879
Paul didn't tell them to get baptized.

510
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,919
After they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,

511
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,599
then they were baptized.

512
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,639
Believers baptism by immersion.

513
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,919
I find that this morning

514
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,959
they use our same vocabulary,

515
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,279
but they use a different dictionary.

516
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,079
The existence of false teachers.

517
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,719
Listen, it's so prevalent

518
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,839
in our society today.

519
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,559
You must be careful of what you watch.

520
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,519
You must be careful of what you listen to.

521
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,679
Listen, you can type in

522
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:13,719
and in just a moment

523
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:14,759
you can go to YouTube

524
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,559
and you can find all sorts of things.

525
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,279
You have a question

526
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,719
about something biblically.

527
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,359
And listen, the the enemy is crafty.

528
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,279
He's cunning.

529
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,319
And there's all sorts of false teaching

530
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,239
that is just all over the Internet.

531
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,799
These false teachers that are on TV.

532
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,159
I'm not saying every preacher

533
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,679
that's on TV is a false teacher,

534
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,519
but what I'm saying is

535
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,319
believe not every spirit.

536
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,839
Try the spirits.

537
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,039
That's the exhortation.

538
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,519
Why?

539
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,199
Why does God give us the exhortation?

540
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,439
Because they exist.

541
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,599
And there are many false prophets

542
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,999
that have gone out into the world.

543
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,439
The spirit of Antichrist.

544
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,039
You heard that it shall come.

545
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,839
It's already here.

546
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,239
This was written many, many centuries ago.

547
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:59,239
We find that the enemy uses

548
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:02,599
the false teachers to blind men

549
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,079
from the truth.

550
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,079
Someone said this,

551
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,479
that the author of much

552
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,759
of the theology books

553
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,559
that are written today

554
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,039
or many of the theology books

555
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,719
that are written today

556
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,479
would be Satan himself.

557
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,439
You say, what in the world is that?

558
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,239
That's a shocking statement.

559
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,959
No, because he wants to

560
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,519
send forth that false teaching.

561
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,039
You know, most false teachers,

562
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,199
as you look at the truth

563
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:28,839
of the Word of God,

564
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,239
and this is where we get the exposure,

565
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:30,919
if you're taking notes,

566
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,079
number three this morning,

567
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,439
the exposure of false teachers.

568
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,999
It's given to us here

569
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,319
how we can identify,

570
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,319
how we can expose the false teachers,

571
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,119
because where they mess up

572
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,759
is with Jesus.

573
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,919
False teaching,

574
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,439
the consistent point

575
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,639
in which they fail and they miss

576
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,359
is on the person of Jesus Christ.

577
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,039
Why is that?

578
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,759
Because it makes all the difference.

579
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,879
Do you remember when Jesus

580
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,039
said to the disciples,

581
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,519
he's there and he's speaking

582
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,159
to the disciples and he says,

583
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,759
listen, whom do men say that I am?

584
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,479
Peter's the one that stands up,

585
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,639
and Peter very quickly,

586
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,119
actually before Peter speaks up,

587
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,719
the disciples, they kind of offer an answer,

588
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,559
and there's many probably that speak up.

589
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,479
They say, well, some think

590
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,119
you're John the Baptist or Isaiah

591
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,079
or Jeremiah or one of the prophets.

592
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,319
Can I tell you this morning

593
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,039
that the false teachers don't care

594
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,119
if you think Jesus is a prophet?

595
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,919
The false teachers,

596
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:29,919
they don't care if you think

597
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,279
that that Jesus was a good man.

598
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,279
Jesus said, who do they say that I am?

599
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,239
Isaiah, Jeremiah,

600
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,879
one of the prophets, John the Baptist.

601
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:48,119
Then Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

602
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,879
And Peter then stands up and says,

603
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,599
thou art the Christ,

604
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,079
the son of the living God,

605
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,879
the Messiah, the promised one.

606
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,919
Paul would then later say to those

607
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,359
that he's speaking to in the book of Acts,

608
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,159
how that this Jesus whom I preach is Christ.

609
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,399
They knew who Jesus was as a person,

610
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,839
but they say he's let them know

611
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,959
that's Messiah.

612
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,799
He is Christ.

613
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,079
He is God in flesh.

614
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,479
And we find this morning

615
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,639
that many of the false teachers,

616
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:20,159
these false religious systems,

617
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,239
these false cults,

618
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,559
they get it wrong on Jesus.

619
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,719
They don't care if you think

620
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,799
that Jesus was a good teacher.

621
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,799
They don't care if you think

622
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,719
that Jesus was a prophet,

623
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,399
that he was.

624
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,239
They care if you believe that Jesus is God.

625
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,199
And this morning,

626
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,679
when we look at the text of Scripture

627
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,119
in First John, chapter four,

628
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,039
the exposure of false teachers

629
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,439
is provided for us.

630
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,679
Notice what the Bible says

631
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,759
in verse number two.

632
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,799
Hereby, no.

633
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,519
Now, remember, we looked at this word

634
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,159
at the end of chapter number three

635
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:53,959
in verse number 19.

636
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,639
Hereby, it says in hereby,

637
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,119
we know that we are of the truth.

638
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,039
And we mentioned this word hereby.

639
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,119
It means by this.

640
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,679
And we find here again

641
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,279
that we see this word.

642
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,839
No, God wants us to know.

643
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,719
He doesn't want us to be blinded.

644
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,199
He doesn't want us to be confused.

645
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,839
He wants us to know truth.

646
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,879
He is truth.

647
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:13,479
He's provided us with truth.

648
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:15,719
And the Bible says hereby, no.

649
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:17,759
Ye, the spirit of God.

650
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,799
Every spirit that confesses

651
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,399
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh

652
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:25,839
is of God.

653
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,159
Here's the test that we're going to provide.

654
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,279
Here's the examining,

655
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,279
trying the spirits.

656
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,679
He says every spirit

657
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,839
that confesses that Jesus Christ

658
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,359
has come in the flesh is of God.

659
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,719
We think about the person of Jesus Christ

660
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,119
and we understand this morning

661
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,079
his incarnation, his deity

662
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,199
in his work of redemption.

663
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,279
And that's where they get it wrong

664
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,719
on the person of Jesus Christ,

665
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,079
who he is and why he came,

666
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,079
what he came to do, what he accomplished.

667
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,759
Listen, it's Christ alone.

668
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,679
It's not Christ plus our works.

669
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:03,879
That's false teaching.

670
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,199
It's not Christ plus Mary.

671
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,599
That's false teaching.

672
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,559
It's Christ alone.

673
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,679
Amen.

674
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,959
And we find here that he says this,

675
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,719
that this spirit of God

676
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,839
hereby know ye the spirit of God.

677
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,479
Every spirit that confesses

678
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,879
that Jesus Christ has come

679
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:19,839
in the flesh is of God.

680
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,439
Notice in verse number three,

681
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,719
he says every spirit that confesses

682
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,999
not that Jesus Christ

683
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:29,639
has come in the flesh is not of God.

684
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,879
Pretty plain, is it not?

685
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:33,839
Now.

686
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,279
The plainness of the teaching.

687
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,279
Is evident through this passage,

688
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,799
the difficulty for us

689
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,799
on believe not every spirit

690
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,439
and try the spirits

691
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,519
is the craftiness of the enemy.

692
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,639
That's where it becomes difficult.

693
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:54,119
That's why we so desperately need

694
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,639
to depend upon the Holy Spirit of God

695
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,999
to enable us to understand

696
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,759
these this process

697
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,959
of trying the spirits.

698
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,599
That's why it's so imperative

699
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,399
that we know the word of God

700
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,519
and we're able to run to the scriptures.

701
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,639
I've had conversations with people,

702
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,399
countless conversations with people

703
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,759
that have been blinded by false teaching

704
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,359
that have believed a lie

705
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,439
and they're so convinced of it

706
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,079
because of what they experienced.

707
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:22,799
And it's critical

708
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,639
that we as the people of God,

709
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,119
that we depend,

710
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,319
we rely upon the Holy Spirit of God

711
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,519
to guide us into all truth.

712
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,319
And we go to the word of God

713
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,279
as the standard.

714
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,239
Listen, your experience

715
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,279
and my experience

716
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,079
do not trump the word of God.

717
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,799
There are people today,

718
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,079
it's actually extremely popular today

719
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,279
when we look at some of the

720
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,880
Pentecostal movement

721
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,679
and some of that

722
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,599
that we find that's so prevalent

723
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,760
in our society today,

724
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,880
where it's a lot about experience

725
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,839
and about emotion.

726
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,359
And here's what I've experienced.

727
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,279
And by the way,

728
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,320
if you talk to someone

729
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,599
that's experienced some of those things,

730
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,880
you're never going to convince them

731
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,760
that they didn't experience

732
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
what they experienced.

733
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:03,719
I've tried.

734
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,159
You'll drive yourself crazy.

735
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:07,679
Why?

736
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,959
Because they experienced it.

737
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:11,839
Because they experienced it.

738
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,519
Can I tell you this morning

739
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,799
that when Cornelius

740
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,239
received word from God,

741
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,079
that vision,

742
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,279
that didn't save him.

743
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,799
You know what Cornelius was told?

744
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,039
Send for Peter

745
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,919
and Peter will tell you.

746
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,839
Man, that's power.

747
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,359
You go to the word of God.

748
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:32,679
I've been to heaven

749
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,399
and I'm going to tell you

750
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,359
what heaven's all about.

751
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,639
We got people making movies

752
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,559
and writing books

753
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,479
and all sorts of things.

754
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,479
And people listen,

755
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,839
God's people are buying that stuff

756
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,880
and watching that stuff

757
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,119
and reading that stuff.

758
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,719
But you know what Paul said

759
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,399
after he was caught up

760
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,079
to the third heaven?

761
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm not permitted to talk about it.

762
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,599
So if Paul couldn't talk about it,

763
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,559
you think some little kid

764
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,639
is allowed to talk about it?

765
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.

766
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,079
God's given us in his word

767
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,079
what heaven's about,

768
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,559
what he wants us to know.

769
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,279
know heaven is about.

770
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,639
And the things that He's not told us,

771
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:06,799
obviously we don't need to know.

772
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,119
Amen?

773
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,559
And listen, this morning when we look at this exposure

774
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,959
of false teachers, the instruction is simple.

775
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:19,879
The outworking, the going through the process

776
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,339
is what becomes difficult, why?

777
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:24,199
Because of the craftiness of the enemy.

778
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,119
Take your Bible and turn to the book of 2 Corinthians

779
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,279
in chapter number 11.

780
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,159
I want you to see the craftiness of the enemy

781
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,979
as God would give us this truth

782
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:34,959
in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11.

783
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,319
And I want you to understand that as the people of God,

784
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,699
we must take heed to the word of God.

785
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,279
We must understand and take heed to this exhortation

786
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,239
that starts the passage of scripture

787
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,039
in 1 John chapter number four.

788
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,359
Believe not every spirit, try the spirits.

789
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,199
Why?

790
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,779
Why this exhortation?

791
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,539
Because of the existence, there are many false prophets

792
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,339
that have gone out into the world.

793
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,939
And how are these false prophets, these false teachers,

794
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:03,339
how are they exposed?

795
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:06,919
We must depend and rely upon the Holy Spirit of God

796
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,579
to guide us into all truth.

797
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,540
We must use the word of God, examining the scriptures,

798
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,259
examining their teaching and their beliefs

799
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,680
and what they peddle according to the word of God.

800
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,839
Notice in 2 Corinthians 11 in verse number 13.

801
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,540
The Bible says this,

802
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,540
for such are false apostles, deceitful workers,

803
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:39,139
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

804
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,979
Notice verse 14, and no marvel,

805
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:51,979
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

806
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:57,339
So what do we read in verse number 15?

807
00:31:57,339 --> 00:32:00,720
Therefore, as we understand this truth,

808
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,619
as we understand these false apostles,

809
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:03,819
these deceitful workers,

810
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,299
we understand that they've transformed themselves

811
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,939
into the apostles of Christ.

812
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:10,979
We understand this morning that Paul says

813
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,739
to the believers in Corinth, listen, don't marvel at that,

814
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:16,979
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

815
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:21,619
Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers

816
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:25,619
also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness,

817
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,339
whose end shall be according to their works.

818
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,139
The craftiness and the deceitfulness, listen,

819
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,619
I don't know where it originated,

820
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,099
but somebody has depicted that Satan runs around

821
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,020
with a pitchfork and a pointy tail.

822
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,539
You've seen it depicted that way.

823
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,259
That's just not Bible.

824
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,679
Listen, if he always appeared that way,

825
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,039
it'd be easy to identify him, right?

826
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,619
But he transforms himself into an angel of light.

827
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,679
Oh, this is where it becomes absolutely necessary

828
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,880
for us as the people of God to take heed

829
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,800
to this exhortation in 1 John chapter number four,

830
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,720
believe not every spirit.

831
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,319
You know how many people see some crafty work of the enemy,

832
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,399
some hocus-pocus nonsense that goes on,

833
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,880
and they say, well, they did this.

834
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,599
I had somebody tell me 10 years ago,

835
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,720
they said, well, pastor,

836
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,239
I just want you to know about this person.

837
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,440
They called me pastor.

838
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,880
They weren't a member of our church.

839
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,520
They said, pastor, I just want you to know

840
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,440
that this is what happened.

841
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,599
What do you think about this person?

842
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,720
I said, that's a false teacher.

843
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,020
They named the person by name,

844
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,959
and I said, they're a false teacher.

845
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,239
Well, I just want you to know

846
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,839
that there was some person there,

847
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,239
and it was a healing situation,

848
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:40,000
and they had a glass eye,

849
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,940
and that guy touched their forehead, and they could see.

850
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,599
I was like, you believe that?

851
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,199
I mean, that was my, I wasn't trying to be unkind,

852
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,319
but I was astounded at the fact that they believed that.

853
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,720
That's what they believed.

854
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,000
You know that many of those healing

855
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,559
situations that you read of, it's a bunch of nonsense.

856
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,039
Just do a little research.

857
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,080
It's nonsense, and by the way,

858
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,559
if you look in the New Testament,

859
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,080
anytime somebody was healed,

860
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,419
it didn't profit the person that healed them.

861
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,399
Amen?

862
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,119
You look at the faith healers today,

863
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,859
they're living in luxury,

864
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,119
and if they really had the gift of healing,

865
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,919
which they don't biblically,

866
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,480
listen, our God still heals,

867
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,299
but he doesn't use faith healers.

868
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,359
Okay, we must understand that this morning,

869
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,440
and if they really had the ability to heal,

870
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,160
why don't they go and show up at some places

871
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,239
where people are really sick?

872
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,679
Why do they turn away the people

873
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,619
that aren't gonna participate and play their little game,

874
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:49,500
and then they just put it on them?

875
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,459
Well, you just don't have enough faith.

876
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,720
Peter and Paul, you read in the book of Acts,

877
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,980
when they healed, you know what they,

878
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,540
when they healed, you know why?

879
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,299
Again, the sign gifts, it would authenticate their message.

880
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:07,139
Do you remember, turn back, if you will,

881
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,019
to the book of Acts, and let's look at this passage quickly

882
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,260
in closing this morning.

883
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,220
I want you to look in Acts chapter 28.

884
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,139
In Acts chapter number 28,

885
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,019
they had just been shipwrecked.

886
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:27,019
They end up on the island Melita,

887
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,660
and the Bible tells us that the people there

888
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,980
showed them kindness, but I want you to pick it up with me

889
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,679
in verse number three, that Paul was there.

890
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,500
Of course, he was the one that in Acts 27,

891
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,220
he told them not to go, and they went,

892
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,899
and they had that terrible storm.

893
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:38,739
They were shipwrecked.

894
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,419
Paul stood up and said, I believe God,

895
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:42,059
and all that transpired.

896
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,540
They get there to Melita,

897
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
and the Bible tells us that Paul, in verse number three,

898
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,940
gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire.

899
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,119
Notice the end of verse number three,

900
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,700
there came a viper out of the heat

901
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,739
and fastened onto his hand.

902
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:54,660
That's a problem.

903
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,279
That'd be a real problem for me.

904
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,320
I'd just have a heart attack, amen?

905
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,899
I'm just being honest with you.

906
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:01,220
You say, pastor, you have heart problems?

907
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,980
Not that I know of, but if I had a viper on me,

908
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,739
I'd have heart problems.

909
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,619
And the Bible says this, notice in verse number four,

910
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,059
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast

911
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:14,179
hang on his hand, they said among themselves,

912
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:18,339
no doubt this man is a murderer,

913
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,459
whom though he hath escaped the sea,

914
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:24,480
yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

915
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,019
Paul's a murderer.

916
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,339
That's their conclusion.

917
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,179
But then Paul shakes it off.

918
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:32,040
Can you imagine?

919
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,100
It says this in verse number five,

920
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,559
he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm.

921
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,419
How be it they looked when he should have swollen

922
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,200
or fallen down dead suddenly,

923
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,639
but after they had looked a great while

924
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,359
and saw no harm come on him,

925
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:50,359
they changed their minds and said that he was a God.

926
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,899
In verse number seven, in the same quarters

927
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:56,639
were possessions of the chief man of the island,

928
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,799
whose name was Publius, who received us

929
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,600
and lodged us three days courteously.

930
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,779
And it came to pass that the father of Publius

931
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:04,600
lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux

932
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,459
to whom Paul entered in and prayed

933
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:09,139
and laid his hands on him and healed him.

934
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:11,000
Notice the Bible tells us that he healed him.

935
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,619
There were others there in verse number nine

936
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,079
and you notice what's taking place.

937
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,779
And I believe with all of my heart,

938
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:16,820
as you look at Acts 28,

939
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,859
we don't have all the time to develop it this morning,

940
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,260
but the reason that Paul was able to heal them

941
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,799
and the reason that God allowed that

942
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:25,179
was so that it would authenticate the message

943
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,720
that he would preach the gospel to these people in Melita

944
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
and they would get saved.

945
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,899
And you read this over and over in the book of Acts.

946
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:36,119
Listen, these false teachers that we read of

947
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:39,239
as Paul was exposing them in 2 Corinthians 11,

948
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,559
listen, they want to transform themselves

949
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,519
into the ministers of Christ

950
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,660
because listen, it's no small thing.

951
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,000
We should not marvel because Satan himself

952
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,079
is transformed into an angel of light.

953
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,959
And so we must take heed, we must acknowledge here

954
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:57,600
in 2 Corinthians 11 that this takes place.

955
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,720
I talked to a man probably 18 years ago

956
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,279
and he said, yeah, I know I'm saved.

957
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,279
I said, how do you know you're saved?

958
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,160
That's wonderful, tell me how you got saved.

959
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,239
He said, well, I got home

960
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,359
and I was having a really bad time.

961
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,200
My wife and I were just dealing with almost getting divorced

962
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,119
and all this sort of thing

963
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,239
and work was going bad and all these things

964
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,220
and I sat on the corner of my bed after a long day at work

965
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,239
and as I sat in the corner of my bed, Mary walked in.

966
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,139
I thought Mary was his wife, honestly.

967
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:24,380
I was just, it was like 18 years ago.

968
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,639
I could almost take you to the door in Exton, Virginia

969
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,339
where I was when I knocked on the door of that person.

970
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,239
And he said, Mary walked in.

971
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,119
He was speaking of seeing some person, Mary,

972
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,419
the mother of Jesus is who he was speaking of.

973
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
And he said, Mary lifted my hand

974
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,760
and led me over to the window

975
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,400
and told me to look out the window.

976
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,919
In all sincerity, he said, come over here.

977
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,960
He said, I looked out my window and I saw right there

978
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
and there was Jesus and I know I'm saved.

979
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,760
He believed that experience with all of his heart.

980
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,700
He believed it.

981
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,799
There was nothing I could say to that man on that day

982
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:11,719
that would convince him

983
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,099
that he did not experience what he experienced.

984
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,799
But when we understand the whole of scripture,

985
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,919
we say, listen, no marvel.

986
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,960
For Satan himself transformed himself

987
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,460
into an angel of light.

988
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Listen, Satan will do anything that he is permitted to do

989
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:31,460
because he's not God.

990
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,219
Satan will do anything he has permitted to do

991
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:38,059
to blind people from the truth.

992
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,299
And we find this exposure of false teachers.

993
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,580
Listen this morning.

994
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,619
It is so imperative for us this morning

995
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,260
to take heed to the exhortation of 1 John 4

996
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,159
in verse number one.

997
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,580
Beloved, believe not every spirit.

998
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,380
Don't see them.

999
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:11,020
some hocus-pocus and just, they must be…no, no, believe not every spirit, try the spirits.

1000
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:19,620
Examine them, test them, prove them for the purpose to determine whether they're genuine.

1001
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:26,840
And we find that as we would rely upon the Holy Spirit of God and how we should rejoice

1002
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:34,040
this morning and thank God this morning that He's given us the Holy Spirit who will lead

1003
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,960
us into all truth.

1004
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,120
He will lead you into all truth.

1005
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,040
And how we should thank God that He's given us a Bible, the whole canon of Scripture,

1006
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,960
and we examine Scripture with Scripture.

1007
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,280
And we say, God, thank You for telling us about the false teachers, but thank You for

1008
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:03,120
instructing us on how we're to deal with false teaching and how we can overcome, defeat false

1009
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
teaching.

1010
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,960
Listen, there are certain men crept unawares who turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

1011
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,560
There are people, and I don't want to over-exaggerate, you can do some research and I can tell you

1012
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:29,160
some more things, but there are people that willingly take a position of church leadership

1013
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,880
to deceive.

1014
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,480
It happens.

1015
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,880
There are people that take oaths to do it.

1016
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,400
It's insane, but it's the work of the enemy.

1017
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,600
And so John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, beloved, believe

1018
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,200
not every spirit.

1019
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Try the spirits to see if they're of God.

1020
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,720
And he gives us some instruction this morning, oh, I hope that we take heed to the exhortation

1021
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,040
because false teachers still exist.

1022
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,160
They're all over the place, but God's exposed them.

1023
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Let's pray together.

1024
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,640
Father, we love You.

1025
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,960
We thank You for loving us.

1026
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,320
I thank You for the Word of God.

1027
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,279
I thank You for the Holy Spirit of God who indwells us, who is the Spirit of truth, who

1028
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:23,600
leads us, guides us into all truth.

1029
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:33,400
We acknowledge this morning the existence of false teachers, but God, we're thankful

1030
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:43,120
that You've given us this truth for how we can know their tactics, but also have victory

1031
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,400
and not be led astray.

1032
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,880
As we mentioned by way of introduction, what we're trying to avoid is that lack of stability,

1033
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,040
being tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

1034
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,860
We want to avoid that.

1035
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:05,100
We want to be, as Paul said to the believers in Colossians 1 and 23, we want to be grounded

1036
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,860
and settled, move not away from the truth of the gospel.

1037
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
And God, I pray that You'd help us.

1038
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,220
Help us to be careful with the things that we read.

1039
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,980
Help us to be careful with the things that we watch.

1040
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:33,020
Help us to be aware of the tactic, the craftiness of the enemy that lies in wait to deceive.

1041
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,779
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts as only You can this morning.

1042
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:43,059
Maybe this morning all of us should come and thank You for Your truth and for the Holy

1043
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,620
Spirit of God.

1044
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:54,860
Perhaps this morning there's one that's been given ear to false teaching.

1045
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,860
They've been deceived.

1046
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,340
Oh God, I pray that You'd help them this morning.

1047
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,460
Help them to follow the exhortation that's given in this passage of Scripture.

1048
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,779
God, if there's one that's not saved this morning, they've believed a lie of the enemy

1049
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:15,620
with regard to what salvation really is.

1050
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,500
God, I pray that today be the day of their salvation.

1051
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,779
Would You move and work as only You can.

1052
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:26,059
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do in our midst, for it's in Christ's

1053
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,059
name we pray.

1054
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:28,059
Would You stand with me?

1055
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,140
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1056
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,500
The end of each of our services we have a time of invitation, give you an opportunity

1057
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,980
to respond as the Holy Spirit of God has used the Word of God in your life this morning.

1058
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:42,899
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano and the altar is open.

1059
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:45,820
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

1060
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,059
for sure that heaven's your home.

1061
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,700
Maybe you just want to come and thank God.

1062
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,260
Maybe you just want to come this morning and ask God to protect you from false teaching

1063
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:00,339
that's so prevalent in our society today, and help you to follow the admonition that's

1064
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,339
been given, the exhortation.

1065
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,179
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
