00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
chapter 4, 1 John 4.

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:04.880
We'll be looking at v. 1-3 this morning.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.579
1 John 4.

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:09.140
And looking at v. 1-3.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.739
Notice with me in v. 1 of 1 John 4,

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.360
John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.120
says to these original recipients,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.319
of course preserved for us this morning,

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.239
beloved, believe not every spirit,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.799
but try the spirits,

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:29.520
whether they are of God.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.719
For as many false prophets are gone out

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.080
into the world,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.439
hereby know ye the Spirit of God.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:37.880
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.240
has come in the flesh is of God,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.400
and every spirit that confesseth not

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.319
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:45.880
is not of God.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.439
And this is that spirit of Antichrist,

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.439
whereof ye have heard that it should come,

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.880
and even now already is it in the world.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
Of course, the subject of false teaching

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.840
has been previously discussed several weeks ago,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.040
actually several months ago.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.839
We looked at 1 John 2 in v. 18-27.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:09.480
And as we looked at that passage of scripture

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.599
in v. 18 of 1 John 2,

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:12.839
the Bible says little children,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.559
it is the last time.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:17.639
And as you have heard that Antichrist shall come,

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.680
even now are there many Antichrists

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.199
whereby we know that it is the last time.

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:26.639
And John would continue through the end of the chapter,

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.120
really v. 27,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.279
dealing with the subject of false teachers

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:31.800
there in the second chapter.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.760
And then now again in the fourth chapter,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.839
the subject is brought up once again.

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:39.739
Now we understand that our enemy is relentless.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.500
We understand that not only is he relentless,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.160
but we find that he's crafty, he's cunning.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.720
And we find that his attack upon truth,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.879
even as we studied last week,

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:51.680
is continuing to march on,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.879
and he continues to undermine the truth

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.120
of the word of God.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.680
But I am thankful that as we go to the word of God,

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.800
we find that God regularly reminds us

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.599
not only of the desire of the enemy,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.480
but he also reveals to us the tactics of the enemy,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.240
and then provides for us clear instruction

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.600
on how we deal with and defeat the enemy.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.919
And we ought to rejoice in that this morning,

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.960
because it's not that God just told us

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.199
that they're false prophets and then false teachers

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.559
and then go figure it out.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.720
We find that he's given us the truth

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.880
that these false teachers exist.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.880
He's explained to us what their desire is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.600
and what their tactics are.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.679
And then he said, here's how you combat it.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.399
Here's how you deal with it.

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.240
And here's how you defeat it.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.919
As we look at the passage of scripture,

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.679
again, the revisiting of the subject matter

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.679
of false teaching, I've titled the message

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.880
from verse number one, try the spirits.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.440
And as we think about the passage of scripture

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.520
and the subject matter that is before us,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.080
let me say this, hold your place in 1 John chapter four,

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.000
we're gonna look at two verses of scripture

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because I wanna acknowledge this morning

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.839
at the very beginning of the message,

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.220
what is it, this question to be answered,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.080
what is it that we're really seeking to avoid?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.679
Look in the book of Ephesians, if you will,

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.000
the book of Ephesians in the fourth chapter,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.720
what is it that we're seeking to avoid?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.279
Why does God continue to give us truth

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.059
with regard to the false teachers that exist

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.860
and their tactics and so on and so forth,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.460
their desires to overcome?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.300
And we find that God gives us in his word

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.100
what it is that we're trying to avoid,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.279
what are we seeking to avoid through these messages?

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.899
Notice in Ephesians four and verse number 14,

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:42.880
that we henceforth be no more children

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.559
tossed to and fro and carried about

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.339
with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:55.339
and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.740
That's what we're trying to avoid.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.940
We're trying to avoid this instability

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.759
that you read of in verse number 14

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.580
where they're tossed to and fro

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.539
with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.380
It says in cunning craftiness,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.739
they lie in wait to deceive.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.420
And when we deal with the subject matter of false teaching,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.779
when God exposes the false teachers,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.820
when he gives us instruction for how to identify

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.619
and defeat false teaching,

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.019
we find that what we're seeking to avoid

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.040
is the pitfall that is spoken of here

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.059
of this lack of stability.

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.160
And what is it that we're trying to avoid?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.260
But then also, what is it that we're seeking to accomplish?

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.019
Turn to the book of Colossians, if you will,

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:42.899
just a few pages over in your Bible,

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:44.540
Colossians chapter number one,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.760
and I want you to see what it is

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.299
that we're seeking to accomplish.

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:48.980
What is it that we wanna avoid

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.660
is this lack of stability,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.579
this being tossed to and fro.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:54.500
What is it that we're seeking to accomplish?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.980
Well, in the book of Colossians in chapter number one

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.700
in verse number 23, notice what the Bible says.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.700
If you continue in the faith, grounded and settled,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.600
and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.700
which ye have heard,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.420
and which was preached to every creature

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.579
which is under heaven,

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.980
whereof I, Paul, am made a minister.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.779
You see a great contrast between Ephesians 4.14

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.739
and Colossians 1.23.

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:22.420
You find that in Ephesians 4, he's saying,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.579
listen, we wanna avoid this being tossed to and fro.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.339
We wanna avoid this instability.

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.980
We wanna avoid all of this false teaching

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.220
and being just going back and forth

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.859
between what it is that we believe.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:37.459
And in Colossians, he says,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.019
we wanna be grounded and settled,

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:45.739
and move not away from the hope of the gospel.

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:49.179
You see that which we're seeking to avoid,

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:52.380
but also what it is that we're seeking to accomplish.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.540
You know, God wants us to be grounded and settled.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.660
He wants us to know who he is,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.179
and he wants us to know what he has spoken.

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:05.100
And we find that he's given us the word of God,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.339
and we've been given precious instruction.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.540
We find that today, even as our passage would tell us

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.420
of these false teachers that exist,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.859
and there are many false prophets

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:17.100
that are gone out into the world,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.299
and we find that God gives us this instruction

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:21.859
in 1 John chapter number four.

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:23.579
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:24.980
I want you to notice, first of all,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.540
the exhortation to the believers.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.359
The exhortation to the believers.

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:31.899
I believe this morning, as we look at verse number one,

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:35.220
there's really a twofold exhortation that is given to us,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.380
and this is advice or counsel

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.019
that God is giving to the people of God,

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:41.760
those that have been born again,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.519
those that are following the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.959
We find that this exhortation is given.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.679
Notice in verse number one,

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.200
the first aspect of this exhortation,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.959
believe not every spirit.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.820
That's pretty simple, is it not?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.140
Believe not every spirit.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.440
We find that the second aspect of this exhortation

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.160
that God is giving to the people of God

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.600
and to us this morning,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.899
is not only that we would believe not every spirit,

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.980
but then notice what he says, try the spirits.

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:18.399
Try the spirits.

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:20.440
Now that word try is a very interesting word.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.200
It means to test, prove, or examine.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.839
The idea of the word try is to determine

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.760
if something is genuine or authentic.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.079
That's the idea behind the Greek word that is used here

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.119
that's translated in our Bibles, try.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.920
Try the spirits.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.640
That we're to test, prove, or examine them

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.339
for the purpose of seeking to determine

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.559
if something is genuine or authentic.

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:51.200
And we find that God has given this exhortation.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.160
He's provided this counsel,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.320
this advice for the people of God.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.799
And we find that as he's provided this to us,

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.200
our response to the exhortation

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.440
ought to be that we take heed.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.359
John says, beloved, believe not every spirit,

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:11.000
but try the spirits, whether they are of God.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.359
We find that here this exhortation is given

00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:16.359
and we are to try the spirits.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:18.799
The word of God uses regularly

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.040
and in the era in which they would use

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.399
this original language,

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:24.920
we find that the word try would be used often

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.839
with regard to metals.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.359
And they would try the metals.

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.359
They would seek to determine if the metals were pure,

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:33.640
if they were authentic, if they were genuine,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.440
or if someone was trying to sell you a counterfeit.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.559
That's how they would use the word.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.320
Very regularly in daily business and administration,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.799
they would use the same word in that manner.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:48.479
And we find that God is telling us as the people of God

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:51.000
that we're to try the spirits.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.320
We want to be able to examine.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.760
We want to test and prove.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.000
We want to determine that they're genuine,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.679
that they're authentic.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.320
We ask ourselves this question,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.200
how is it that I try the spirits?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.719
What is it that I would do?

00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.799
How is it that I would be able to take heed

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.840
to this instruction that has been given?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.440
And I find it's very interesting

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.359
as you conclude the third chapter of 1 John,

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:16.520
God gives us some great insight.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.840
Now you understand this morning

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.280
that these chapter divisions

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.880
and the verse references were added

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.640
after the originals were given

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.119
for ease of being able to find and follow and read.

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:29.640
It'd be a challenging thing this morning

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.159
if I said just turn to the book of 1 John

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.719
and find where I'm reading.

00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:36.320
And so we have these chapter divisions in these verses,

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.919
but if you look in chapter number three

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:39.320
and verse number 24,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200
and we dealt with this a couple of weeks ago,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.599
it says, and he that keepeth his commandments

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:46.080
dwelleth in him and he in him.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.000
Notice what he says,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.080
and hereby we know that he abideth in us

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.960
by the spirit which he hath given us.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.799
And we rejoice in the truth,

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:58.719
the reality of his abiding presence,

00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:00.320
when we speak about the...

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.520
the Holy Spirit of God that is mentioned

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.060
in 1 John 3 and verse 24.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.520
But when we understand the truth

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.140
of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.180
yes, He's the Comforter.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.060
But He's also the Teacher.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.020
He is the Divine Teacher.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.280
And God in His awesome plan.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.180
I mean, God is supreme.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.940
He's nothing that He's not thought of.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.420
Right? He's God.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.020
And in His awesome plan,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.420
He determined for New Testament believers

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.160
that at the moment of salvation,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.340
the Holy Spirit of God would indwell us.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.740
And as the Holy Spirit of God

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.020
indwells every believer today,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.660
we find that yes, He is the earnest

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.460
of our inheritance.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.420
We find the proof, if you will,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.700
of our redemption is that the Holy Spirit of God

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.100
indwells the believer.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.420
But we find that yes, He's our Comforter.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.220
And we rejoice in that comfort.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.220
And we often wonder as we would go through

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.220
the trials and difficulties of life,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.700
how is it that someone that does not know

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.220
the God of all comfort,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.340
someone that does not have the Comforter

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.700
that indwells them,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.300
how do they deal with some of the things of life?

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.060
And we rejoice in having the Comforter.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.060
But He's also the Teacher.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.820
And He leads us into all truth.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.580
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.780
See, Jesus, as He's speaking to His disciples

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.620
in the book of John,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.980
before He would go to the cross of Calvary,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.020
we find that Jesus is giving them wonderful truth

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.320
with regard to the things that would take place

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.820
and the responsibilities that they would have

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.180
with regard to ministry.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.860
And He's providing them with great instruction.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.180
And He tells them about sending the Holy Spirit of God,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.860
sending the Comforter.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.300
And He mentions that in a few passages

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.300
in this section of the book of John.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.840
But in John chapter number 16, in verse number seven,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.700
He says this to the disciples,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.860
"'Nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.820
"'It is expedient for you that I go away.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.940
"'For if I go not away,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.600
"'the Comforter will not come unto you,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.300
"'but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.'"

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.380
And then we find that if you skip down just a few verses,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.660
in verse number 13, it says,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.740
"'How be it when He,'

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.740
now notice, it tells us that He's the Comforter

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.700
in verse number seven,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.860
but another title that is given to the Holy Spirit

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.780
is provided in verse number 13,

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.780
"'How be it when He, the Spirit of truth, is come.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.240
"'He will guide you into all truth.'"

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.940
Now, those words should be precious to us

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.420
as the children of God.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.180
He didn't say that He might guide you into some truth.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.180
He said that He will guide you into all truth.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.460
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.940
And as we look here at the passage of Scripture,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.820
He continues and says,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.500
"'For He shall not speak of Himself,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.040
"'but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.220
"'and He will show you things to come.'"

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.900
And we rejoice this morning

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.500
as we consider the subject from 1 John 4,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.340
how is it that I try the spirits?

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.620
Well, it's the enabling of the Holy Spirit of God

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.720
that indwells us,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.640
because He will guide us into all truth.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.560
Listen, we must take God at His word.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.400
We must believe that God has given us that which we need.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.080
And as we run to the truth of John 16,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.280
we ought to rejoice that,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.240
listen, God, you told us to not believe every spirit.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.960
You told us to try the spirits.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.520
And there's this situation here.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.680
There's something that I've been confronted with.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.880
And Holy Spirit of God,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.920
I need you to guide me into all truth.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.040
Help me to understand, enable me.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.380
We find that not only has He given us

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.720
the Holy Spirit of God

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.620
and the enabling of the Holy Spirit

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.720
to enable us to be able to try the spirits,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.080
but we also find that we're to examine

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.240
by using the scriptures.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.520
The word of God says to try the spirits.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.040
Again, that word means to test, prove, or examine.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.720
It's seeking to determine

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.300
whether something is genuine or authentic.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.400
And so what do I use?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.120
I use, not only do I have the Holy Spirit of God

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.540
that indwells me, He enables me,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.740
but we also examine through using the word of God.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.660
The word of God is our standard.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.580
The word of God is the truth.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.980
We dealt with that last week

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.020
as we spoke about the truth shall make you free.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.179
And as we find this morning here

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:34.220
in 1 John 4, in this exhortation

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.260
that is given, this counsel or advice

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.380
that God is providing to His people,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.540
He says, believe not every spirit,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.839
but try the spirits.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.420
I need to examine the scriptures.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.380
I need the help, the enabling of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.380
but now as New Testament believers,

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.179
we have the whole canon of scripture.

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:55.860
He has given us the entirety of the word.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.360
You understand, and many people get twisted up

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.140
with this today, but you understand

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.860
that the apostolic sign gifts,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.619
as we would refer to those as,

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:06.240
that as you study the New Testament

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.779
before the scriptures were completed,

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.940
if you read 1 Corinthians chapter 13,

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:13.420
it's very clear at the end of the text of scripture,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.320
when that as perfect as come,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.820
then that which is in part shall be done away with.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.460
And we find that these apostolic sign gifts

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.220
that were given were given for the purpose

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.779
of authenticating the message.

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:29.500
We don't need the apostolic sign gifts anymore.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.339
Why?

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.920
Because we have that which is perfect.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.020
We have the whole counsel, the whole canon of scripture,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.100
and we are to examine the word of God.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.059
So listen, this morning, the false teaching

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:43.700
that is prevalent, we find that the exhortation

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.500
is given to the people of God

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.300
that were to believe not every spirit,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.619
were to try the spirits.

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:52.960
Why is it that God would give us this exhortation?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.839
Well, it's because of, if you're taking notes this morning,

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.800
the existence of false teachers.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.899
The existence of false teachers.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:02.700
I believe this morning that the existence

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.500
of false teachers is what necessitates the exhortation

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.580
that we find at the beginning of verse number one,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.660
here in 1 John chapter number four.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.119
And we find that as you read the end of the first verse,

00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:16.700
it says, it tells us why the exhortation is given,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.140
because of the existence of these false teachers.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.020
It says, because many false prophets

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.760
are gone out into the world.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.500
So God gives us the answer as to why

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.380
the exhortation is needed.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.000
Why it is that He's provided us with this exhortation

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.080
is because of the existence of these false teachers.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.720
You understand this morning that the scriptures say this

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.920
in verse number one, because many false prophets

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.360
are gone out into the world.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.920
There's not just one false teacher.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.160
There are many false prophets.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.399
He tells them in verse number three

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.640
at the end of the verse, it says this,

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.600
and this is that spirit of antichrist,

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.520
whereof ye have heard that it should come,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.520
notice what it says, and even now already is it

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.380
the spirit of antichrist in the world.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.080
The book of 1 John was written

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.960
near the end of the first century.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.000
And here we are in 2022, and we find that the false teachers

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.540
have continued to multiply.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.880
There are many false teachers, many false prophets.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.800
As we begin to think about the existence

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.399
of these false teachers, we made mention

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:36.040
by way of introduction to 1 John 2 in verse number 18,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.679
and it's there where it says,

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:41.240
even now are there many antichrists.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.000
And we find that this spirit of antichrist

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080
that John mentions in 1 John chapter number four,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.279
this existence of false teachers,

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:55.279
that they are seeking to go and to permeate the world.

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:58.760
Last week, we mentioned in our study

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.320
of the truth shall make you free,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.320
we said this, that there is a blinding from truth.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.279
You know one of the ways in which the enemy

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.160
blinds people from truth?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.320
False teachers.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:17.679
You know the hardest truth to identify

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.520
is the one that's close, or excuse me,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.480
the most difficult false teaching to identify

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.520
is the one that's closest to the truth.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.240
Where is it?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.960
They try to get it as close to the truth as they can,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.479
but there's just a couple of nuances.

00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:37.640
They mean something different by the words that they use.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.799
I've often said this over the years,

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:44.720
that they, false teachers, they will use our vocabulary,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.320
but not our dictionary.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.479
What do I mean by that?

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:50.039
Well, they might use some of the same words

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.320
that we're familiar with,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.600
but they mean something entirely different.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.880
Have you been born again?

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.960
Well, we understand what it means to be born again,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.760
and we would understand as we hear that terminology,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.679
perhaps this morning your mind would race

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:04.720
to the book of John in the third chapter

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.640
when Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.280
that man that was full of religion, by the way.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.799
And Jesus said to that religious leader,

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:17.239
he said, ye must be born again.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.000
And Nicodemus said, how can a man be born again

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
when he's old?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.520
Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time?

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.760
He's confused.

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.559
Jesus makes it very plain.

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:31.559
There is a physical birth, and there is a spiritual birth.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.799
And that being born again is the spiritual birth,

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.479
the second birth.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.039
You talk to some today, you use that terminology,

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.280
have you been born again?

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.679
Oh yeah, I've been baptized.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.400
That's not what it means to be born again.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.400
I'd ask if you were baptized.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.880
Oh yeah, I've said my first Holy Communion,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.400
I've done this, I've done that, some religious exercise.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.679
But that's not being born again.

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:00.479
Being born again is.

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.019
understanding that we're dead

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:04.359
in our sins and our trespasses.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:08.299
Understanding that we are guilty.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:09.559
Amen?

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:11.059
For all have sinned

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:15.239
and come short of the glory of God.

00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:17.079
And I'm guilty.

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:18.719
And because of my guilt,

00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.939
because of my sin,

00:20:20.939 --> 00:20:24.039
I stand under judgment.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:29.879
He that believeth not is condemned already.

00:20:29.879 --> 00:20:31.419
I stand under the judgment. Why?

00:20:31.419 --> 00:20:33.239
Because our God is just.

00:20:33.239 --> 00:20:35.399
And He's righteous.

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:37.199
And sin must be judged.

00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:38.399
It must be dealt with.

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:42.679
And the penalty for sin is death.

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:44.479
But we recognize that God,

00:20:44.479 --> 00:20:46.119
the same God who is just

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.879
and the same God who is righteous,

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.399
He's gracious and He's merciful.

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.599
And He paid the price for us.

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:55.279
And He went to that cruel cross

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:56.919
and He bled and died.

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:59.719
And the just for the unjust,

00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:02.559
the truth of the vicarious

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:05.159
substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.959
on that cross of Calvary,

00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:08.879
He shed His precious blood.

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:10.879
He died.

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:12.119
He was buried.

00:21:12.119 --> 00:21:13.679
And He rose again.

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:20.319
Why? To pay for the sin of mankind.

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:23.399
We recognize that we're sinners

00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:24.559
and there's a penalty,

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.639
but Jesus paid the price.

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:29.039
How we ought to rejoice in that.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.919
And then we read where the Bible says,

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:33.359
for whosoever shall call upon

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:37.679
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:43.399
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:21:43.399 --> 00:21:45.879
Paul didn't tell them to get baptized.

00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:48.919
After they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:50.599
then they were baptized.

00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:55.639
Believers baptism by immersion.

00:21:55.639 --> 00:21:57.919
I find that this morning

00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:59.959
they use our same vocabulary,

00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:02.279
but they use a different dictionary.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.079
The existence of false teachers.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.719
Listen, it's so prevalent

00:22:05.719 --> 00:22:06.839
in our society today.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.559
You must be careful of what you watch.

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:11.519
You must be careful of what you listen to.

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:12.679
Listen, you can type in

00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:13.719
and in just a moment

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:14.759
you can go to YouTube

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:16.559
and you can find all sorts of things.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.279
You have a question

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:18.719
about something biblically.

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:21.359
And listen, the the enemy is crafty.

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:22.279
He's cunning.

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:24.319
And there's all sorts of false teaching

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:27.239
that is just all over the Internet.

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:29.799
These false teachers that are on TV.

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:31.159
I'm not saying every preacher

00:22:31.159 --> 00:22:32.679
that's on TV is a false teacher,

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:33.519
but what I'm saying is

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.319
believe not every spirit.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.839
Try the spirits.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:38.039
That's the exhortation.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:38.519
Why?

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:40.199
Why does God give us the exhortation?

00:22:40.199 --> 00:22:42.439
Because they exist.

00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:44.599
And there are many false prophets

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.999
that have gone out into the world.

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:47.439
The spirit of Antichrist.

00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:49.039
You heard that it shall come.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.839
It's already here.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:56.239
This was written many, many centuries ago.

00:22:56.239 --> 00:22:59.239
We find that the enemy uses

00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:02.599
the false teachers to blind men

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:05.079
from the truth.

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:07.079
Someone said this,

00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:09.479
that the author of much

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:10.759
of the theology books

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:11.559
that are written today

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.039
or many of the theology books

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:13.719
that are written today

00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:15.479
would be Satan himself.

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:17.439
You say, what in the world is that?

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:19.239
That's a shocking statement.

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:21.959
No, because he wants to

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:24.519
send forth that false teaching.

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:26.039
You know, most false teachers,

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:28.199
as you look at the truth

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:28.839
of the Word of God,

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.239
and this is where we get the exposure,

00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:30.919
if you're taking notes,

00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:32.079
number three this morning,

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:34.439
the exposure of false teachers.

00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:35.999
It's given to us here

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:37.319
how we can identify,

00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:39.319
how we can expose the false teachers,

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:41.119
because where they mess up

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.759
is with Jesus.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:44.919
False teaching,

00:23:44.919 --> 00:23:47.439
the consistent point

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:50.639
in which they fail and they miss

00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:52.359
is on the person of Jesus Christ.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:54.039
Why is that?

00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:55.759
Because it makes all the difference.

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:56.879
Do you remember when Jesus

00:23:56.879 --> 00:23:58.039
said to the disciples,

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.519
he's there and he's speaking

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:01.159
to the disciples and he says,

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:04.759
listen, whom do men say that I am?

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:07.479
Peter's the one that stands up,

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.639
and Peter very quickly,

00:24:09.639 --> 00:24:11.119
actually before Peter speaks up,

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:13.719
the disciples, they kind of offer an answer,

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:15.559
and there's many probably that speak up.

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:16.479
They say, well, some think

00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:19.119
you're John the Baptist or Isaiah

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:22.079
or Jeremiah or one of the prophets.

00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:23.319
Can I tell you this morning

00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:25.039
that the false teachers don't care

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:28.119
if you think Jesus is a prophet?

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:28.919
The false teachers,

00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:29.919
they don't care if you think

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:33.279
that that Jesus was a good man.

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.279
Jesus said, who do they say that I am?

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.239
Isaiah, Jeremiah,

00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:44.879
one of the prophets, John the Baptist.

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:48.119
Then Jesus says, but whom say ye that I am?

00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:50.879
And Peter then stands up and says,

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:52.599
thou art the Christ,

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:55.079
the son of the living God,

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.879
the Messiah, the promised one.

00:24:57.879 --> 00:24:59.919
Paul would then later say to those

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:01.359
that he's speaking to in the book of Acts,

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:04.159
how that this Jesus whom I preach is Christ.

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:06.399
They knew who Jesus was as a person,

00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:07.839
but they say he's let them know

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:08.959
that's Messiah.

00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:10.799
He is Christ.

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:13.079
He is God in flesh.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:14.479
And we find this morning

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:16.639
that many of the false teachers,

00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:20.159
these false religious systems,

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.239
these false cults,

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:24.559
they get it wrong on Jesus.

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:26.719
They don't care if you think

00:25:26.719 --> 00:25:28.799
that Jesus was a good teacher.

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:29.799
They don't care if you think

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:31.719
that Jesus was a prophet,

00:25:31.719 --> 00:25:32.399
that he was.

00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:38.239
They care if you believe that Jesus is God.

00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:39.199
And this morning,

00:25:39.199 --> 00:25:40.679
when we look at the text of Scripture

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:42.119
in First John, chapter four,

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:44.039
the exposure of false teachers

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:45.439
is provided for us.

00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:46.679
Notice what the Bible says

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:47.759
in verse number two.

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:49.799
Hereby, no.

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:51.519
Now, remember, we looked at this word

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:53.159
at the end of chapter number three

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:53.959
in verse number 19.

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:55.639
Hereby, it says in hereby,

00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:57.119
we know that we are of the truth.

00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:59.039
And we mentioned this word hereby.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.119
It means by this.

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.679
And we find here again

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:03.279
that we see this word.

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.839
No, God wants us to know.

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:07.719
He doesn't want us to be blinded.

00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:09.199
He doesn't want us to be confused.

00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:10.839
He wants us to know truth.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:11.879
He is truth.

00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:13.479
He's provided us with truth.

00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:15.719
And the Bible says hereby, no.

00:26:15.959 --> 00:26:17.759
Ye, the spirit of God.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.799
Every spirit that confesses

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:24.399
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:25.839
is of God.

00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:29.159
Here's the test that we're going to provide.

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:31.279
Here's the examining,

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:34.279
trying the spirits.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:36.679
He says every spirit

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.839
that confesses that Jesus Christ

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:42.359
has come in the flesh is of God.

00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:44.719
We think about the person of Jesus Christ

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:46.119
and we understand this morning

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:49.079
his incarnation, his deity

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.199
in his work of redemption.

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:53.279
And that's where they get it wrong

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:54.719
on the person of Jesus Christ,

00:26:54.719 --> 00:26:56.079
who he is and why he came,

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:58.079
what he came to do, what he accomplished.

00:26:58.599 --> 00:27:00.759
Listen, it's Christ alone.

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:02.679
It's not Christ plus our works.

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:03.879
That's false teaching.

00:27:03.879 --> 00:27:05.199
It's not Christ plus Mary.

00:27:05.199 --> 00:27:06.599
That's false teaching.

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:08.559
It's Christ alone.

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:09.679
Amen.

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:11.959
And we find here that he says this,

00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:13.719
that this spirit of God

00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:15.839
hereby know ye the spirit of God.

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:17.479
Every spirit that confesses

00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:18.879
that Jesus Christ has come

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:19.839
in the flesh is of God.

00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:21.439
Notice in verse number three,

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.719
he says every spirit that confesses

00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:25.999
not that Jesus Christ

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:29.639
has come in the flesh is not of God.

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:31.879
Pretty plain, is it not?

00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:33.839
Now.

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:37.279
The plainness of the teaching.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:40.279
Is evident through this passage,

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:42.799
the difficulty for us

00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:45.799
on believe not every spirit

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:47.439
and try the spirits

00:27:47.439 --> 00:27:49.519
is the craftiness of the enemy.

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:51.639
That's where it becomes difficult.

00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:54.119
That's why we so desperately need

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:56.639
to depend upon the Holy Spirit of God

00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:58.999
to enable us to understand

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:01.759
these this process

00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:02.959
of trying the spirits.

00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:04.599
That's why it's so imperative

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:06.399
that we know the word of God

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.519
and we're able to run to the scriptures.

00:28:08.679 --> 00:28:10.639
I've had conversations with people,

00:28:10.639 --> 00:28:12.399
countless conversations with people

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:14.759
that have been blinded by false teaching

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.359
that have believed a lie

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:18.439
and they're so convinced of it

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:21.079
because of what they experienced.

00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:22.799
And it's critical

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:24.639
that we as the people of God,

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:26.119
that we depend,

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:28.319
we rely upon the Holy Spirit of God

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:30.519
to guide us into all truth.

00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:32.319
And we go to the word of God

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.279
as the standard.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.239
Listen, your experience

00:28:35.239 --> 00:28:36.279
and my experience

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:38.079
do not trump the word of God.

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:40.799
There are people today,

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:43.079
it's actually extremely popular today

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:44.279
when we look at some of the

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:45.880
Pentecostal movement

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.679
and some of that

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.599
that we find that's so prevalent

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:49.760
in our society today,

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.880
where it's a lot about experience

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.839
and about emotion.

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.359
And here's what I've experienced.

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.279
And by the way,

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:57.320
if you talk to someone

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.599
that's experienced some of those things,

00:28:58.599 --> 00:28:59.880
you're never going to convince them

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.760
that they didn't experience

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.760
what they experienced.

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:03.719
I've tried.

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:06.159
You'll drive yourself crazy.

00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:07.679
Why?

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.959
Because they experienced it.

00:29:10.639 --> 00:29:11.839
Because they experienced it.

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.519
Can I tell you this morning

00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:14.799
that when Cornelius

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.239
received word from God,

00:29:18.239 --> 00:29:19.079
that vision,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.279
that didn't save him.

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:22.799
You know what Cornelius was told?

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.039
Send for Peter

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:25.919
and Peter will tell you.

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.839
Man, that's power.

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:29.359
You go to the word of God.

00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:32.679
I've been to heaven

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:33.399
and I'm going to tell you

00:29:33.399 --> 00:29:34.359
what heaven's all about.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.639
We got people making movies

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.559
and writing books

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.479
and all sorts of things.

00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:38.479
And people listen,

00:29:38.479 --> 00:29:40.839
God's people are buying that stuff

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:41.880
and watching that stuff

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.119
and reading that stuff.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.719
But you know what Paul said

00:29:44.719 --> 00:29:45.399
after he was caught up

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:46.079
to the third heaven?

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:47.880
I'm not permitted to talk about it.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:50.599
So if Paul couldn't talk about it,

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.559
you think some little kid

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.639
is allowed to talk about it?

00:29:53.199 --> 00:29:54.440
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:58.079
God's given us in his word

00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:59.079
what heaven's about,

00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:00.559
what he wants us to know.

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.279
know heaven is about.

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.639
And the things that He's not told us,

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:06.799
obviously we don't need to know.

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.119
Amen?

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:11.559
And listen, this morning when we look at this exposure

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:15.959
of false teachers, the instruction is simple.

00:30:15.959 --> 00:30:19.879
The outworking, the going through the process

00:30:19.879 --> 00:30:21.339
is what becomes difficult, why?

00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:24.199
Because of the craftiness of the enemy.

00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:26.119
Take your Bible and turn to the book of 2 Corinthians

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:27.279
in chapter number 11.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:31.159
I want you to see the craftiness of the enemy

00:30:31.159 --> 00:30:32.979
as God would give us this truth

00:30:32.979 --> 00:30:34.959
in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11.

00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:38.319
And I want you to understand that as the people of God,

00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:41.699
we must take heed to the word of God.

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:45.279
We must understand and take heed to this exhortation

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.239
that starts the passage of scripture

00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:49.039
in 1 John chapter number four.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:52.359
Believe not every spirit, try the spirits.

00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:53.199
Why?

00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:54.779
Why this exhortation?

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:57.539
Because of the existence, there are many false prophets

00:30:57.539 --> 00:30:59.339
that have gone out into the world.

00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:01.939
And how are these false prophets, these false teachers,

00:31:01.939 --> 00:31:03.339
how are they exposed?

00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:06.919
We must depend and rely upon the Holy Spirit of God

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:08.579
to guide us into all truth.

00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:11.540
We must use the word of God, examining the scriptures,

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.259
examining their teaching and their beliefs

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:18.680
and what they peddle according to the word of God.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.839
Notice in 2 Corinthians 11 in verse number 13.

00:31:25.699 --> 00:31:27.540
The Bible says this,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.540
for such are false apostles, deceitful workers,

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:39.139
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:46.979
Notice verse 14, and no marvel,

00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:51.979
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

00:31:55.699 --> 00:31:57.339
So what do we read in verse number 15?

00:31:57.339 --> 00:32:00.720
Therefore, as we understand this truth,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.619
as we understand these false apostles,

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:03.819
these deceitful workers,

00:32:03.819 --> 00:32:06.299
we understand that they've transformed themselves

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.939
into the apostles of Christ.

00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:10.979
We understand this morning that Paul says

00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:13.739
to the believers in Corinth, listen, don't marvel at that,

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:16.979
for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

00:32:16.979 --> 00:32:21.619
Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers

00:32:21.619 --> 00:32:25.619
also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness,

00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:29.339
whose end shall be according to their works.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.139
The craftiness and the deceitfulness, listen,

00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:35.619
I don't know where it originated,

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:40.099
but somebody has depicted that Satan runs around

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:42.020
with a pitchfork and a pointy tail.

00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:45.539
You've seen it depicted that way.

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.259
That's just not Bible.

00:32:48.539 --> 00:32:50.679
Listen, if he always appeared that way,

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:54.039
it'd be easy to identify him, right?

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:58.619
But he transforms himself into an angel of light.

00:32:58.619 --> 00:33:02.679
Oh, this is where it becomes absolutely necessary

00:33:02.679 --> 00:33:04.880
for us as the people of God to take heed

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.800
to this exhortation in 1 John chapter number four,

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.720
believe not every spirit.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.319
You know how many people see some crafty work of the enemy,

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:16.399
some hocus-pocus nonsense that goes on,

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:17.880
and they say, well, they did this.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.599
I had somebody tell me 10 years ago,

00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:20.720
they said, well, pastor,

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.239
I just want you to know about this person.

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:23.440
They called me pastor.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.880
They weren't a member of our church.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.520
They said, pastor, I just want you to know

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.440
that this is what happened.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.599
What do you think about this person?

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:29.720
I said, that's a false teacher.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.020
They named the person by name,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.959
and I said, they're a false teacher.

00:33:32.959 --> 00:33:34.239
Well, I just want you to know

00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:35.839
that there was some person there,

00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:37.239
and it was a healing situation,

00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:40.000
and they had a glass eye,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.940
and that guy touched their forehead, and they could see.

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:45.599
I was like, you believe that?

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:49.199
I mean, that was my, I wasn't trying to be unkind,

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:54.319
but I was astounded at the fact that they believed that.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:57.720
That's what they believed.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.000
You know that many of those healing

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.559
situations that you read of, it's a bunch of nonsense.

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:09.039
Just do a little research.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:12.080
It's nonsense, and by the way,

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.559
if you look in the New Testament,

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:15.080
anytime somebody was healed,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.419
it didn't profit the person that healed them.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.399
Amen?

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:22.119
You look at the faith healers today,

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:23.859
they're living in luxury,

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.119
and if they really had the gift of healing,

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.919
which they don't biblically,

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:31.480
listen, our God still heals,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.299
but he doesn't use faith healers.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.359
Okay, we must understand that this morning,

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:39.440
and if they really had the ability to heal,

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.160
why don't they go and show up at some places

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.239
where people are really sick?

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.679
Why do they turn away the people

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.619
that aren't gonna participate and play their little game,

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:49.500
and then they just put it on them?

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.459
Well, you just don't have enough faith.

00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:56.720
Peter and Paul, you read in the book of Acts,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.980
when they healed, you know what they,

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.540
when they healed, you know why?

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.299
Again, the sign gifts, it would authenticate their message.

00:35:05.299 --> 00:35:07.139
Do you remember, turn back, if you will,

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:11.019
to the book of Acts, and let's look at this passage quickly

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:12.260
in closing this morning.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.220
I want you to look in Acts chapter 28.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.139
In Acts chapter number 28,

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:24.019
they had just been shipwrecked.

00:35:24.019 --> 00:35:27.019
They end up on the island Melita,

00:35:27.019 --> 00:35:28.660
and the Bible tells us that the people there

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.980
showed them kindness, but I want you to pick it up with me

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.679
in verse number three, that Paul was there.

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:34.500
Of course, he was the one that in Acts 27,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.220
he told them not to go, and they went,

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.899
and they had that terrible storm.

00:35:37.899 --> 00:35:38.739
They were shipwrecked.

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:40.419
Paul stood up and said, I believe God,

00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.059
and all that transpired.

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:43.540
They get there to Melita,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.540
and the Bible tells us that Paul, in verse number three,

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.940
gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.119
Notice the end of verse number three,

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:51.700
there came a viper out of the heat

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.739
and fastened onto his hand.

00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:54.660
That's a problem.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.279
That'd be a real problem for me.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:58.320
I'd just have a heart attack, amen?

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.899
I'm just being honest with you.

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:01.220
You say, pastor, you have heart problems?

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.980
Not that I know of, but if I had a viper on me,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.739
I'd have heart problems.

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:08.619
And the Bible says this, notice in verse number four,

00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:11.059
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:14.179
hang on his hand, they said among themselves,

00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:18.339
no doubt this man is a murderer,

00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:20.459
whom though he hath escaped the sea,

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:24.480
yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.019
Paul's a murderer.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.339
That's their conclusion.

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:31.179
But then Paul shakes it off.

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:32.040
Can you imagine?

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.100
It says this in verse number five,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.559
he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm.

00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:41.419
How be it they looked when he should have swollen

00:36:41.419 --> 00:36:43.200
or fallen down dead suddenly,

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.639
but after they had looked a great while

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:46.359
and saw no harm come on him,

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:50.359
they changed their minds and said that he was a God.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.899
In verse number seven, in the same quarters

00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:56.639
were possessions of the chief man of the island,

00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:58.799
whose name was Publius, who received us

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.600
and lodged us three days courteously.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.779
And it came to pass that the father of Publius

00:37:02.779 --> 00:37:04.600
lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.459
to whom Paul entered in and prayed

00:37:06.459 --> 00:37:09.139
and laid his hands on him and healed him.

00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:11.000
Notice the Bible tells us that he healed him.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.619
There were others there in verse number nine

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:14.079
and you notice what's taking place.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:15.779
And I believe with all of my heart,

00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:16.820
as you look at Acts 28,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.859
we don't have all the time to develop it this morning,

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:21.260
but the reason that Paul was able to heal them

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.799
and the reason that God allowed that

00:37:22.799 --> 00:37:25.179
was so that it would authenticate the message

00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:28.720
that he would preach the gospel to these people in Melita

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.320
and they would get saved.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.899
And you read this over and over in the book of Acts.

00:37:33.899 --> 00:37:36.119
Listen, these false teachers that we read of

00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:39.239
as Paul was exposing them in 2 Corinthians 11,

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:41.559
listen, they want to transform themselves

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:43.519
into the ministers of Christ

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:45.660
because listen, it's no small thing.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.000
We should not marvel because Satan himself

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.079
is transformed into an angel of light.

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:52.959
And so we must take heed, we must acknowledge here

00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:57.600
in 2 Corinthians 11 that this takes place.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.720
I talked to a man probably 18 years ago

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.279
and he said, yeah, I know I'm saved.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.279
I said, how do you know you're saved?

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:04.160
That's wonderful, tell me how you got saved.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.239
He said, well, I got home

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:06.359
and I was having a really bad time.

00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:09.200
My wife and I were just dealing with almost getting divorced

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.119
and all this sort of thing

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:12.239
and work was going bad and all these things

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:15.220
and I sat on the corner of my bed after a long day at work

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.239
and as I sat in the corner of my bed, Mary walked in.

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:20.139
I thought Mary was his wife, honestly.

00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:24.380
I was just, it was like 18 years ago.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.639
I could almost take you to the door in Exton, Virginia

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.339
where I was when I knocked on the door of that person.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.239
And he said, Mary walked in.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:40.119
He was speaking of seeing some person, Mary,

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.419
the mother of Jesus is who he was speaking of.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.320
And he said, Mary lifted my hand

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.760
and led me over to the window

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.400
and told me to look out the window.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.919
In all sincerity, he said, come over here.

00:38:53.919 --> 00:38:55.960
He said, I looked out my window and I saw right there

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.960
and there was Jesus and I know I'm saved.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.760
He believed that experience with all of his heart.

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:07.700
He believed it.

00:39:08.559 --> 00:39:10.799
There was nothing I could say to that man on that day

00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:11.719
that would convince him

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:14.099
that he did not experience what he experienced.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.799
But when we understand the whole of scripture,

00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:19.919
we say, listen, no marvel.

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:21.960
For Satan himself transformed himself

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.460
into an angel of light.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:28.460
Listen, Satan will do anything that he is permitted to do

00:39:29.299 --> 00:39:31.460
because he's not God.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.219
Satan will do anything he has permitted to do

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:38.059
to blind people from the truth.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.299
And we find this exposure of false teachers.

00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:43.580
Listen this morning.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.619
It is so imperative for us this morning

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:52.260
to take heed to the exhortation of 1 John 4

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.159
in verse number one.

00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:57.580
Beloved, believe not every spirit.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.380
Don't see them.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:11.020
some hocus-pocus and just, they must be…no, no, believe not every spirit, try the spirits.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:19.620
Examine them, test them, prove them for the purpose to determine whether they're genuine.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:26.840
And we find that as we would rely upon the Holy Spirit of God and how we should rejoice

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:34.040
this morning and thank God this morning that He's given us the Holy Spirit who will lead

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.960
us into all truth.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.120
He will lead you into all truth.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:47.040
And how we should thank God that He's given us a Bible, the whole canon of Scripture,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.960
and we examine Scripture with Scripture.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:56.280
And we say, God, thank You for telling us about the false teachers, but thank You for

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:03.120
instructing us on how we're to deal with false teaching and how we can overcome, defeat false

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120
teaching.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:10.960
Listen, there are certain men crept unawares who turned the grace of God into lasciviousness.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:18.560
There are people, and I don't want to over-exaggerate, you can do some research and I can tell you

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:29.160
some more things, but there are people that willingly take a position of church leadership

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.880
to deceive.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.480
It happens.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.880
There are people that take oaths to do it.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.400
It's insane, but it's the work of the enemy.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.600
And so John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, beloved, believe

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.200
not every spirit.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.200
Try the spirits to see if they're of God.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.720
And he gives us some instruction this morning, oh, I hope that we take heed to the exhortation

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.040
because false teachers still exist.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.160
They're all over the place, but God's exposed them.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.160
Let's pray together.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.640
Father, we love You.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.960
We thank You for loving us.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.320
I thank You for the Word of God.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.279
I thank You for the Holy Spirit of God who indwells us, who is the Spirit of truth, who

00:42:18.279 --> 00:42:23.600
leads us, guides us into all truth.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:33.400
We acknowledge this morning the existence of false teachers, but God, we're thankful

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:43.120
that You've given us this truth for how we can know their tactics, but also have victory

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.400
and not be led astray.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.880
As we mentioned by way of introduction, what we're trying to avoid is that lack of stability,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.040
being tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.860
We want to avoid that.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:05.100
We want to be, as Paul said to the believers in Colossians 1 and 23, we want to be grounded

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.860
and settled, move not away from the truth of the gospel.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.860
And God, I pray that You'd help us.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.220
Help us to be careful with the things that we read.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.980
Help us to be careful with the things that we watch.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:33.020
Help us to be aware of the tactic, the craftiness of the enemy that lies in wait to deceive.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.779
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts as only You can this morning.

00:43:37.779 --> 00:43:43.059
Maybe this morning all of us should come and thank You for Your truth and for the Holy

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:45.620
Spirit of God.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:54.860
Perhaps this morning there's one that's been given ear to false teaching.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.860
They've been deceived.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.340
Oh God, I pray that You'd help them this morning.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:05.460
Help them to follow the exhortation that's given in this passage of Scripture.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:12.779
God, if there's one that's not saved this morning, they've believed a lie of the enemy

00:44:12.779 --> 00:44:15.620
with regard to what salvation really is.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.500
God, I pray that today be the day of their salvation.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.779
Would You move and work as only You can.

00:44:22.779 --> 00:44:26.059
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do in our midst, for it's in Christ's

00:44:26.059 --> 00:44:27.059
name we pray.

00:44:27.059 --> 00:44:28.059
Would You stand with me?

00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:30.140
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.500
The end of each of our services we have a time of invitation, give you an opportunity

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:39.980
to respond as the Holy Spirit of God has used the Word of God in your life this morning.

00:44:40.179 --> 00:44:42.899
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano and the altar is open.

00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:45.820
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.059
for sure that heaven's your home.

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:49.700
Maybe you just want to come and thank God.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.260
Maybe you just want to come this morning and ask God to protect you from false teaching

00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:00.339
that's so prevalent in our society today, and help you to follow the admonition that's

00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:02.339
been given, the exhortation.

00:45:02.339 --> 00:45:04.179
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
