1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
this evening, the book of Nehemiah.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,400
We'll be looking at Nehemiah chapter number two

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,880
and we're gonna reference some things from the first chapter before we get

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,760
into the message this evening.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,800
Nehemiah chapter two verses eleven through twenty will be the text for the

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,639
service this evening.

7
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:21,079
I just want to mention just a few background points with regard to this

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,479
book of Nehemiah. Some of you might be familiar with it, but Nehemiah is the

9
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,479
cupbearer

10
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,600
to Artaxerxes. He's living

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,360
post-captivity. And so what do we mean by that? Well,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,040
of course you know that the nation of Israel

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,000
was taken captive by the Assyrians because of their wickedness, their

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,200
idolatry, their sin, and God's judgment came upon them.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,259
And then shortly thereafter we find that Judah was taken captive into Babylon.

16
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,240
That Babylonian captivity as prophesied by Jeremiah would last for seventy

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,360
years.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,799
And of course Daniel as he was reading Jeremiah's prophecies and he understands

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,200
the fulfillment of those seventy years and

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,919
there's a remnant that was then permitted to return back to Jerusalem.

21
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:11,319
So Nehemiah in Nehemiah chapter number one, he's not in Jerusalem, but he's

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,959
inquired with regard to what's taking place

23
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,040
in the city of Jerusalem with the people of God.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,839
And he is living there as the cupbearer again for Artaxerxes the king,

25
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:28,120
but he's living post-captivity. We find that the report is provided, if you

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
notice in chapter one,

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,120
the Bible says in verse number two

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,800
that Hanani, one of my brethren, came,

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,000
he and certain men of Judah, and I asked them

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,559
concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and

31
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,879
concerning Jerusalem. And so you find

32
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,639
that Nehemiah was concerned enough to ask, to inquire, ask to the condition

33
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:52,480
not only of the people but also of the city. And he was burdened, he was

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
interested in knowing,

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,919
and it says that he asked them, and it says to us in verse number three, and

36
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,879
they said unto me,

37
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,760
and this is where Nehemiah receives the report, he

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,919
is given a report and it says this, that the remnant that are left of the

39
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,080
captivity there in the province

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,839
notice are in great affliction and reproach.

41
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:19,759
The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned

42
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,520
with fire.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,600
It's no good report that Nehemiah receives and we find that this report

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,440
that is provided to Nehemiah has an impact and the impact is serious.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,479
We find that Nehemiah is broken over the condition of what he hears and

46
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,559
that brokenness, however, leads him to a closer walk with the Lord.

47
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:46,399
There's a message all in of itself of that particular truth because we find

48
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,440
that his response to hearing this awful report

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,479
was that it says this in verse number four,

50
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,360
and it came to pass when I heard these words

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,880
that I sat down, notice, and wept and mourned certain days,

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,440
but then he says this, and fasted and prayed before the God

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,559
of heaven.

54
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:09,160
He was broken over what he had heard of the

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,679
report that was received, but that brokenness led him to a closer walk with

56
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,679
the Lord.

57
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,759
There's no doubt in my life, again it's not really the message this evening,

58
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,839
there's no doubt in my mind, however,

59
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,160
that there are times in which we will face circumstances and situations in

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,279
our lives

61
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:29,639
that may lead us to a place of brokenness, but that brokenness must lead

62
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,399
us

63
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,960
to a closer walk with the Lord.

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,479
It must not allow, we must not allow for some circumstances to cause there to be

65
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,639
a wedge or divide between me and my Savior,

66
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,520
and that my brokenness causes me to be full of despair and

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,919
to lose hope. Know that I draw nigh unto God, that I draw closer

68
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,880
to Him.

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,679
We find that he prays, and after he prays we find that he, once again, if you

70
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:59,880
enter into the second chapter, and really we'll be looking at verse number

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,039
eleven and going forward from there,

72
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,279
but we find that eventually, after he prays and seeks the Lord,

73
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:10,720
that he has an interaction with the king, with Artaxerxes, it's recorded for us in

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
the beginning of chapter number two,

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,640
we find that in that interaction the king had not seen

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,040
Nehemiah sad at any other time in his presence.

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,480
And the king, according to verse number two, said this is nothing more than sorrow

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,000
of heart.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,359
In this situation, the circumstance had been

80
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,839
laying heavy on the heart of Nehemiah, and we find that Nehemiah,

81
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,119
he makes this request in verse number four, the Bible says, the king said unto me,

82
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,440
For what dost thou make request?

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,679
Notice the Bible says, So I prayed to the God of heaven, and I said unto the king,

84
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:50,799
If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight,

85
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:55,679
that thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of my father's sepulchres,

86
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,640
that I may build it.

87
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,239
We find that that's the request that Nehemiah has, and as we

88
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:06,519
come to our text this evening, picking it up in verse number eleven,

89
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,679
we find that our text is going to pick up the account

90
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:14,839
at the time in which he's arrived in the city, and the Bible tells us that he was

91
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,399
there for three days.

92
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,760
Notice in verse eleven, the Bible says, So I came to Jerusalem,

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,040
and was there three days, and I rose in the night.

94
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,799
I and some few men with me, neither told I any man what my God

95
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,519
had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem.

96
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,040
Neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon,

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,720
and I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well,

98
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,239
and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

99
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:49,440
which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,480
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, to the king's pool,

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,119
but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,679
Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back,

103
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:06,760
and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,480
We'll continue reading through verse number 20 as we get through the message

105
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,559
this evening, but I want you to notice a phrase in verse number 12,

106
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,760
and I've used this phrase really for the sermon this evening.

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,679
Notice the Bible says, and I arose in the night, in verse number 12,

108
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,480
I and some few men with me, and then it says this,

109
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:29,480
neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem.

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,320
For the next few moments, I want to preach a message that I've simply entitled,

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,220
When God Puts Something in Your Heart.

112
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,760
We find that it's revealed in verse number five of the text of scripture,

113
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,720
as he's speaking to Artaxerxes, that he had this desire,

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,160
that he would receive permission to leave his place of responsibility,

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,640
to go to Judah, to go to Jerusalem specifically, that he might build it.

116
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,359
And we find that he is granted permission, he arrives in Jerusalem,

117
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:01,440
according to verse number 11, and he's there for three days.

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,799
The Bible goes on to give us an account that I think is so powerful,

119
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:10,239
and so applicable for us this evening, when we consider the work of God

120
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,920
that must be accomplished.

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm so thankful to be part of the greatest work in all the world.

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,440
I preached a message earlier in the month of December,

123
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,399
with regard to really that thought of being involved in the work of the ministry.

124
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,799
The message was from the end of 2 Timothy chapter number four,

125
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,799
when the Bible says about Mark,

126
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,119
bring him, why?

127
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,920
For he is profitable to me for the ministry.

128
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,440
And I mentioned about being profitable for the ministry,

129
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,320
and what a blessing it is to be involved in the ministry and the work of God.

130
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,200
And we find here in Nehemiah chapter two, that God put something in Nehemiah's heart.

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,760
As we look at the text of scripture, I want you to consider with me,

132
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,359
number one, the reconnaissance of Nehemiah.

133
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,679
In verses 11 through 15, we find that Nehemiah,

134
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:58,200
there's really a reconnaissance type mission that takes place, if you will.

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,239
I've read the verses of scripture.

136
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:05,559
But we find that as we look at verses 12 through 15, as Nehemiah goes out,

137
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,839
the Bible says, I arose in the night in verse number 12.

138
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,640
He says he took a few men with him.

139
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
There was no beast, according to the end of the verse with me,

140
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,040
save the beast that I wrote upon.

141
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,679
And notice in verse number 13, it says,

142
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,320
and I went out by night by the gate of the valley,

143
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
even before the dragon well into the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,

144
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,720
which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,719
He left from that place and he went onto the gate of the fountain and the king's pool.

146
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
But there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

147
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,320
And then in verse 15, he went up in the night by the brook

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,000
and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,239
And as Nehemiah goes out on this particular mission,

150
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,679
on this reconnaissance mission, if you will,

151
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,440
I believe that Nehemiah is now seeing with his own eyes

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,840
what he had previously only been told about.

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,640
He had received a report according to chapter number one.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,960
And the report, as I read a moment ago,

155
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,840
was that the people were in great affliction and reproach

156
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,559
and that the wall of Jerusalem was broken down

157
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,919
and the gates thereof are burned with fire.

158
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,000
But now on this night, after the three days of being in Jerusalem,

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,440
as Nehemiah and a few men go out,

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,200
we find that he now is seeing with his own eyes the condition.

161
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm beginning to think about the truth of Lamentations 3.

162
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,960
And perhaps if you have your Bibles,

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,320
turn over there to Lamentations chapter 3 very quickly.

164
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,320
And I want to remind you of a verse of Scripture in Lamentations,

165
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,039
Jeremiah Lamentations, and look at Lamentations chapter 3.

166
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,039
And I want you to notice what the Bible says in verse number 51.

167
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,919
Lamentations 3 in verse number 51, the Bible says this,

168
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,880
Mine eye affecteth...

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,080
my heart, because of all the daughters of my city." You know there's something about

170
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,760
seeing for yourself. There's something about what passes through your eye gate

171
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,680
when you see that. It's one thing to read a report from a missionary, it's one

172
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,960
thing to to hear on a Wednesday evening an update from a missionary, it's one

173
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,040
thing to hear the pastor stand in the pulpit week after week and talk about a

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,320
need in our region to reach our region with the gospel and then to go from here

175
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,720
out to the world to reach the world with the gospel. It's one thing to hear

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,000
someone give a testimony of, I was out talking to people and sharing the

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
gospel with people and I was knocking on doors and here's, it's a whole nother

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,480
thing to go out and experience it yourself. And to truly see the need, to

179
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,560
see it with your own eyes, to see the condition of the of the world, to see

180
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,560
the need of those around us. We understand that their greatest need is

181
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,680
the need of salvation and we understand that we have the answer. In fact this

182
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,040
afternoon I was in the office for just a short period of time this afternoon

183
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,320
before the service and I was reading some things and one of the things that I

184
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,760
read said this, it said that God's plan to reach this generation with the

185
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:29,160
gospel is us. Absolutely. There are no more Spurgeons, there are no more Moody's. We

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,800
can talk about them. Paul is with the Lord and has been for centuries. Amen. But

187
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,560
we find that Nehemiah, he cared enough to ask but then God put something in his

188
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,800
heart. And as God put something in his heart we find that Nehemiah goes to

189
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,760
Jerusalem and after having the permission to leave from his place of

190
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,240
responsibility in the palace as the cupbearer to Artaxerxes, we find that he

191
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,880
arrives there in Jerusalem and what does he do before he tells anybody what God

192
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,200
has put in his heart? He goes out and he sees it with his own eyes. You know why I

193
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,440
think that is? Because he would then have the ability to communicate much

194
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,200
more effectively after seeing it with his own eyes. He would have more of a

195
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,880
fire burning in his soul after seeing it with his own eyes. You don't believe me?

196
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,240
Think about the the report that we received at the end of the month of

197
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,840
September after we returned from the missions trip to Panama. Those eleven

198
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,720
people that came back, we had the privilege of being there and we came

199
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
back and we gave testimonies that evening and you know it was interesting

200
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,559
to hear the individual stand and give testimonies about what they saw, what

201
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,919
they experienced personally as they were there in Panama. There's something about

202
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,800
seeing it that does something in your heart, does something in your soul.

203
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,320
Nehemiah had heard but now he sees. We see the reconnaissance of Nehemiah. I want

204
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,520
you to notice in verses 16 and 17, number two, the request of Nehemiah. We find

205
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,440
that the Bible says in verse 16, and the rulers knew not whither I went or what I

206
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,120
did, neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the

207
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,440
nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. Then said I unto

208
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,600
them, notice what he says, ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem

209
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,600
lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire. Come and let us build

210
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,840
up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach. The reality is that the

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,200
individuals that Nehemiah is speaking to in verses 16 and 17, they were the ones

212
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,639
that lived there, they were the ones that had gotten used to the condition of

213
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,360
the city, they were the ones that had week after week and had gone through and

214
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,080
they'd seen that the walls were broken down, they'd seen that the the gates

215
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,800
were burned with fire, they knew that they were reproach and they they just

216
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,119
kind of got used to it. You ever think about that? Just kind of getting used to it.

217
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:23,440
We get to the place where we're just almost not affected anymore. But he says

218
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,320
to these individuals that had been living there, these individuals that

219
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,279
knew it, he says to them, ye see the distress that we are in. This was

220
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,559
nothing new for them, this was not their first pass. It was Nehemiah's first time

221
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,399
that his eyes are beholding the condition of the city, but it is not the

222
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,040
first time for these individuals. They had been there, they had lived it, and

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,920
they had grown, I believe, calloused to the situation. And the Bible says

224
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,440
something very interesting at the end of verse number 17. Notice what he says,

225
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:09,839
come and let, what does it say? Us. Come and let us build up the wall of

226
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:18,920
Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach. I begin to think about this request of

227
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,360
Nehemiah, and he says us, and he says we, and this is speaking in the plural and

228
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,559
understanding that this is a work, listen, this work was too big for Nehemiah. He

229
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,000
could not on his own, with his own resources and his own strength, he could

230
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,279
not accomplish what they together could accomplish. And therefore he says, come

231
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:49,480
and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach.

232
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,399
God put something in the heart of Nehemiah, but he was gonna need the help

233
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,760
of others. This was some great task, and he mentions in other portions of this

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,959
book of Nehemiah, in fact in chapter 6, hold your place there in chapter 2, but

235
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,399
go over to chapter 6 and look at verse 3, and notice as these messengers came

236
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,279
to him and besought him to go and have this meeting in one of the villages in

237
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,320
the plain of Ono. In verse number 3 we find that he, Nehemiah, sent messengers

238
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,720
unto them, and notice what he says, I am doing a great work so that I cannot come

239
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,080
down. Why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you? Listen, he

240
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:35,559
understood that it was a great work, he understood that this task, the work, the

241
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,920
burden that God had placed in his heart was beyond his ability to accomplish in

242
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,880
and of himself, but he says, let us, that we be no more a reproach. And Nehemiah is

243
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,480
making this request, I want you to consider the truth of being co-laborers

244
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,720
with the Lord. Notice over in the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will, look at some

245
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,480
New Testament principles, and look in the book of 1 Corinthians, and we'll look at

246
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,559
2 Corinthians as well, and as you're turning there, I just want to remind you

247
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,399
in there, in Luke chapter number 5, I don't need you to turn there, but when

248
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:14,239
God told them to, told Peter to cast out into the deep, launch out into the deep,

249
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,320
let down your nets for a draft of fishes, we find that it's interesting, you know

250
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,880
what he did? He called, he beckoned to his partners. You know what he said? Come and

251
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
help us. And we come here to the book of 1 Corinthians in chapter number 3,

252
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
and I want you to notice, as Paul is writing to these believers in Corinth,

253
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
these individuals that he mentions that they're carnal, because they're saying,

254
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,679
I'm of Paul, I'm of Apollos, and so on and so forth, but notice what he says in

255
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,760
verse number 5 of 1 Corinthians 3, who then is Paul and who is Apollos? But

256
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,920
ministers, by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man, I have

257
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,239
planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. Continue reading and look

258
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,480
in verse 7, the Bible says, so then neither is he that planteth anything,

259
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,679
neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase. Now he that planteth

260
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:13,679
and he that watereth, what does it say? Are one. They're one. And every man shall

261
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,239
receive in his own reward according to his own labor, and then notice this in

262
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:26,360
verse number 9, for we are laborers together with God. Ye are God's husbandry,

263
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,119
ye are God's building, and notice as he says in verse number 9, we are laborers

264
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:37,400
together with God. Every word is specifically chosen. I'm thankful that

265
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,760
all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and we believe in the verbal

266
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,479
plenary inspiration that every word of God is pure. And here's what God

267
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:52,640
says. He says, we are, that's the believers, the Christians, we are laborers

268
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:02,720
together, not for God, but with God. We are laborers together with God. And we

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,840
find that Nehemiah, as he goes and he sees with his own eyes what he'd only

270
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,799
previously heard with his ears, and God had put this thing in his heart, but

271
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,599
before he could let any man know what God had put in his heart, he had to go

272
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,799
out and see it for himself. And after he sees it, he makes this request, and he

273
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,520
says, come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a

274
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,679
reproach. And I'm reminded this evening about the importance of being co-laborers,

275
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,200
being laborers together with God. And I'm thankful that God would use us, that God

276
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:45,280
would allow us to serve him, and that God would equip us and strengthen us and

277
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,039
and use us for his honor and for his glory. But we understand that what we

278
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,679
could accomplish as a collective group is so much greater than what any one of

279
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,640
us could accomplish in of ourselves.

280
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,540
What we can accomplish as we're laboring together with God far exceeds what we could ever imagine

281
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,260
being accomplished in of our own strength.

282
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,520
We find that Paul then says to the believers here in Corinth, look in 2 Corinthians chapter

283
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,100
number 6 as he continues to really hammer this thought down with this church in Corinth

284
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,360
and understanding the position that we have and the great joy that we have in serving

285
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,600
the Lord.

286
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,440
2 Corinthians 6 and verse number 1, we then, notice what he says, as workers together with

287
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,800
him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.

288
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,000
In several months I'll be preaching from this particular text of scripture on Sunday morning

289
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,600
as we make our way through the book of 2 Corinthians, but understand with me as we look at this

290
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,080
tonight as making reference from this passage in the book of Nehemiah that what Paul is

291
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,760
again reiterating to the believers in Corinth is that we're workers together with God, but

292
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,920
he says this, he says we then as workers together with him, beseech you also, notice that you

293
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,880
receive not the grace of God, what's he say?

294
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,120
In vain.

295
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,960
God's grace, we talk about God's grace and God's grace is so precious and so important

296
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,560
to understand, but when we think of God's grace in this particular context, he's not

297
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,800
talking about God's saving grace, he's talking about God's enabling grace, and that we would

298
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,760
be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

299
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,960
See, God saved us by grace, but then he gives us grace to serve him, he enables us to do

300
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,400
the work as we are workers together with him, and Paul says that we receive not the grace

301
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
of God in vain.

302
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,960
That means that some could be guilty of receiving the grace of God, that enabling, in vain.

303
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
How does that work?

304
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Well, they're not being good stewards of the manifold grace of God, they're not using the

305
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,080
equipping that God has given for the honor and glory of God himself.

306
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,280
And so we find that as this man Nehemiah comes to Jerusalem, can you imagine as these people

307
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,840
had been living there, and Nehemiah comes in, and Nehemiah all of a sudden he just goes

308
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,280
out and he's riding around, he's taking a look at the city, and he gathers these people

309
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,520
together and he says, come, let us build up the wall of Jerusalem.

310
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
I'm sure there were some that wondered, what in the world, you're just new here, I mean

311
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
don't you know what's going on here?

312
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't you know that it's not possible?

313
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't you know?

314
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,280
There's always some, there's always some.

315
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:01,520
The reality is that Nehemiah had something in his heart that came from God.

316
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
God put something in his heart.

317
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:14,080
And what God put in his heart was to build up the wall, but he needed the help of others.

318
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,240
And so he made the request, notice with me the response of the people, number three,

319
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,280
if you're taking notes tonight, look at the response of the people.

320
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,240
I will say this, I am overjoyed as you read the recorded response that is given to us

321
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,600
in verse 18, the Bible says, then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon

322
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
me.

323
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,380
It begins to share with them what God has been doing in his life, and maybe if you go

324
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,000
back to the chapter two, or earlier in the chapters I mentioned that he makes that request

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
in verse five to the king Artaxerxes that I may build it, and the king said unto me

326
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,600
in verse number six, the queen also sitting by him, for how long shall I journey be and

327
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,880
when wilt thou return?

328
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,960
So it pleased the king to send me, and I said unto him, a time.

329
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,100
Moreover I said unto the king, if it pleased the king, let letters be given me to the governors

330
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,440
beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come unto Judah, and a letter

331
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
unto Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for

332
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
the gates of the palace, which appertain to the house and for the wall of the city, and

333
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,360
for the house that I shall enter into, and the king granted me notice according to the

334
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,640
good hand of my God upon me.

335
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,160
Nehemiah was operating here not with a lack of faith, but following the leadership of

336
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,000
God in his life, and he made the request to the king for these letters that would help

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,480
him to easily travel from where he was located to Jerusalem, but also recognizing that he

338
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,680
would need some supplies and said, can I get a letter to be able to get the supplies

339
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,080
as well, and the Bible says that the king granted these letters to him, but notice what

340
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,400
Nehemiah acknowledges, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

341
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,460
God uses people.

342
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,480
God uses people.

343
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,520
God could do whatever he wants to do on his own.

344
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,700
He's God.

345
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,140
But God has chosen to use his people.

346
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:30,140
And we find that God will put something into the hearts of his people, and God will enable

347
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,740
us to do the work that he's called us to do.

348
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:41,620
And we find that Nehemiah, as he's received these letters, it says in verse 9, then I

349
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,180
came to the governors beyond the river, and what did he do?

350
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,940
I gave them the king's letters.

351
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,460
Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.

352
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,300
When Sanballat, the Hornite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite heard of it, it grieved

353
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,900
them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

354
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,780
But God's hand was good upon Nehemiah.

355
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:10,260
And Nehemiah made this request, and as we read the response in verse 18, we're told

356
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,780
that Nehemiah, even still before they're able to respond, he lets them know of how God was

357
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,020
at work and what God was doing and how God was orchestrating these events and how God

358
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,180
was showing his hand mighty.

359
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,700
And the Bible says this, then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon

360
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,540
me, verse 18, as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.

361
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,820
And they said, here's the response of the people, hallelujah for this response, let

362
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,020
us rise up and build.

363
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,340
Let us rise up and build.

364
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,180
He says, come, let us build up the wall.

365
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,780
And they respond and they say, let us rise up and build.

366
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,900
They needed a man that had vision, they needed a man that had something in his heart that

367
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,260
God gave him to do to provide leadership and direction and to give them a cause and to

368
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,660
help them understand that we are working together and we're seeking to accomplish what God has

369
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:19,620
set us out to accomplish and they respond with this positive response of let us rise

370
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,860
up and build.

371
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:28,340
And then notice the end of verse 18, so they strengthened their hands for this good work.

372
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,020
Can I submit to you this evening that this work that they were about to embark upon,

373
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,020
this work that they were going to put their hand to was not a work of ease, it was not

374
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,980
a work of comfort, it was not a work that was without any issues, it was a work that

375
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:50,500
was laborious, it was a work that was exhausting and we find that they said, let us rise up

376
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,380
and build, so they strengthened their hands for this good work.

377
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,860
Could they have provided excuse, I'm sure they could.

378
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,100
Could they have come up with maybe what some would say would be a valid excuse, I'm sure

379
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
some could.

380
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,460
But they said, let us rise, let us rise up and build.

381
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,140
The Bible tells us later that the people had a mind to work.

382
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:26,420
They responded in such a positive way, they could not, what they could not accomplish

383
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,780
individually they now would be able to accomplish together as co-laborers.

384
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:39,020
We understand that this great work that God gave them to do, that they would have the

385
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,179
opportunity to see God work in an amazing way.

386
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,940
In fact, we mentioned earlier about chapter six and all that was going on, turn back there

387
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,179
again if you will to chapter six and in verse number 15, the Bible tells us this wonderful

388
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,739
truth, so the wall, what does it say in your Bible?

389
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,739
Was what?

390
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,739
Finished.

391
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,739
What does that mean?

392
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:05,179
It means the work was accomplished.

393
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:11,700
It means the work that they were enlisted to engage in in verse 17 of chapter two, come

394
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,140
and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more reproached.

395
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,100
The people said, let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good

396
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:28,100
work and the Bible says so the wall in Nehemiah six and verse 15 was finished in the twenty

397
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,260
and fifth day of the month Elul in fifty and two days.

398
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,580
What an accomplishment.

399
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,820
That's what God can do.

400
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,780
That's what God can do.

401
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,660
Nehemiah could never do that.

402
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,660
But when the people of God come together and are laboring together with God, God provided

403
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,940
them with strength, God provided them with wisdom and they were able to accomplish a

404
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,859
great work.

405
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:00,700
Notice in verse 16.

406
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,460
16 of chapter 6, the Bible says in it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof

407
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,940
and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in

408
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,380
their own eyes, notice, for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

409
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:23,100
You know, God has not called us to build a wall, but God's called us to do a work.

410
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,180
God's called us to do a work, and the work is not building a wall, but the work is propagating

411
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,300
the truth of the gospel.

412
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,300
The work that we're called to be involved in and engaged in is a work that requires

413
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:46,160
us to go in the power of God, to go together in boldness and understanding that we're seeking

414
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:53,740
to take a message to a lost and dying world, and we must come to this place where we recognize

415
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,740
that it is our responsibility and we respond by saying, as Isaiah did in Isaiah 6, here

416
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,860
am I, send me.

417
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,300
It doesn't mean that we'd have to cross an ocean, it doesn't mean that we'd have to learn

418
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,260
a new language, a new culture, it simply means that we may have to cross a street and actively

419
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,860
be engaged in trying to reach someone with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

420
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,740
I made this comment recently, I don't remember if it was on a Sunday morning or evening,

421
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,900
but just in the last couple of weeks I made the comment, and I don't make the comment

422
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,860
to be unkind to anyone, but just as God placed it upon my heart and challenged me with this

423
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,500
thought, is this, it's not within me.

424
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,140
We read the text already in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, I can't save anybody and you can't

425
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,260
save anybody.

426
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,260
It is God who gives the increase, amen?

427
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,300
We believe that.

428
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,020
But here's how God has challenged me and how I hope that God would challenge you as well,

429
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,020
is not, when was the last time somebody, I had the privilege of leading somebody to Christ

430
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,500
because God gives the increase, but the question really is this, when is the last time I've

431
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,060
even shared the gospel with someone?

432
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,620
Because that is something that is my responsibility.

433
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,860
Could I say tonight, that's something that is your responsibility, to share the gospel.

434
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,500
I can't save anybody, you can't save anybody, but I sure can tell somebody about Jesus.

435
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:29,260
Some plant, some water, but God gives the increase.

436
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,180
And we are laborers together with God.

437
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,220
And we find here that the response of the people was so appropriate with regard to the

438
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,460
request that was made, and they say, let us rise up and build.

439
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,420
You say, man, it's wonderful, but it's not the end of the chapter, it's not the end of

440
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,820
the chapter.

441
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:59,460
There's one final point this evening, and that's this, number four, the resistance faced.

442
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,100
You know, when there's a response like we read in verse 18, when there's a request like

443
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,580
we see in verse 17, when God has put something in your heart like we see God putting in the

444
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,860
heart of Nehemiah to go and do this work, to be engaged in what God has burdened him

445
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,500
with, and the way that God's hand was upon him, the good hand of my God upon me, and

446
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,100
as he received the letters and he had all of the resources and all of these things,

447
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,900
and we find that Nehemiah comes to a place and he says, I'm doing what God's called me

448
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,340
to do, and the people say, let us rise up and build, then everything should just go

449
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,340
smooth.

450
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,820
Have you found that it doesn't work that way?

451
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,740
There's resistance that the people of God face.

452
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,820
The Bible says in verse 19, but when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Servant, the Ammonite,

453
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:59,060
and Geshem, excuse me, the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised us,

454
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,980
and said, what is this thing that you do?

455
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,800
Will ye rebel against the king?

456
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,560
So we find that the resistance really starts out kind of light.

457
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,080
It will intensify if you study the book of Nehemiah and you continue to go through and

458
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,360
you see the resistance, in fact, in chapter number four in particular, you see how the

459
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,480
enemy mocks and how they threaten and all that they do and they come and they seek to

460
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,640
destroy and all that's taking place and we could not have the time this evening to read

461
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,160
through the fourth chapter of the book of Nehemiah, but I would encourage you to go

462
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,840
back later and read through it because you see this mocking, if you will, this little

463
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,120
ridicule in chapter number two in verse 19 is light compared to what will be faced.

464
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,040
In fact, when you get to chapter number six and we read already about him saying, Nehemiah

465
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,120
saying, no, I'm not going to go because I'm doing a great work, not only did they send

466
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,400
those letters to try to pull him away so that they might deal with him, but we find that

467
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,840
then they lied and they said to Nehemiah that he should go hide himself in the temple

468
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,040
which was not appropriate so that they can bring accusation against him.

469
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,760
Listen, the enemy is deceitful.

470
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,180
The enemy is relentless.

471
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:28,279
We see the resistance faced and here when we look in verse 19, it's just the fact that

472
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,480
the Bible tells us that they laughed at them.

473
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,200
Well, that's not too bad.

474
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,840
Well, you don't like being laughed at, am I right?

475
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,600
I'm going to set out to do this and somebody laughs at you and says, good luck, it's not

476
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,240
going to happen.

477
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,460
Never going to work.

478
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,800
It's discouraging.

479
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,400
You know, discouragement is a tool that's in Satan's toolbox that he uses over and over

480
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,600
and over again, the tool of discouragement.

481
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:09,680
You know, sometimes he'll use even well-intentioned people to discourage you.

482
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,920
That can't be done.

483
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,920
You can't do that.

484
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,640
The Bible says that they despised us.

485
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,760
What is this thing that you do?

486
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,040
Will ye rebel against the king?

487
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,580
Later on in chapter 4, they talk about even if they were to do the work that even if I

488
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,420
fox would run upon it, in verse number 3, even that which they build, if a fox go up,

489
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,580
he shall even break down their stone wall.

490
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:47,820
But notice the response in verse number 20, we'll always have adversity.

491
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,860
We will always face resistance.

492
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,700
When you seek to do a work for God, you can just guarantee there's going to be resistance

493
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,860
because we have an enemy who hates advancement.

494
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,260
He hates it when we seek to do the will of God.

495
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,820
You know, he doesn't mess with you when you're just sitting on the sideline and just not

496
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,460
really doing anything.

497
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,300
You start trying to do something, and here's what happens in your mind.

498
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,700
You say, well, I'm trying to do something for God and all these things have happened.

499
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
Yeah, that's how it works.

500
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,380
That's how it works.

501
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,100
Because that's when the enemy notices you and says, oh, I got to deal with this.

502
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
I got to discourage them.

503
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I got to stop them.

504
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Why?

505
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Because they're trying to do something for God.

506
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,420
And we cannot focus on the resistance, no.

507
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:43,059
We must take note of how Nehemiah answered this resistance that first came in verse 19.

508
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:46,860
In verse 20, the Bible says, then answered I them.

509
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,779
Notice what Nehemiah said.

510
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:55,620
The God of heaven, he will prosper us.

511
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,500
You see that as a statement of faith, confidence?

512
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:06,420
I mean, we find that it says, therefore, we his servants will arise and build, but you

513
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,620
have no portion, nor rite, nor memorial in Jerusalem.

514
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,540
Man, that's wonderful to see the resolve.

515
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,380
See, God put something in his heart.

516
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,820
He said, I'm not going to focus on the resistance.

517
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,140
I'm just going to let you know that our God is going to prosper us and that we are going

518
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,059
to do what God has called us to do.

519
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:33,460
It's interesting when you read chapter 3, and I'll finish with this, that you go through

520
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,619
the work being assigned and the text gives us all of these individuals that we're building

521
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,580
at particular gates and what have you.

522
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,380
But I just want to note one statement in verse number 5.

523
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,820
The Bible says, next unto them the Techoites repaired, but notice this, their nobles put

524
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:00,059
not their necks to the work of their Lord.

525
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:09,540
Could I say to you this evening that the resistance is always going to be faced, but we must refuse

526
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,700
to be on the sidelines.

527
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:19,460
We must get in the work, be engaged in doing the work that God has called us to do.

528
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,260
There's a work to do, not building a wall, I've said that already this evening, but in

529
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
reaching a community.

530
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,820
Listen, I believe the hour is late.

531
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,260
I really do.

532
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,820
The hour is late.

533
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,059
There's much to be accomplished.

534
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,540
People are dying every day.

535
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,900
Many of those people that are dying every day are dying without even knowing the truth

536
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,380
of the gospel.

537
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,739
I mean they're dying without knowing the truth of the gospel.

538
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:51,820
I'm talking about your neighbors and my neighbors.

539
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,419
I'm talking about your coworkers.

540
00:39:53,419 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm talking about people that we interact with in our community.

541
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,739
There's a work to do.

542
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:07,279
that needs to be done. There will be resistance. But I hope that our response would be that

543
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:13,559
of what we read of these people as they responded to Nehemiah and said, let us rise up. Let

544
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:20,399
us do the work that God has called us to do. God put us in this place for a purpose, for

545
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:30,639
a reason. And that reason, first and foremost, is that he would receive glory. He says in

546
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:38,959
John 15, herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. That you bear much fruit.

547
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:46,119
All that God would use us as being laborers together with him, laboring in his vineyard,

548
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,759
doing his work, being used to bring honor and glory to the name of the Lord. Let's pray

549
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:56,999
together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege

550
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:02,159
of looking at this Old Testament passage of scripture and seeing what you put in Nehemiah's

551
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:08,279
heart. Lord, the work that you did there, Lord, we rejoice in it. I pray God that you'd

552
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:18,639
put something in our hearts tonight. Give us a burden. Lord, help us to rise up together

553
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:26,839
as being laborers together with you. To accomplish, Lord, what you've called us to accomplish.

554
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:34,399
To reach our Jerusalem with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray God that you'd

555
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:39,359
move in hearts and lives. Lord, help us to be responsive this evening. Help us to be

556
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,879
doers of the word and not hearers only. We'll thank you for what you'll do, for it's in

557
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,119
Christ's name we pray.
