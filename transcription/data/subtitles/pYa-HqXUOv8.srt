1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,759
number four this evening.

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:03,119
I mentioned this morning,

3
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:07,880
and you see it on the back of your bulletin today as well,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,560
that this is going to be part one.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,000
I think we're gonna be three weeks.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,880
It might be four.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,039
It just depends on how well you listen.

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,520
And no, just kidding,

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,120
how quickly I can get through the material.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,979
I really don't wanna rush through this.

11
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,440
I think it's so important,

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,360
the subject matter that we're gonna deal with

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,319
over these next three or four weeks,

14
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,440
depending on how the Lord leads

15
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,239
and how much we're able to get through.

16
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,040
But the reality is that when we look

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,319
at this passage of scripture,

18
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm not gonna deal really with the content of the miracle

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,000
and all the things that take place and what have you.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,360
But I really want you to see,

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,680
if you were to look in Luke's gospel,

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,040
you can see a great event that takes place.

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,119
But here in Matthew chapter four,

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,240
I want you to notice in verse 19,

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,279
we're just gonna use this single verse of scripture

26
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:53,080
and kind of use it as a springboard

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,400
and go forth throughout the scriptures this evening

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,959
and really kind of lay a foundation, if you will.

29
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,479
Jesus says unto them, it says,

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,319
and he saith unto them, so Jesus is speaking.

31
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:06,519
He's talking to Peter and Andrew, his brother.

32
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,199
And it says this, follow me,

33
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:14,199
and I will make thee, make you fishers of men.

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,000
And of course, we know that by trade, by occupation,

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
they were fishermen.

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,000
In fact, you will find that as they were

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,919
giving the instruction throughout their lives

38
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,480
and with regard to the fish and all that they did,

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,680
we find that even as you think about this occupation

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,400
that they had, now Jesus, knowing their occupation,

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,720
knowing who they are, he says,

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,879
I'm gonna make you fishers of men.

43
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,639
And what a great term that Jesus uses.

44
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,040
They were catching fish for business purposes,

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,360
for obviously a source of food

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,720
and also to provide for themselves and their families

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,000
through an enterprise of selling and trading

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,319
and so on and so forth.

49
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,680
But now the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,480
says I'm gonna make you fishers of men.

51
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,000
We begin to understand as we have the whole of scripture,

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,399
as we begin to understand the life and ministry

53
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,679
of the Lord Jesus Christ

54
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,600
and what Jesus taught the disciples

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
during his earthly ministry

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,199
and then obviously having the whole of scripture,

57
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,960
we understand what is meant by being a fisher of men.

58
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
We understand the responsibility

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,880
that God has given us and given to these disciples

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,600
to go and to reach people, human beings,

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,320
with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,199
And we find this evening that as we take

63
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,119
and look at this over the next several weeks,

64
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,679
that really my desire is that we might be equipped

65
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:47,240
so that we can be effective and also consistent

66
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,679
in sharing the gospel

67
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,919
with those that we come in contact with.

68
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,559
There are times, no doubt,

69
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,160
we're not gonna take a bunch of surveys

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,080
and polls amongst the people that are here,

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,559
but there are times, no doubt,

72
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,440
that we have been in situations

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,880
where we have shied away from being able

74
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,240
to speak forth the truth of the gospel for some reason.

75
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,199
And what that reason might be

76
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,559
is going to vary from person to person,

77
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,199
whether there was some level of intimidation

78
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,720
because of others that were around,

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,199
maybe there was a measure of intimidation

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,520
because of the education level of the individual

81
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,119
that you were going to engage in,

82
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:28,160
maybe it was because of another religious persuasion

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,279
of that individual,

84
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,119
and I'm just not sure that I know

85
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,600
how to answer the questions,

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm not going to be able to, I'm inadequate,

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,119
whatever the case may be.

88
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,639
The reality is that Jesus said,

89
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,440
follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

90
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,479
It is a work that the Lord Jesus Christ does in his people

91
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,759
that are faithfully following him.

92
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,160
And that's an important point for us to recognize,

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,679
even at the very beginning of this study

94
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,520
over the next few Sunday nights,

95
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,399
is that he told us to follow him,

96
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:05,520
and he says, I will make you fishers of men.

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,880
There is an equipping that God does

98
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,600
in the life of his people that cannot be explained,

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,119
it cannot be taught in a classroom,

100
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,480
it's something that God Almighty does

101
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
in the lives of those that are fully surrendered

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,440
and yielded to following him.

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,200
And it's something that there are times,

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,559
I've heard people say things like this,

105
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,720
it can't be taught, it has to be caught

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,079
in various types of terminologies that people will use,

107
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,399
but the reality is that our greatest duty

108
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,959
is to follow Christ, is to follow Christ.

109
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,920
And I would say this, that as we're following Christ,

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,679
and we're coming into his presence,

111
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,000
and we're spending time with him in his word,

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,359
and we're having that time of prayer that we're to have,

113
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,679
and we're truly following him,

114
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,799
that he does a supernatural work

115
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,440
that is far superior than someone

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,920
that would just go sit in a classroom

117
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
and try to get all of the how-to information,

118
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,920
but isn't following Christ.

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,600
Does that make sense to you this evening?

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,559
And the reality is that there are some,

121
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,920
listen, there are some that have quote-unquote seminars

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,000
on how to do what we're talking about this evening,

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,279
and there are some that would almost use tactics

124
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,720
that you would look at in the sales world

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,760
of how you can sell the gospel.

126
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,559
Can I tell you this evening, the gospel's not for sale.

127
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,359
It's not for sale.

128
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:38,920
It is not for you and it is not for me to sell the gospel.

129
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,119
No, we are to freely give the truth of the gospel.

130
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:46,119
Can we be equipped to be able to do it effectively,

131
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,200
so on and so forth?

132
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,320
Sure, but I'm not trying to,

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
and I'm not going to suggest

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,959
that we adopt the world's philosophies

135
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,480
and try to apply them to the Christian life

136
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,959
or to the church life

137
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,679
in order to try to have some kind of statistics,

138
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,760
and that's just not the way it works.

139
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,320
Listen, I am thankful this evening

140
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,640
that God gave us the opportunity

141
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,640
and the responsibility to be his representatives.

142
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
And so over the next few weeks,

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,359
tonight we're gonna deal with really the groundwork,

144
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,440
if you will, and kind of start there,

145
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,519
but over the next few weeks,

146
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,079
we'll deal with several different things.

147
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,579
Next week in particular,

148
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:27,440
we're gonna deal with really how to handle the conversation,

149
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,799
how to direct a conversation towards things of Christ,

150
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:35,220
not with regard to a sales tactic,

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,880
but with regard to if you're truly following Christ,

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,119
you wanna talk about him.

153
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,839
If you're truly walking with Christ,

154
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,559
if you're following him, then you wanna talk about him.

155
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,000
Let me tell you what Jesus is doing.

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Let me tell you what he's done in my,

157
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,559
so on and so forth, right?

158
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,820
And so it's not something that we're trying to manufacture.

159
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,820
It's just an outflow of the fact that I'm following Jesus.

160
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,619
We begin to look at probably week three, maybe week four,

161
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,299
depending on how long the series goes.

162
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,640
It's just a mini series,

163
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,720
but in those either third or fourth week,

164
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,660
I'm gonna deal with how to be equipped.

165
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,540
See, we ought to be equipped.

166
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,779
It's not that we are not gonna be equipped.

167
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,359
God does a supernatural work in us,

168
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,440
but we ought to be equipped, but here's the danger,

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,100
and I'm gonna deal with this in great detail

170
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,239
in that third or fourth lesson, and that is this.

171
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:29,239
We don't seek to be equipped so that we can win arguments.

172
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,820
I touched on that a little bit this morning

173
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,940
in the message with regard to learning,

174
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,660
having a biblical perspective on contending,

175
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,459
when to contend, how to contend, where to contend.

176
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,720
We are to earnestly contend for the faith.

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,200
It is a truth of God's word,

178
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,299
but we must have wisdom in how we do that,

179
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,880
and the reality is that when I go

180
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,140
and try to engage somebody with the gospel,

181
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,899
when the Holy Spirit of God is leading me

182
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,200
to have a conversation with an individual,

183
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,059
it is not for me to try to determine through conversation

184
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:05,839
what their religious affiliation is and then attack that.

185
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,019
That's not gonna win you any kind of success whatsoever

186
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:12,739
because walls come up, barriers are set,

187
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,799
it becomes a, it's just a debate.

188
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,420
How would you feel if somebody approached you

189
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,739
on those grounds?

190
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,579
It's a real problem, and so we'll deal with that

191
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,299
in more detail in that third or fourth lesson

192
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,440
with regard to how to be equipped,

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,899
but the purpose for being equipped.

194
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,859
The purpose for being equipped is not

195
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,099
so that I can win the argument, so that I can,

196
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,099
no, the purpose of being equipped

197
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,179
is so that I have some level of idea

198
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,739
of where to go scripturally,

199
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,260
be able to share some verses that are pertinent,

200
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,979
not saying, oh, well, as a fill-in-the-blank,

201
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,780
you believe this, and here's what,

202
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,979
no, no, no, that's not gonna work.

203
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,979
You're attacking them, and it's not going to go well.

204
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,820
So this evening, as we set the groundwork,

205
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,419
if you're taking notes, number one,

206
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,260
we must first note the mission.

207
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,340
Note the mission.

208
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,979
Jesus says, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

209
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,500
It's interesting, their response, it says,

210
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,700
they straightway left their nets and followed him.

211
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,859
Isn't that wonderful, how they immediately followed

212
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,059
the Lord Jesus Christ, and we understand,

213
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,419
as you study through the Gospels,

214
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,700
and then, of course, throughout the New Testament,

215
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,820
Peter, in particular, is the text of scripture

216
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,979
throughout the Bible, will follow his life

217
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,580
and his ministry, they understood the mission,

218
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,859
they embraced the mission, they straightway,

219
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,539
immediately left their nets and followed him,

220
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,419
followed the Lord Jesus Christ.

221
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:35,140
Now, over the next several period of time,

222
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,580
years in their lives, they followed Christ

223
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,619
and Christ used them, he equipped them, he helped them.

224
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,340
Of course, Peter eventually would preach

225
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,219
on the day of Pentecost and have such a prominent role

226
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,500
in the early church, and we find that God used him mightily.

227
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,559
We must understand this evening,

228
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,119
the mission that is before us.

229
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,380
We know that it really is a mandate.

230
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,059
This mandate is clear, God has graciously provided

231
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,459
for us in each gospel and also in the book of Acts,

232
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,579
a record of this mandate.

233
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,379
In each gospel and in the book of Acts,

234
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,459
it's not said exactly the same way,

235
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,319
but the content, the idea of the mission

236
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,179
is clearly communicated.

237
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,739
We'll look here in Matthew's gospel, Matthew 28.

238
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,899
It's a text of scripture that we're familiar with.

239
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,559
In Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20,

240
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,339
we'll start in verse 18 down through verse number 20.

241
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,259
Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

242
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,219
Notice as we are looking here to note the mission,

243
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,299
why do we even have this conversation?

244
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,739
Why do we even deal with this?

245
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:38,299
Well, because Christ has left us,

246
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,259
his people, with a mission.

247
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,499
He's given us a command.

248
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:42,419
It says in verse 18,

249
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,839
"'And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,

250
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,099
"'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

251
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,639
"'Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations,

252
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,719
"'baptizing them in the name of the Father

253
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,379
"'and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

254
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,639
"'teaching them to observe all things

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,679
"'whatsoever I have commanded you.

256
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,979
"'And lo, I am with you always,

257
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,359
"'even unto the end of the world.

258
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,319
"'Amen.'"

259
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,599
And so we find that this often we'll refer to

260
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,119
as being the great commission.

261
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,879
This is Matthew's record.

262
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,919
Again, each gospel, the book of Acts

263
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,439
can carry in those books this mission,

264
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,919
this mandate that God has given to us.

265
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,119
And it's really not confusing.

266
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,879
It's very straightforward.

267
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,119
The responsibility that has been given

268
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,339
to the people of God.

269
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,180
We must understand this evening

270
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,259
that God did not commission us,

271
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,500
nor when we go out, do we have the perspective

272
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,180
that we're trying to quote unquote force

273
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,379
our beliefs on other people.

274
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,619
There are times that we're charged with that,

275
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,319
we're accused of.

276
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,059
You're just trying to force your beliefs on other people.

277
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,379
I'm not trying to force my beliefs on anybody.

278
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,739
Listen, when I knock on doors,

279
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,519
if you've ever gone door knocking with me,

280
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,019
when I talk to people in a community,

281
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,739
if you've ever been around me when I do it,

282
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,299
I knock on the door, somebody comes to the door

283
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,419
and they say, hey, we're not interested.

284
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,779
I say, hey, listen, have a great day.

285
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,659
I'm not mad at them.

286
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,619
I don't argue with them.

287
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,019
I don't attack them.

288
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,220
I don't tell, no, I just, hey, have a great day.

289
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,179
Would you at least take this and read it later

290
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,679
at your convenience?

291
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,380
Sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say,

292
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
nope, I don't want it.

293
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,059
Okay, have a great day.

294
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,779
I'm not trying to force our beliefs on anybody.

295
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,759
We believe this evening in individual soul liberty.

296
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,699
We believe that every single person is a Bible truth.

297
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,580
It is a staple of our doctrine

298
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,259
that we believe every individual has a right

299
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,220
to believe whatever they want.

300
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,259
We don't believe in conversion by the sword.

301
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,220
We don't believe that you can force a personal choice

302
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,899
upon anyone to, you know, it's just not something we believe.

303
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,300
It is an individual person's decision.

304
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,259
With that individual soul liberty

305
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,679
comes individual responsibility and accountability.

306
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,800
They're responsible and they're accountable

307
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,080
for what they believe, what they choose to believe,

308
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,880
what they reject and what they receive.

309
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,720
They're responsible for that.

310
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm responsible for seeking to try to give them the truth,

311
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
but it is not my job, nor is it your job

312
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,639
to force our teaching or our beliefs upon anyone.

313
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Now, not every people group, not every denomination

314
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,559
under the broad term of Christendom

315
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,239
has that same philosophy, all right?

316
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,440
They just don't believe that.

317
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,039
And this evening, we believe

318
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,360
that Christ has given us a mission,

319
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,639
but remember that Jesus said,

320
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,479
hey, if they don't listen to you,

321
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,039
shake off the dust and go to the next place, right?

322
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,880
It's not my job.

323
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,839
Listen, I've sat, I've been in,

324
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,720
when I was in Bible college and other seminars

325
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,160
that I've gone to, I've heard people give statements

326
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,720
with regard to how you continue

327
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,080
to try to engage the person

328
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,559
after they tell you they're not interested

329
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,800
and you stick your foot in their door

330
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,279
and you do this and you do that.

331
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,160
That's just, it's just not smart.

332
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,440
I almost said something different.

333
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,279
It's just not smart.

334
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,539
It really isn't.

335
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,199
Why?

336
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,080
Because it's not being forced upon.

337
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,759
Do you know this evening that if you force somebody

338
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,799
to say, quote unquote, a sinner's prayer,

339
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,279
that the likelihood of them truly being converted

340
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,839
is very low?

341
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,880
You can't force it.

342
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,639
It's an individual choice.

343
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,799
You can't force your kids to be saved.

344
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,200
You can't force any other person to be saved.

345
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,679
We're not trying to force beliefs on anyone.

346
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,459
We're simply understanding the mission

347
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,279
that God has given to us

348
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,339
and we're seeking to fulfill that mission effectively

349
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,139
and consistently.

350
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,660
As a church, we have a responsibility.

351
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,019
Why do we have Saturday outreach?

352
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,179
Why is it that we're seeking to do that?

353
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,980
You say, I can reach people throughout the week.

354
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,579
You should.

355
00:14:58,579 --> 00:14:59,419
You should.

356
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:00,940
When you go throughout your week,

357
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,100
you should be actively carrying gospel tracts with you

358
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,940
and seizing the opportunities that God would give you

359
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,059
to be a witness, to be his representative

360
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,220
in your neighborhood, in your workplace,

361
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,339
wherever God would give you an opportunity.

362
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,019
The reality, however, is that as a church,

363
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,059
so somebody says, well, I do that during the week

364
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,239
so I don't have to come on Saturday.

365
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,220
I'm not saying that you have to come on Saturday,

366
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,820
but I want you to understand why is it

367
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,019
that we have an organized outreach program.

368
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,779
As a church, God has put us in this community

369
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,139
to be a light in this community.

370
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,000
Amen, he's placed us here.

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,600
I've said often, you're never gonna find a missionary

372
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,799
on our missions board to Oakton, Virginia,

373
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,519
to Fairfax, Virginia, why?

374
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,440
Because God has placed us as his representatives,

375
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,040
his missionaries, if you will, in Oakton, in Fairfax.

376
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,119
And we should strategically and systematically

377
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:59,399
reach our community, our Jerusalem,

378
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,679
with the doctrine, with the gospel, right?

379
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,720
So if we're not taking and strategically

380
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,959
and systematically reaching our community,

381
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,320
our Jerusalem, with the truth of God's word,

382
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,239
with the gospel, then the reality is that you and I,

383
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,600
we may never come into contact with the guy

384
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,859
that lives a half a block from here.

385
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,119
We may never cross paths with that individual.

386
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,079
With the people, listen, when I first got here

387
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,519
and started knocking doors, there was somebody,

388
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,359
Manuel and Maria, a neighbor of yours.

389
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,880
I doubt that they still live there.

390
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,100
Two doors from where you currently live.

391
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,320
I knocked on their door.

392
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,040
Joseph was with me as my partner,

393
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,000
and we knocked on their door, and they argued with me

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
for about 10 minutes that there's no church

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,179
on Oakton Road.

396
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,480
I mean, they were absolutely adamant.

397
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,600
I drive the road every day.

398
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,880
I go to work that way.

399
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,000
I come home that way.

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,639
There is no church on Oakton Road.

401
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,600
It was like they were accusing me of lying.

402
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,559
And it was really kind of an interesting conversation.

403
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,239
And so, Ron, I tried to get creative,

404
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,760
and here's what I said at the end of the conversation.

405
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,959
I was like, listen, are you gonna go to work on Monday?

406
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,799
And they said, yes.

407
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,799
I said, how about this?

408
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,919
When you go to work on Monday,

409
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,040
about a half mile up the road,

410
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,959
when you turn onto Oakton Road, look to the right.

411
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,279
There's a little church, white church

412
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,320
that sits up on the hill.

413
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,700
And if it's there, will you come on Sunday?

414
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,959
And they said, well, I'm not gonna say that.

415
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,079
And I'm like, well, come on, you know?

416
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,440
And the reality is that, listen, we have neighbors.

417
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
Now, we live here now, and we've actively tried

418
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,639
to reach some neighbors.

419
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,200
We just have a brand new neighbor that moved in yesterday.

420
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
The moving truck was there yesterday.

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,600
So we're gonna purpose to go over there

422
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,160
and we're gonna try to take them a meal,

423
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,639
but not to think that we're poisoning them, right?

424
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,559
We live in a weird day.

425
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,600
25 years ago, a new person moves on the block.

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
Like, it's great to bring them an apple pie,

427
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,839
and like, hey, welcome to the neighborhood.

428
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,399
Today, people look at you like you're crazy.

429
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,480
And so it's a different era that we're living in,

430
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,940
but we wanna reach these people

431
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,040
because we have a responsibility.

432
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,239
So as a church, how are we gonna reach our community

433
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,000
and be purposed in it?

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,119
We have to understand and know the mission.

435
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,359
Number two, consider your motivation.

436
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,160
I believe this is an important foundational truth.

437
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,919
When we talk about this idea of being fishers of men,

438
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,540
what is our motivation?

439
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,760
I would say this.

440
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Our primary motivation must be obedience to God

441
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,859
and love for God.

442
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,679
That is our primary motivation.

443
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,739
Our secondary motivation can be the condition of mankind.

444
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,900
But if we get that out of order, we get messed up.

445
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,900
If our primary motivation is the condition of mankind,

446
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:54,539
they reject you, they call you whatever,

447
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,479
they yell at you, they call the police on you,

448
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,340
whatever they do, all of a sudden,

449
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,380
your motivation's gonna dwindle quickly.

450
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,020
Because your motivation is people.

451
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,580
When your motivation, purely speaking,

452
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,219
you have pure motives that my motivation

453
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:14,559
is out of obedience to God and love for God.

454
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,380
That's why I wanna go and tell people

455
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,619
about the Lord Jesus Christ.

456
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,080
That's why I wanna share the gospel.

457
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,979
Note this in John 14, in verse 15,

458
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,619
we're familiar with the verse of scripture,

459
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,460
but it says, if you love me, keep my commandments.

460
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,299
Right, if you love me, keep my commandments.

461
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:32,179
We understand the commandment that's been given,

462
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,779
and so if we love him, we're to keep his commandments,

463
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:38,299
and this, no doubt, must be the primary motivation

464
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,020
for all that we do in life.

465
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
I've mentioned this in previous messages,

466
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
the idea of the audience of one,

467
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,739
the fact that all that we do is for the Lord Jesus Christ.

468
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,260
It's out of love for him and obedience to him

469
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,099
and to his word that we do what we do as believers.

470
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,099
I am thankful this evening that my involvement

471
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,260
in our.

472
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,420
reach, my involvement in trying to share the gospel with someone else, your involvement

473
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,180
with trying to share the gospel with someone else has zero to do with your position as

474
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,940
being a child of God.

475
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,340
We can't work our way to heaven, amen?

476
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,980
It's just not something we can do.

477
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,540
And we understand that biblically salvation is all Christ, Christ alone.

478
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,540
So I don't go and try to share the gospel with someone so that I can be saved, so that

479
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,820
I can go to heaven, no, we do it out of love for God and obedience to God.

480
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,900
It's important for us to understand that, that's our motivation.

481
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,780
I remember having a conversation with an individual and through the conversation they kept pushing

482
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,940
back but they stayed open and it was kind of an interesting dialogue and through that

483
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,660
conversation and interaction with that individual, at one point I finally looked at them and

484
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:58,460
I said this, listen, I'm going to heaven whether you do or not.

485
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,180
I've been saved by the blood of Christ.

486
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,860
I am heaven bound.

487
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,700
The deal is that I would like for you to go to heaven when you die because I understand,

488
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,220
I've read Revelation 20.

489
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,860
Have you read Revelation 20?

490
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,260
The scene of the great white throne judgment is not a pleasant scene in Revelation 20 verses

491
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,900
11 through 15.

492
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,540
It's a sad scene and the reality is that I've read that so I understand where lost man will

493
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:29,340
spend eternity according to what God's word says and so therefore I want this person to

494
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,060
go to heaven but I'm going to heaven whether they do or don't.

495
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,540
Whether they accept the message or not, I'm going to heaven, amen?

496
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,980
But I want them to go to heaven.

497
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,620
But my primary motivation can't be I want them to go to heaven, it's that I want to

498
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:51,900
obey Christ and it's important for us to understand that because if we get it in reverse order,

499
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
it will be short-lived.

500
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
It'll be short-lived.

501
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,260
Why?

502
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,700
Because rejection after rejection after rejection after rejection, you're going to say what's

503
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,820
the point?

504
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,260
No one wants to hear me.

505
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
No one cares.

506
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
No one listens.

507
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
No one does.

508
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
No, no, no.

509
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:14,500
If my primary motivation is obedience to God, love for my Savior, then I can keep going

510
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,500
and keep being faithful even if the rejections come.

511
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Notice in Romans chapter 9 as we mentioned the secondary motivation is no doubt the condition

512
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
of mankind.

513
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,460
Notice what Paul says in Romans 9.

514
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,300
In Romans chapter number 9, in verse number 1, the Bible says this, I say the truth in

515
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,620
Christ I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.

516
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:52,780
He briefly says that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart, for I could

517
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,700
wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to

518
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
the flesh.

519
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,980
He says this in chapter 10 in verse number 1, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer

520
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,380
to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

521
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,260
He says later on in that passage, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall

522
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
be saved.

523
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,620
See, Paul was concerned for the condition of mankind.

524
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:25,460
He had, as he says in chapter 9, great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart.

525
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,140
He desired for the people that he knew, that he understood were his kinsmen according to

526
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:38,780
the flesh, his brethren as he refers to them, that they needed to be saved.

527
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,100
And so it is a true motivation for individuals to understand that the condition of mankind,

528
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,180
but it's a secondary motivation.

529
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,860
The reality this evening is that everyone that you come in contact with is going to

530
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,900
spend somewhere forever.

531
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,980
They're going to be somewhere forever, every person that you come in contact with.

532
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:09,380
And when we truly understand, I wonder how many of us have this type of heart that Paul

533
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,100
does that I have a great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

534
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,180
That great white throne judgment is going to be a sad situation.

535
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,619
Death and hell are cast into the lake of fire.

536
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:30,619
This is the second death, verse 15 of Revelation 20.

537
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:38,540
There's no opportunity to, well, I want to accept now, no, it's too late.

538
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,580
I've often said from the truth of Philippians that the reality is it's a matter of if not

539
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,220
when, or excuse me, when not if, I got that reversed.

540
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,460
When you confess that Jesus is Christ makes all the difference.

541
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,460
You will.

542
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,260
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

543
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Because if you make that confession on this side of death, you'll spend eternity with

544
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,740
Christ in heaven.

545
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,180
But on the other side of death, you'll spend eternity in the lake of fire.

546
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,059
And so we understand the condition of mankind, but the reality is that we must be focused

547
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,020
and understand what our true motivation is, and our true primary motivation must be obedience

548
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,260
to God and love for Christ.

549
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
That's our motivation.

550
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,740
Why do you do what you do?

551
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,180
You know, so often we can be asked that question, we can think about the subject matter of motives.

552
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,260
There are people, no doubt, that judge other people's motives.

553
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,140
There are people that, unfortunately, do not even examine their own motives with regard

554
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,900
to various aspects of ministry.

555
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
Why do you play an instrument?

556
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,100
Why do you sing a song?

557
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,020
Why do you teach a class?

558
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,300
Why do you go and share the gospel with someone else?

559
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,040
Why do you pass out tracts?

560
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,779
Why do you give to church?

561
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:59,900
Why do you…all of those things that we could ask ourselves this evening, there must be

562
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,619
a pure motive of singular truth that I do it out of obedience and love for my God.

563
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,779
It must be the case.

564
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:17,300
And this evening, that is true with regard to the situation of being a fisher of men,

565
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,660
that I must understand, consider what is my motivation.

566
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,380
I would say this, number three, this evening, as we kind of wrap up this first introductory

567
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:31,140
kind of foundational message with regard to going and trying to reach people with the

568
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,020
gospel, number three, make it personal.

569
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Make it personal.

570
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,779
I'm going to deal with that from two perspectives.

571
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:43,779
Number one, that you understand your personal responsibility to share the gospel.

572
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,020
There are some people, unfortunately, throughout the years, throughout the centuries that have

573
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,779
had the idea that it's only the job of, quote-unquote, a full-time pastor, evangelist, missionary,

574
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,900
whatever, to share the gospel.

575
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,660
But the reality is that this responsibility has been given to every one of God's children.

576
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,420
If you're saved this evening by the grace of God, then you have been given a personal

577
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,260
responsibility to be His representative.

578
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,740
And so when I talk about making it personal, we must understand personally, listen, there

579
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,980
are some, like, I'm not going to go to a church that doesn't, you know, have an outreach

580
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
program.

581
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,980
I mean, I don't intend to participate in the outreach program, but I'm not going to go

582
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,140
to a church that doesn't have one.

583
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,700
You understand what I'm saying?

584
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,140
And the reality is that somewhere along the line, we must understand the personal aspect

585
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,420
of this mission that's been given.

586
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:43,300
As a church, we talk about a church as made up of individuals that have been saved by

587
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,260
the grace of God, that have been baptized scripturally, that have joined themselves

588
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:55,220
together, voluntarily joined themselves together for the purpose of carrying out the gospel.

589
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,660
That's our job.

590
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,180
That's our duty.

591
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,779
That's our responsibility.

592
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,540
And we must take it personal.

593
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,740
And here's the amazing thing.

594
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,059
When we take it personal and we begin to go and try to reach the people that God would

595
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:16,180
bring into our sphere of influence, it's amazing how God blesses them and how God works

596
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,420
through that.

597
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,180
And so this evening, we talk about making it personal, understanding my personal responsibility,

598
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,580
but then also make it personal, meaning tell your story.

599
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,220
If you've been saved tonight, you have a story, you have a testimony.

600
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,220
If you've been saved tonight, you have a testimony.

601
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,859
Can I tell you this evening that you know your testimony better than anyone else?

602
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:43,540
You know your testimony better than anyone else.

603
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,940
Would you agree with that?

604
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,220
Now there might be somebody else that has heard you give your testimony that may be

605
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,260
able to share aspects of your testimony and be able to share when it was that maybe your

606
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,260
spouse or your children, when they got saved, and you might be able to share some things.

607
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:04,299
But the reality this evening is that you know your story best.

608
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:05,700
You know your story.

609
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,000
You know what God did in your life.

610
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,020
You know what God was doing leading up to that moment of conversion in your own life.

611
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:20,700
You know how he delivered you and how he gave you a peace and a joy and a purpose that you

612
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,419
didn't have before.

613
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:27,340
And without regard of how old you were when you got saved, the reality is that if you're

614
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,540
saved, you have a testimony.

615
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,179
There are some people that have the perspective that, well, my testimony isn't as good as

616
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,179
their testimony.

617
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:39,179
Nonsense.

618
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,179
Nonsense.

619
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,540
You know why I say that's nonsense?

620
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,100
Because there's not one of us this evening that's the hero of our story.

621
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,140
All of us have something consistent in our story.

622
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,619
You know what it is?

623
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,739
Christ is the hero of our story.

624
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:53,739
Amen?

625
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:57,540
Well, I didn't live a life of sin.

626
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,220
Thank God that you didn't live a life of sin.

627
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,720
Because I can guarantee you, the people that are in the auditorium this evening,

628
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,220
people that you come in contact with that have lived a life of sin before they got saved,

629
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,220
they would stand and say, I wish I did not have to live that life of sin.

630
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,220
I wish I didn't have all that baggage and all of that.

631
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Your story is powerful.

632
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,220
It's personal, but it's also powerful.

633
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,220
No one can tell your story like you can tell your story.

634
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Because you know it best.

635
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
And when you begin to take it personal,

636
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,220
and you begin to share with someone what God was doing in your life,

637
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,220
and how He changed your life, listen, I often,

638
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
I've learned this a number of years ago,

639
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,220
I often, as I try to talk to people about the Lord,

640
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,220
whether it's door to door or whatever other avenue or arena God would give me,

641
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
I often try to deal with it this way.

642
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,220
I say, listen, can I tell you what Christ did for me?

643
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Can I tell you how He changed my life?

644
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I mean, it would just take a few minutes to share with you what He did for me

645
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
and how He changed my life.

646
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,220
You know, oftentimes people are interested to hear a story.

647
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
People will listen.

648
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Listen, if I'm just trying to get them to come to church,

649
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
if I'm just trying to get them to,

650
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
man, they've gone to church, they know church,

651
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
they have, as soon as you say to somebody,

652
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
hey, I just want to invite you to come to our church,

653
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,220
do you know that immediately they have a thought in their mind what church is like?

654
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Immediately.

655
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Whether that's a bad experience or a good experience,

656
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,220
whatever the experience is, they have immediately

657
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,220
a thought in their mind with regard to what church is.

658
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,220
And if they have some level of affiliation to church,

659
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
why do I need to go to your church?

660
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
I go to my church.

661
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
I mean, I don't go often. I kind of haven't been there for a while.

662
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I often will ask people, and I don't mean to embarrass them,

663
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
but when they say, oh, yeah, I go to church, I go all the time, that's wonderful.

664
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
What's your pastor's name?

665
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Oh, man.

666
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
It's such a complicated name, I just can't remember it.

667
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
And it just makes me laugh inside, right?

668
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm not trying to necessarily put them on the spot.

669
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I'm just trying to find out what's going on

670
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,220
and what the certainty is with regard to their position.

671
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
And so here, when I make it personal

672
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,220
and I'm going through the process of telling my story,

673
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,220
not only is it personal, but it's powerful.

674
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,220
And here's the thing.

675
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,220
You should work on being able to share your story.

676
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
You should work on it.

677
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
If I could tonight give you a homework assignment,

678
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
and this isn't school, so I can't,

679
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
if I could make a suggestion,

680
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,220
if you don't already have a way in which you could

681
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
in just a few minutes share your story,

682
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
your testimony of salvation,

683
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,220
would I encourage you to work on that?

684
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Work on it with your spouse.

685
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,220
Maybe with your children.

686
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
You know, it's important from time to time

687
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,220
for us to kind of just share our testimony.

688
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
Share our personal story,

689
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,220
our testimony of what God has done in our lives.

690
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
I've been in settings, I've been in situations

691
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,220
where I've said, hey, let's share our testimonies.

692
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,220
In fact, this happened in Holly's family

693
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
at Christmas a few years ago.

694
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,220
They wanted to start out by just mom and dad boys

695
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,220
sharing their testimony of salvation

696
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,220
and what God did in their life.

697
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
And they shared it, and it was great.

698
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
It was a good time.

699
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Now, it's a big family.

700
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,220
They're like 38 people, man.

701
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
It's like a little church.

702
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
I'm being serious.

703
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
It's like a little church.

704
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
And mom and dad boys share their testimony,

705
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,220
and then it felt like as the Lord was really in that thing

706
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
that, well, why don't we have our children

707
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
share their testimony?

708
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Actually, I think it started

709
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
with the sons and sons-in-laws.

710
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Let's have the heads of the families,

711
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,220
let's have them share their testimony of salvation.

712
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,220
And so there are seven,

713
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
so we all start sharing our testimonies.

714
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
And then it was like, well, why don't the ladies

715
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
share their testimony?

716
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
And then what about the teenagers that are old enough?

717
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,220
Why don't they start sharing their testimony?

718
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
And you know that through that process,

719
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,220
one of the grandchildren that was old enough

720
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,220
realized they didn't have a testimony.

721
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,220
They realized that they weren't saved.

722
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
They couldn't share a testimony.

723
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
You know, just a short time later,

724
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
they trusted Christ as their Savior.

725
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
What a blessing.

726
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
And sometimes it's an opportunity to share,

727
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
but if you say, I don't even know what I would say,

728
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
then work on it.

729
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Figure out how you can share your testimony,

730
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,220
how you can share it personally and powerfully,

731
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:36,220
because again, you're not the hero of your story.

732
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
The Lord is the hero of your story.

733
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
Sometimes I know people will use that phraseology,

734
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,220
I found him.

735
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,220
You didn't find him, he found you.

736
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
Amen?

737
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
He found me.

738
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
He loved me.

739
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,220
I didn't love him.

740
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
He first loved me.

741
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,220
I was his enemy.

742
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,220
But he loved me.

743
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,220
And he was gracious.

744
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
And listen, for me personally,

745
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,220
I had the opportunity to hear the gospel many, many times

746
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
before I ever trusted Christ as my Savior.

747
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,220
I wish tonight I would have trusted Christ as my Savior

748
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
the first time I ever heard the gospel.

749
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
But I didn't.

750
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,220
But you have a story.

751
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Let me show you a couple of passages of Scripture.

752
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Turn to the book of John, if you will.

753
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
We'll look at two passages and then be done this evening.

754
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,220
John chapter number 4.

755
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
As soon as I mention John chapter 4,

756
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
many of us are familiar with the text.

757
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
We understand the woman at the well.

758
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,220
And what a great passage of Scripture it is.

759
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
I don't really want to deal with the interaction

760
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
between Jesus and the woman.

761
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
I want to look at the woman and her story.

762
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
As we deal with this idea of making it personal,

763
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,220
notice in John chapter number 4, look in verse number 28.

764
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,220
The Bible says this.

765
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,220
The woman then left her water pot.

766
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
By the way, why was she there?

767
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
To get water.

768
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
She went back without her water pot.

769
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Why?

770
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Because something better happened than getting some water.

771
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Amen?

772
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
I mean, this was transforming for her.

773
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,220
It was absolutely amazing for her.

774
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,220
And the Bible says that she left her water pot

775
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,220
and went her way into the city and saith to the men.

776
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Notice what she says.

777
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,220
Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.

778
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,220
Is not this the Christ?

779
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Then they, that's the people that she shared her story with,

780
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,220
went out of the city and came unto him.

781
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Isn't that precious?

782
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
It's powerful.

783
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,220
All she did, I mean, listen, her message recorded in Scripture,

784
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
her message was not very lengthy.

785
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
It wasn't very theological.

786
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,220
She didn't have all that.

787
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
She just said, come and see a man.

788
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,220
And what does she say about this man that she is telling them to,

789
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,220
inviting them to come see, which told me all things that ever I did.

790
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
And then she says this.

791
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Is not this the Christ?

792
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Why did she have that perspective?

793
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Well, just a few verses earlier, Jesus said,

794
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,220
I that speak unto thee am he.

795
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,220
She understood that Jesus, the man, the God-man,

796
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,220
this individual that met her that day, was the Christ, Messiah.

797
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
What a joy.

798
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,220
She goes to those people in the city and she offers an invitation,

799
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,220
and the Bible says that they went out of the city and came unto him.

800
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Now, he obviously is going to talk to the disciples there

801
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
because as she leaves, they arrive.

802
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,220
And notice in verse number 38, the Bible says,

803
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,220
I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor.

804
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Other men labored and you entered into their labors.

805
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,220
It's finishing up with the disciples in verse 39.

806
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,220
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him.

807
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Notice what this says.

808
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,220
For the saying of the woman which testified,

809
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,220
he told me all that ever I did.

810
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Many, I don't know how many,

811
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,220
but many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him.

812
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
Isn't that wonderful?

813
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,220
All because she made a decision to go tell a personal story,

814
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
a personal testimony.

815
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,220
All because she took and said, come, see a man.

816
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Is not this the Christ?

817
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,220
He told me everything I've ever done.

818
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,220
And we find that these people responded to the invitation

819
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
and there were many that believed.

820
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
Now, the Bible says in verse number 40,

821
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
so when the Samaritans were come unto him,

822
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
they besought him that he would tarry with them,

823
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
and he abode there two days.

824
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
And many more believed because of his own word.

825
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,220
And said unto the woman, now we believe not because of thy saying,

826
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,220
for we have heard him ourselves and know that this indeed,

827
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,220
or that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.

828
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,220
But I want you to understand that because of the interaction,

829
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,220
listen, she still was part of that whole thing.

830
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
She's still part of it.

831
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Your testimony this evening is powerful.

832
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Take it personally.

833
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Make it personal.

834
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
Notice in John chapter nine,

835
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,220
I referenced quickly this morning,

836
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,220
this portion of Scripture with regard to the religious leaders at the end

837
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
saying, are we blind also?

838
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,220
But I want to draw your attention just for a moment

839
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,220
to this man that was born blind.

840
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,220
The Bible introduces us in verse number one of chapter nine.

841
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,220
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

842
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,220
And this man, through a miracle that took place,

843
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Jesus tells him to go wash in the pool of Siloam

844
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,220
and he came seeing according to verse number seven.

845
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:48,220
And oh, what a scene unfolds in John chapter nine.

846
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,220
All the religious leaders and calling for the parents

847
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
and all that takes place.

848
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,220
And we find that this man, after being asked many times,

849
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,220
in verse number 25,

850
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
they called again.

851
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,580
And according to verse number 24,

852
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,740
then again called they the man that was blind

853
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,420
and said unto him, give God the praise.

854
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,860
We know that this man is a sinner.

855
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,620
They're talking about Christ being a sinner.

856
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,100
No, he's the sinless, perfect Lamb of God.

857
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,080
He's God in flesh.

858
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,060
But they called him again.

859
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,460
And it's almost, if I could read into the text

860
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,020
just a little bit this evening,

861
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,540
it's almost like he was overwhelmed and frustrated

862
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,140
with another line of questioning,

863
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,660
like he's being asked this again.

864
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
And notice in verse 25, he answered and said,

865
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,140
whether he be a sinner or no, I know not.

866
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,140
One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.

867
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,500
Then said they to him again, what did he to thee?

868
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,760
How opened he thine eyes?

869
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,300
We find that it says he answered them,

870
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,240
I have told you already and you did not hear,

871
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,980
wherefore would you hear it again?

872
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,940
Will you also be his disciples?

873
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,140
Now that didn't go over very well.

874
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,980
That was a real problem for these religious leaders, right?

875
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,980
That was not well received.

876
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,060
But can you see almost as being frustrated,

877
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,660
like why are you still asking me?

878
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,780
But I wanna just draw your attention to verse 25.

879
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,380
He says, look, I don't know how to answer all your questions

880
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,140
but one thing I know, I was blind and now I see.

881
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,060
Can I tell you that this miracle is still being talked about

882
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,660
at the end of chapter number 10?

883
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,220
It's still being talked about.

884
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,060
Excuse me, the end of chapter 11.

885
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,860
In chapter 11, the situation with Nicodemus,

886
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,380
I know I said chapter 10, sorry, chapter 11.

887
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,260
The end of the chapter, the Jews that are there,

888
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,860
they say in verse 37, those that were mourning

889
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,140
because of the death of Lazarus,

890
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,640
could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind

891
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,700
have caused that even this man should not have died.

892
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,580
This was an impactful miracle in John chapter number nine.

893
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,940
But this man stands, he says, look,

894
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,540
I can't answer all your questions

895
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,300
but this one thing I can tell you,

896
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,820
I was blind and now I see.

897
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,460
We understand that that was a physical condition.

898
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,580
He then later in the text of scripture

899
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,180
understands who Jesus is.

900
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,660
Jesus comes back to him and at verse number 38,

901
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,180
he says, Lord, I believe and he worshiped him.

902
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,940
What a joy.

903
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,740
Listen, I want you to understand this evening,

904
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,940
you may not be able to answer everyone's questions

905
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,380
but you really don't have to.

906
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,180
Can I tell you, I have been asked

907
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,020
some crazy off the wall questions.

908
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,580
I'm serious, man.

909
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,140
I have been asked some questions that I'm like, where?

910
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,500
Like, what have you been watching?

911
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,900
I've never, if you like Star Wars or that stuff,

912
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,900
like I'm not criticizing you, I've just never watched it

913
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,340
and I really have zero desire to watch it

914
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,840
but I wonder sometimes as some people

915
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,860
come up with these questions, I'm like, man,

916
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,700
they've been watching Star Wars for so long,

917
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,980
they've been watching something, man.

918
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,800
I don't know what they're watching

919
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,020
but they come up with all these weird scenarios

920
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,220
and hypotheticals and I don't even think

921
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,780
they believe what they're asking.

922
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,420
They're just trying to derail you.

923
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,300
They're just trying to detour you.

924
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,620
They're trying to avoid the subject matter.

925
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,020
There are many times I say, you know what,

926
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,140
that's a good question but can we deal with that later?

927
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,020
Sometimes people want you to answer every theology question

928
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,600
that they can throw at you.

929
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,820
I'm not suggesting that we should not be ready,

930
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,760
as Peter says, to give an answer to every man

931
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,020
of the hope that lieth within us

932
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,500
but what I am suggesting this evening

933
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,780
is that we must have wisdom

934
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,140
and we must be able to stand before,

935
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,700
listen, sometimes what happens is God's people

936
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,340
feel inadequate because they think

937
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,860
I can't answer the questions that may be asked of me.

938
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,040
Can I tell you that you can say like that blind man said,

939
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,320
I don't know but here's what I do know.

940
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,860
I was lost and now I'm found.

941
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,540
He said I was blind and now I see

942
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,320
but I'm speaking spiritually this evening.

943
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,220
I was lost and now I'm found.

944
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,100
I had no direction, I had no peace,

945
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,500
I had no joy, I had no confidence.

946
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,660
In fact, the very thought of dying scared me.

947
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,460
Terrified of the thought of dying.

948
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,540
I had no idea what would happen

949
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,920
and then it terrified me even more

950
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,380
after I had been exposed to the gospel

951
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,540
and I knew what would happen if I died without Christ.

952
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,340
I was miserable and then on that day

953
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,220
when God graciously saved my soul,

954
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,660
I haven't feared death.

955
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,620
I have a joy that I can't really explain.

956
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,400
I have a peace that I can't fully comprehend.

957
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,260
Why?

958
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,700
Because he saved me, he changed my life.

959
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Can I tell you that sometimes being able to answer

960
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,660
all the crazy questions is actually more of a detriment?

961
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,940
Just gets you all in the weeds.

962
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,500
Seriously, sidetracked on stuff

963
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,220
that absolutely has nothing to do with the gospel.

964
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,300
With the gospel.

965
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,500
We're trying to get people to, lost people,

966
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,860
as I mentioned this morning from 1 Corinthians 2.14,

967
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,860
we're trying to get lost people, the natural man,

968
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,500
to understand spiritual things

969
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,100
before they've been born again.

970
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,340
I've been guilty of it.

971
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,900
Maybe you've been guilty of it as well.

972
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,860
It's frustrating because you're trying to get a lost person

973
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,420
to understand a spiritual truth

974
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,620
that they can't fully understand until they're born again.

975
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,700
Ye must be born again.

976
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,500
We must understand the mission.

977
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,100
God's given us this mission.

978
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,040
We must have proper motivation.

979
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,500
It's obedience to God, love for God.

980
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,820
And it's imperative that we make it personal.

981
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,340
It's my personal responsibility,

982
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,480
but it's also my personal testimony.

983
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,020
This evening, if you're saved by the grace of God,

984
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,540
you have a testimony, you have a story.

985
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,340
And your story is personal, but it's also powerful.

986
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,660
And if you don't, if you've not practiced

987
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,020
on being able to share your testimony, share your story,

988
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,220
can I encourage you this week, share your story.

989
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,100
Get with someone, talk to someone.

990
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,420
If you wanna share your story with me,

991
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,640
many of you, if you're a member here,

992
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,900
you've already shared your story with me

993
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,540
because you couldn't join the church if you didn't, amen.

994
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,340
But what I'm saying is that, listen,

995
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,580
it's good for us to be able to share our story.

996
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,180
It shouldn't be awkward for you to share your story

997
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,580
because Christ is the hero of my story.

998
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,540
And can I tell you what he did for me?

999
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,140
Can I tell you how he changed my life?

1000
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,900
And it's amazing the open doors that God will provide.

1001
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,380
Fishers of Men, part one.

1002
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,860
Next week, we'll deal with another aspect of the how-to

1003
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,920
and really getting into the nuts and bolts, if you will,

1004
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,340
after we understand the foundation.

1005
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,260
Let's pray.

1006
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,100
Father, we love you.

1007
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,180
We thank you for loving us.

1008
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,900
Thank you for the opportunity to be gathered this evening.

1009
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,300
Thank you for the freedom to worship you.

1010
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,180
Thank you for the freedom to go into our community,

1011
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,260
to go into the marketplace, the workplace,

1012
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,420
wherever it is that we are,

1013
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,180
to have the freedom and the opportunity

1014
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,580
to be able to be your representatives, your ambassadors.

1015
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,540
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be equipped.

1016
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,180
I pray, Lord, that you'd help us to have this understanding

1017
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,740
of our personal testimony.

1018
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,900
Lord, if there's some here this evening

1019
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,460
that just have never really thought about

1020
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,500
or never developed and worked on

1021
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,820
being able to share their testimony,

1022
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,340
God, I pray that you'd help them this evening

1023
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,220
to be able to put down the thoughts

1024
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,300
and to bring into memory,

1025
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,540
to be able to share with others

1026
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,940
the great work that you did in their life

1027
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,660
in saving their soul.

1028
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,700
I pray, God, that you'd bless the time of invitation.

1029
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,140
I pray that through all that's said and done

1030
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,060
that you alone will be glorified and we'll thank you for it.

1031
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,060
In Christ's name we pray.
