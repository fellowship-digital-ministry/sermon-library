00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.759
number four this evening.

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:03.119
I mentioned this morning,

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:07.880
and you see it on the back of your bulletin today as well,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.560
that this is going to be part one.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.000
I think we're gonna be three weeks.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.880
It might be four.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.039
It just depends on how well you listen.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.520
And no, just kidding,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.120
how quickly I can get through the material.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.979
I really don't wanna rush through this.

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:21.440
I think it's so important,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.360
the subject matter that we're gonna deal with

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.319
over these next three or four weeks,

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.440
depending on how the Lord leads

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.239
and how much we're able to get through.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.040
But the reality is that when we look

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.319
at this passage of scripture,

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.560
I'm not gonna deal really with the content of the miracle

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.000
and all the things that take place and what have you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.360
But I really want you to see,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.680
if you were to look in Luke's gospel,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.040
you can see a great event that takes place.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.119
But here in Matthew chapter four,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.240
I want you to notice in verse 19,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.279
we're just gonna use this single verse of scripture

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.080
and kind of use it as a springboard

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400
and go forth throughout the scriptures this evening

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.959
and really kind of lay a foundation, if you will.

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.479
Jesus says unto them, it says,

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.319
and he saith unto them, so Jesus is speaking.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.519
He's talking to Peter and Andrew, his brother.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:09.199
And it says this, follow me,

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:14.199
and I will make thee, make you fishers of men.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.000
And of course, we know that by trade, by occupation,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.360
they were fishermen.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.000
In fact, you will find that as they were

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.919
giving the instruction throughout their lives

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.480
and with regard to the fish and all that they did,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.680
we find that even as you think about this occupation

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.400
that they had, now Jesus, knowing their occupation,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.720
knowing who they are, he says,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.879
I'm gonna make you fishers of men.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.639
And what a great term that Jesus uses.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:49.040
They were catching fish for business purposes,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.360
for obviously a source of food

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.720
and also to provide for themselves and their families

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.000
through an enterprise of selling and trading

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.319
and so on and so forth.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.680
But now the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.480
says I'm gonna make you fishers of men.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.000
We begin to understand as we have the whole of scripture,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.399
as we begin to understand the life and ministry

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.679
of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.600
and what Jesus taught the disciples

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.800
during his earthly ministry

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.199
and then obviously having the whole of scripture,

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.960
we understand what is meant by being a fisher of men.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.520
We understand the responsibility

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.880
that God has given us and given to these disciples

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.600
to go and to reach people, human beings,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.320
with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.199
And we find this evening that as we take

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.119
and look at this over the next several weeks,

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.679
that really my desire is that we might be equipped

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.240
so that we can be effective and also consistent

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.679
in sharing the gospel

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.919
with those that we come in contact with.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.559
There are times, no doubt,

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.160
we're not gonna take a bunch of surveys

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.080
and polls amongst the people that are here,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.559
but there are times, no doubt,

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.440
that we have been in situations

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.880
where we have shied away from being able

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.240
to speak forth the truth of the gospel for some reason.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.199
And what that reason might be

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.559
is going to vary from person to person,

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.199
whether there was some level of intimidation

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.720
because of others that were around,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.199
maybe there was a measure of intimidation

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.520
because of the education level of the individual

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.119
that you were going to engage in,

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.160
maybe it was because of another religious persuasion

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.279
of that individual,

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.119
and I'm just not sure that I know

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.600
how to answer the questions,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.960
I'm not going to be able to, I'm inadequate,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.119
whatever the case may be.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.639
The reality is that Jesus said,

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.440
follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.479
It is a work that the Lord Jesus Christ does in his people

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.759
that are faithfully following him.

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.160
And that's an important point for us to recognize,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.679
even at the very beginning of this study

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.520
over the next few Sunday nights,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.399
is that he told us to follow him,

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.520
and he says, I will make you fishers of men.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.880
There is an equipping that God does

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.600
in the life of his people that cannot be explained,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.119
it cannot be taught in a classroom,

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.480
it's something that God Almighty does

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.200
in the lives of those that are fully surrendered

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.440
and yielded to following him.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.200
And it's something that there are times,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.559
I've heard people say things like this,

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.720
it can't be taught, it has to be caught

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.079
in various types of terminologies that people will use,

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:36.399
but the reality is that our greatest duty

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.959
is to follow Christ, is to follow Christ.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.920
And I would say this, that as we're following Christ,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.679
and we're coming into his presence,

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:48.000
and we're spending time with him in his word,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.359
and we're having that time of prayer that we're to have,

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:53.679
and we're truly following him,

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.799
that he does a supernatural work

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:01.440
that is far superior than someone

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.920
that would just go sit in a classroom

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.760
and try to get all of the how-to information,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.920
but isn't following Christ.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.600
Does that make sense to you this evening?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.559
And the reality is that there are some,

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.920
listen, there are some that have quote-unquote seminars

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.000
on how to do what we're talking about this evening,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.279
and there are some that would almost use tactics

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.720
that you would look at in the sales world

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.760
of how you can sell the gospel.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.559
Can I tell you this evening, the gospel's not for sale.

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:34.359
It's not for sale.

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:38.920
It is not for you and it is not for me to sell the gospel.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.119
No, we are to freely give the truth of the gospel.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.119
Can we be equipped to be able to do it effectively,

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.200
so on and so forth?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.320
Sure, but I'm not trying to,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.000
and I'm not going to suggest

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.959
that we adopt the world's philosophies

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.480
and try to apply them to the Christian life

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.959
or to the church life

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.679
in order to try to have some kind of statistics,

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.760
and that's just not the way it works.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.320
Listen, I am thankful this evening

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.640
that God gave us the opportunity

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.640
and the responsibility to be his representatives.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.000
And so over the next few weeks,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.359
tonight we're gonna deal with really the groundwork,

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:20.440
if you will, and kind of start there,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.519
but over the next few weeks,

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:23.079
we'll deal with several different things.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.579
Next week in particular,

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:27.440
we're gonna deal with really how to handle the conversation,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.799
how to direct a conversation towards things of Christ,

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:35.220
not with regard to a sales tactic,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.880
but with regard to if you're truly following Christ,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.119
you wanna talk about him.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.839
If you're truly walking with Christ,

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.559
if you're following him, then you wanna talk about him.

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:49.000
Let me tell you what Jesus is doing.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.200
Let me tell you what he's done in my,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.559
so on and so forth, right?

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.820
And so it's not something that we're trying to manufacture.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.820
It's just an outflow of the fact that I'm following Jesus.

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.619
We begin to look at probably week three, maybe week four,

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:04.299
depending on how long the series goes.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.640
It's just a mini series,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.720
but in those either third or fourth week,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.660
I'm gonna deal with how to be equipped.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.540
See, we ought to be equipped.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.779
It's not that we are not gonna be equipped.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.359
God does a supernatural work in us,

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:19.440
but we ought to be equipped, but here's the danger,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.100
and I'm gonna deal with this in great detail

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.239
in that third or fourth lesson, and that is this.

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:29.239
We don't seek to be equipped so that we can win arguments.

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:32.820
I touched on that a little bit this morning

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.940
in the message with regard to learning,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.660
having a biblical perspective on contending,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.459
when to contend, how to contend, where to contend.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.720
We are to earnestly contend for the faith.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.200
It is a truth of God's word,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.299
but we must have wisdom in how we do that,

00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.880
and the reality is that when I go

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.140
and try to engage somebody with the gospel,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.899
when the Holy Spirit of God is leading me

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.200
to have a conversation with an individual,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.059
it is not for me to try to determine through conversation

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:05.839
what their religious affiliation is and then attack that.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:10.019
That's not gonna win you any kind of success whatsoever

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:12.739
because walls come up, barriers are set,

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.799
it becomes a, it's just a debate.

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:16.420
How would you feel if somebody approached you

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.739
on those grounds?

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.579
It's a real problem, and so we'll deal with that

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:23.299
in more detail in that third or fourth lesson

00:08:23.299 --> 00:08:25.440
with regard to how to be equipped,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.899
but the purpose for being equipped.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:31.859
The purpose for being equipped is not

00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:34.099
so that I can win the argument, so that I can,

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.099
no, the purpose of being equipped

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.179
is so that I have some level of idea

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.739
of where to go scripturally,

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.260
be able to share some verses that are pertinent,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.979
not saying, oh, well, as a fill-in-the-blank,

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.780
you believe this, and here's what,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.979
no, no, no, that's not gonna work.

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:52.979
You're attacking them, and it's not going to go well.

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.820
So this evening, as we set the groundwork,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.419
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.260
we must first note the mission.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.340
Note the mission.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.979
Jesus says, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:05.500
It's interesting, their response, it says,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.700
they straightway left their nets and followed him.

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:10.859
Isn't that wonderful, how they immediately followed

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:13.059
the Lord Jesus Christ, and we understand,

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:15.419
as you study through the Gospels,

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.700
and then, of course, throughout the New Testament,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.820
Peter, in particular, is the text of scripture

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.979
throughout the Bible, will follow his life

00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:25.580
and his ministry, they understood the mission,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.859
they embraced the mission, they straightway,

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.539
immediately left their nets and followed him,

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:32.419
followed the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:35.140
Now, over the next several period of time,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.580
years in their lives, they followed Christ

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.619
and Christ used them, he equipped them, he helped them.

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.340
Of course, Peter eventually would preach

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.219
on the day of Pentecost and have such a prominent role

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:49.500
in the early church, and we find that God used him mightily.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.559
We must understand this evening,

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:53.119
the mission that is before us.

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:55.380
We know that it really is a mandate.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.059
This mandate is clear, God has graciously provided

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.459
for us in each gospel and also in the book of Acts,

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.579
a record of this mandate.

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:07.379
In each gospel and in the book of Acts,

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:09.459
it's not said exactly the same way,

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.319
but the content, the idea of the mission

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:14.179
is clearly communicated.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:16.739
We'll look here in Matthew's gospel, Matthew 28.

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:18.899
It's a text of scripture that we're familiar with.

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:21.559
In Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20,

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:24.339
we'll start in verse 18 down through verse number 20.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:28.259
Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:32.219
Notice as we are looking here to note the mission,

00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:34.299
why do we even have this conversation?

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:35.739
Why do we even deal with this?

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:38.299
Well, because Christ has left us,

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:40.259
his people, with a mission.

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:41.499
He's given us a command.

00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:42.419
It says in verse 18,

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:44.839
"'And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:48.099
"'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:10:48.099 --> 00:10:50.639
"'Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations,

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.719
"'baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.379
"'and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:56.639
"'teaching them to observe all things

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:58.679
"'whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.979
"'And lo, I am with you always,

00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:03.359
"'even unto the end of the world.

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:04.319
"'Amen.'"

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:06.599
And so we find that this often we'll refer to

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.119
as being the great commission.

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:09.879
This is Matthew's record.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.919
Again, each gospel, the book of Acts

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:15.439
can carry in those books this mission,

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:17.919
this mandate that God has given to us.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:21.119
And it's really not confusing.

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:22.879
It's very straightforward.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.119
The responsibility that has been given

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:26.339
to the people of God.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.180
We must understand this evening

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.259
that God did not commission us,

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:33.500
nor when we go out, do we have the perspective

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.180
that we're trying to quote unquote force

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.379
our beliefs on other people.

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:41.619
There are times that we're charged with that,

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:43.319
we're accused of.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:46.059
You're just trying to force your beliefs on other people.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.379
I'm not trying to force my beliefs on anybody.

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:49.739
Listen, when I knock on doors,

00:11:49.739 --> 00:11:51.519
if you've ever gone door knocking with me,

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.019
when I talk to people in a community,

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.739
if you've ever been around me when I do it,

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:56.299
I knock on the door, somebody comes to the door

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.419
and they say, hey, we're not interested.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.779
I say, hey, listen, have a great day.

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:00.659
I'm not mad at them.

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:01.619
I don't argue with them.

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:03.019
I don't attack them.

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:06.220
I don't tell, no, I just, hey, have a great day.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.179
Would you at least take this and read it later

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:09.679
at your convenience?

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:11.380
Sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say,

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.380
nope, I don't want it.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.059
Okay, have a great day.

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:15.779
I'm not trying to force our beliefs on anybody.

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:19.759
We believe this evening in individual soul liberty.

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.699
We believe that every single person is a Bible truth.

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:26.580
It is a staple of our doctrine

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.259
that we believe every individual has a right

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.220
to believe whatever they want.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.259
We don't believe in conversion by the sword.

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:38.220
We don't believe that you can force a personal choice

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.899
upon anyone to, you know, it's just not something we believe.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:45.300
It is an individual person's decision.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.259
With that individual soul liberty

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:51.679
comes individual responsibility and accountability.

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.800
They're responsible and they're accountable

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.080
for what they believe, what they choose to believe,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.880
what they reject and what they receive.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.720
They're responsible for that.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.440
I'm responsible for seeking to try to give them the truth,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.639
but it is not my job, nor is it your job

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:11.639
to force our teaching or our beliefs upon anyone.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.880
Now, not every people group, not every denomination

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.559
under the broad term of Christendom

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:23.239
has that same philosophy, all right?

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:25.440
They just don't believe that.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.039
And this evening, we believe

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.360
that Christ has given us a mission,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.639
but remember that Jesus said,

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.479
hey, if they don't listen to you,

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:38.039
shake off the dust and go to the next place, right?

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:38.880
It's not my job.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.839
Listen, I've sat, I've been in,

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:43.720
when I was in Bible college and other seminars

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.160
that I've gone to, I've heard people give statements

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.720
with regard to how you continue

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.080
to try to engage the person

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.559
after they tell you they're not interested

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.800
and you stick your foot in their door

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.279
and you do this and you do that.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.160
That's just, it's just not smart.

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:00.440
I almost said something different.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.279
It's just not smart.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.539
It really isn't.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.199
Why?

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:11.080
Because it's not being forced upon.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.759
Do you know this evening that if you force somebody

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:16.799
to say, quote unquote, a sinner's prayer,

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:19.279
that the likelihood of them truly being converted

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.839
is very low?

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:23.880
You can't force it.

00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:26.639
It's an individual choice.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.799
You can't force your kids to be saved.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:32.200
You can't force any other person to be saved.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.679
We're not trying to force beliefs on anyone.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:38.459
We're simply understanding the mission

00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:41.279
that God has given to us

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:45.339
and we're seeking to fulfill that mission effectively

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:47.139
and consistently.

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.660
As a church, we have a responsibility.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.019
Why do we have Saturday outreach?

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.179
Why is it that we're seeking to do that?

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.980
You say, I can reach people throughout the week.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.579
You should.

00:14:58.579 --> 00:14:59.419
You should.

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:00.940
When you go throughout your week,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.100
you should be actively carrying gospel tracts with you

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.940
and seizing the opportunities that God would give you

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.059
to be a witness, to be his representative

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:12.220
in your neighborhood, in your workplace,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.339
wherever God would give you an opportunity.

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:18.019
The reality, however, is that as a church,

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:20.059
so somebody says, well, I do that during the week

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:22.239
so I don't have to come on Saturday.

00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:24.220
I'm not saying that you have to come on Saturday,

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.820
but I want you to understand why is it

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.019
that we have an organized outreach program.

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:32.779
As a church, God has put us in this community

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:35.139
to be a light in this community.

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:37.000
Amen, he's placed us here.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.600
I've said often, you're never gonna find a missionary

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.799
on our missions board to Oakton, Virginia,

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:44.519
to Fairfax, Virginia, why?

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:48.440
Because God has placed us as his representatives,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.040
his missionaries, if you will, in Oakton, in Fairfax.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.119
And we should strategically and systematically

00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:59.399
reach our community, our Jerusalem,

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:02.679
with the doctrine, with the gospel, right?

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:05.720
So if we're not taking and strategically

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.959
and systematically reaching our community,

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:12.320
our Jerusalem, with the truth of God's word,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.239
with the gospel, then the reality is that you and I,

00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:19.600
we may never come into contact with the guy

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.859
that lives a half a block from here.

00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:26.119
We may never cross paths with that individual.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.079
With the people, listen, when I first got here

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:30.519
and started knocking doors, there was somebody,

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.359
Manuel and Maria, a neighbor of yours.

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:33.880
I doubt that they still live there.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.100
Two doors from where you currently live.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.320
I knocked on their door.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.040
Joseph was with me as my partner,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.000
and we knocked on their door, and they argued with me

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
for about 10 minutes that there's no church

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.179
on Oakton Road.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:50.480
I mean, they were absolutely adamant.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.600
I drive the road every day.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.880
I go to work that way.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.000
I come home that way.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.639
There is no church on Oakton Road.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:00.600
It was like they were accusing me of lying.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.559
And it was really kind of an interesting conversation.

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:05.239
And so, Ron, I tried to get creative,

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:06.760
and here's what I said at the end of the conversation.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.959
I was like, listen, are you gonna go to work on Monday?

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:09.799
And they said, yes.

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.799
I said, how about this?

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.919
When you go to work on Monday,

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:15.040
about a half mile up the road,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.959
when you turn onto Oakton Road, look to the right.

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:18.279
There's a little church, white church

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.320
that sits up on the hill.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.700
And if it's there, will you come on Sunday?

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.959
And they said, well, I'm not gonna say that.

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.079
And I'm like, well, come on, you know?

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.440
And the reality is that, listen, we have neighbors.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.720
Now, we live here now, and we've actively tried

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.639
to reach some neighbors.

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:38.200
We just have a brand new neighbor that moved in yesterday.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.000
The moving truck was there yesterday.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.600
So we're gonna purpose to go over there

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.160
and we're gonna try to take them a meal,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.639
but not to think that we're poisoning them, right?

00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:49.559
We live in a weird day.

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.600
25 years ago, a new person moves on the block.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.200
Like, it's great to bring them an apple pie,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.839
and like, hey, welcome to the neighborhood.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:57.399
Today, people look at you like you're crazy.

00:17:57.399 --> 00:17:59.480
And so it's a different era that we're living in,

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.940
but we wanna reach these people

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.040
because we have a responsibility.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.239
So as a church, how are we gonna reach our community

00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:09.000
and be purposed in it?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.119
We have to understand and know the mission.

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:14.359
Number two, consider your motivation.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:17.160
I believe this is an important foundational truth.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.919
When we talk about this idea of being fishers of men,

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.540
what is our motivation?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.760
I would say this.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.760
Our primary motivation must be obedience to God

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.859
and love for God.

00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:33.679
That is our primary motivation.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:39.739
Our secondary motivation can be the condition of mankind.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.900
But if we get that out of order, we get messed up.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.900
If our primary motivation is the condition of mankind,

00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:54.539
they reject you, they call you whatever,

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:56.479
they yell at you, they call the police on you,

00:18:56.479 --> 00:18:59.340
whatever they do, all of a sudden,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.380
your motivation's gonna dwindle quickly.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:06.020
Because your motivation is people.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.580
When your motivation, purely speaking,

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.219
you have pure motives that my motivation

00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:14.559
is out of obedience to God and love for God.

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.380
That's why I wanna go and tell people

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.619
about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:19.080
That's why I wanna share the gospel.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.979
Note this in John 14, in verse 15,

00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:23.619
we're familiar with the verse of scripture,

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:27.460
but it says, if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.299
Right, if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:32.179
We understand the commandment that's been given,

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:34.779
and so if we love him, we're to keep his commandments,

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:38.299
and this, no doubt, must be the primary motivation

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:40.020
for all that we do in life.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.260
I've mentioned this in previous messages,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.260
the idea of the audience of one,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.739
the fact that all that we do is for the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:47.739 --> 00:19:50.260
It's out of love for him and obedience to him

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.099
and to his word that we do what we do as believers.

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:59.099
I am thankful this evening that my involvement

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.260
in our.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.420
reach, my involvement in trying to share the gospel with someone else, your involvement

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.180
with trying to share the gospel with someone else has zero to do with your position as

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.940
being a child of God.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.340
We can't work our way to heaven, amen?

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.980
It's just not something we can do.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.540
And we understand that biblically salvation is all Christ, Christ alone.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.540
So I don't go and try to share the gospel with someone so that I can be saved, so that

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:34.820
I can go to heaven, no, we do it out of love for God and obedience to God.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.900
It's important for us to understand that, that's our motivation.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.780
I remember having a conversation with an individual and through the conversation they kept pushing

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.940
back but they stayed open and it was kind of an interesting dialogue and through that

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.660
conversation and interaction with that individual, at one point I finally looked at them and

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.460
I said this, listen, I'm going to heaven whether you do or not.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.180
I've been saved by the blood of Christ.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.860
I am heaven bound.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.700
The deal is that I would like for you to go to heaven when you die because I understand,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.220
I've read Revelation 20.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.860
Have you read Revelation 20?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.260
The scene of the great white throne judgment is not a pleasant scene in Revelation 20 verses

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.900
11 through 15.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:23.540
It's a sad scene and the reality is that I've read that so I understand where lost man will

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:29.340
spend eternity according to what God's word says and so therefore I want this person to

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.060
go to heaven but I'm going to heaven whether they do or don't.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.540
Whether they accept the message or not, I'm going to heaven, amen?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.980
But I want them to go to heaven.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.620
But my primary motivation can't be I want them to go to heaven, it's that I want to

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:51.900
obey Christ and it's important for us to understand that because if we get it in reverse order,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.940
it will be short-lived.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.940
It'll be short-lived.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.260
Why?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.700
Because rejection after rejection after rejection after rejection, you're going to say what's

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.820
the point?

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.260
No one wants to hear me.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.260
No one cares.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.260
No one listens.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.260
No one does.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.260
No, no, no.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:14.500
If my primary motivation is obedience to God, love for my Savior, then I can keep going

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.500
and keep being faithful even if the rejections come.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.500
Notice in Romans chapter 9 as we mentioned the secondary motivation is no doubt the condition

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.820
of mankind.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:33.460
Notice what Paul says in Romans 9.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:40.300
In Romans chapter number 9, in verse number 1, the Bible says this, I say the truth in

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.620
Christ I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:52.780
He briefly says that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart, for I could

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:58.700
wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700
the flesh.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.980
He says this in chapter 10 in verse number 1, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:08.380
to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:14.260
He says later on in that passage, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.260
be saved.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.620
See, Paul was concerned for the condition of mankind.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:25.460
He had, as he says in chapter 9, great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:32.140
He desired for the people that he knew, that he understood were his kinsmen according to

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:38.780
the flesh, his brethren as he refers to them, that they needed to be saved.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:45.100
And so it is a true motivation for individuals to understand that the condition of mankind,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.180
but it's a secondary motivation.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.860
The reality this evening is that everyone that you come in contact with is going to

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.900
spend somewhere forever.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:01.980
They're going to be somewhere forever, every person that you come in contact with.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.380
And when we truly understand, I wonder how many of us have this type of heart that Paul

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:15.100
does that I have a great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:22.180
That great white throne judgment is going to be a sad situation.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.619
Death and hell are cast into the lake of fire.

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:30.619
This is the second death, verse 15 of Revelation 20.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:38.540
There's no opportunity to, well, I want to accept now, no, it's too late.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.580
I've often said from the truth of Philippians that the reality is it's a matter of if not

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:50.220
when, or excuse me, when not if, I got that reversed.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.460
When you confess that Jesus is Christ makes all the difference.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.460
You will.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.260
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.260
Because if you make that confession on this side of death, you'll spend eternity with

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.740
Christ in heaven.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.180
But on the other side of death, you'll spend eternity in the lake of fire.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.059
And so we understand the condition of mankind, but the reality is that we must be focused

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:18.020
and understand what our true motivation is, and our true primary motivation must be obedience

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.260
to God and love for Christ.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.260
That's our motivation.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.740
Why do you do what you do?

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:29.180
You know, so often we can be asked that question, we can think about the subject matter of motives.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.260
There are people, no doubt, that judge other people's motives.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.140
There are people that, unfortunately, do not even examine their own motives with regard

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.900
to various aspects of ministry.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.300
Why do you play an instrument?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.100
Why do you sing a song?

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.020
Why do you teach a class?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.300
Why do you go and share the gospel with someone else?

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.040
Why do you pass out tracts?

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.779
Why do you give to church?

00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:59.900
Why do you…all of those things that we could ask ourselves this evening, there must be

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:08.619
a pure motive of singular truth that I do it out of obedience and love for my God.

00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:10.779
It must be the case.

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:17.300
And this evening, that is true with regard to the situation of being a fisher of men,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.660
that I must understand, consider what is my motivation.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.380
I would say this, number three, this evening, as we kind of wrap up this first introductory

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:31.140
kind of foundational message with regard to going and trying to reach people with the

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.020
gospel, number three, make it personal.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020
Make it personal.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.779
I'm going to deal with that from two perspectives.

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:43.779
Number one, that you understand your personal responsibility to share the gospel.

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:48.020
There are some people, unfortunately, throughout the years, throughout the centuries that have

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:54.779
had the idea that it's only the job of, quote-unquote, a full-time pastor, evangelist, missionary,

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.900
whatever, to share the gospel.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.660
But the reality is that this responsibility has been given to every one of God's children.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:07.420
If you're saved this evening by the grace of God, then you have been given a personal

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.260
responsibility to be His representative.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.740
And so when I talk about making it personal, we must understand personally, listen, there

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.980
are some, like, I'm not going to go to a church that doesn't, you know, have an outreach

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.980
program.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.980
I mean, I don't intend to participate in the outreach program, but I'm not going to go

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.140
to a church that doesn't have one.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.700
You understand what I'm saying?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:35.140
And the reality is that somewhere along the line, we must understand the personal aspect

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.420
of this mission that's been given.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:43.300
As a church, we talk about a church as made up of individuals that have been saved by

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.260
the grace of God, that have been baptized scripturally, that have joined themselves

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:55.220
together, voluntarily joined themselves together for the purpose of carrying out the gospel.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.660
That's our job.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.180
That's our duty.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.779
That's our responsibility.

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:01.540
And we must take it personal.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.740
And here's the amazing thing.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:08.059
When we take it personal and we begin to go and try to reach the people that God would

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:16.180
bring into our sphere of influence, it's amazing how God blesses them and how God works

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.420
through that.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.180
And so this evening, we talk about making it personal, understanding my personal responsibility,

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.580
but then also make it personal, meaning tell your story.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.220
If you've been saved tonight, you have a story, you have a testimony.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.220
If you've been saved tonight, you have a testimony.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.859
Can I tell you this evening that you know your testimony better than anyone else?

00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:43.540
You know your testimony better than anyone else.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.940
Would you agree with that?

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.220
Now there might be somebody else that has heard you give your testimony that may be

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:55.260
able to share aspects of your testimony and be able to share when it was that maybe your

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.260
spouse or your children, when they got saved, and you might be able to share some things.

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:04.299
But the reality this evening is that you know your story best.

00:29:04.299 --> 00:29:05.700
You know your story.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.000
You know what God did in your life.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.020
You know what God was doing leading up to that moment of conversion in your own life.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:20.700
You know how he delivered you and how he gave you a peace and a joy and a purpose that you

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.419
didn't have before.

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:27.340
And without regard of how old you were when you got saved, the reality is that if you're

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.540
saved, you have a testimony.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:36.179
There are some people that have the perspective that, well, my testimony isn't as good as

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.179
their testimony.

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:39.179
Nonsense.

00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:40.179
Nonsense.

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:42.540
You know why I say that's nonsense?

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.100
Because there's not one of us this evening that's the hero of our story.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.140
All of us have something consistent in our story.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.619
You know what it is?

00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:52.739
Christ is the hero of our story.

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:53.739
Amen?

00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:57.540
Well, I didn't live a life of sin.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.220
Thank God that you didn't live a life of sin.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.720
Because I can guarantee you, the people that are in the auditorium this evening,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.220
people that you come in contact with that have lived a life of sin before they got saved,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:15.220
they would stand and say, I wish I did not have to live that life of sin.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.220
I wish I didn't have all that baggage and all of that.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.220
Your story is powerful.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.220
It's personal, but it's also powerful.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.220
No one can tell your story like you can tell your story.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.220
Because you know it best.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.220
And when you begin to take it personal,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.220
and you begin to share with someone what God was doing in your life,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.220
and how He changed your life, listen, I often,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.220
I've learned this a number of years ago,

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.220
I often, as I try to talk to people about the Lord,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.220
whether it's door to door or whatever other avenue or arena God would give me,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.220
I often try to deal with it this way.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.220
I say, listen, can I tell you what Christ did for me?

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.220
Can I tell you how He changed my life?

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.220
I mean, it would just take a few minutes to share with you what He did for me

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.220
and how He changed my life.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.220
You know, oftentimes people are interested to hear a story.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.220
People will listen.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.220
Listen, if I'm just trying to get them to come to church,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.220
if I'm just trying to get them to,

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.220
man, they've gone to church, they know church,

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.220
they have, as soon as you say to somebody,

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.220
hey, I just want to invite you to come to our church,

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.220
do you know that immediately they have a thought in their mind what church is like?

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.220
Immediately.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.220
Whether that's a bad experience or a good experience,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.220
whatever the experience is, they have immediately

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:39.220
a thought in their mind with regard to what church is.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.220
And if they have some level of affiliation to church,

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.220
why do I need to go to your church?

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.220
I go to my church.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.220
I mean, I don't go often. I kind of haven't been there for a while.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.220
I often will ask people, and I don't mean to embarrass them,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.220
but when they say, oh, yeah, I go to church, I go all the time, that's wonderful.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.220
What's your pastor's name?

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.220
Oh, man.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.220
It's such a complicated name, I just can't remember it.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.220
And it just makes me laugh inside, right?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.220
I'm not trying to necessarily put them on the spot.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.220
I'm just trying to find out what's going on

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.220
and what the certainty is with regard to their position.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.220
And so here, when I make it personal

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.220
and I'm going through the process of telling my story,

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.220
not only is it personal, but it's powerful.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.220
And here's the thing.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.220
You should work on being able to share your story.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.220
You should work on it.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.220
If I could tonight give you a homework assignment,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.220
and this isn't school, so I can't,

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.220
if I could make a suggestion,

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.220
if you don't already have a way in which you could

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.220
in just a few minutes share your story,

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.220
your testimony of salvation,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.220
would I encourage you to work on that?

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.220
Work on it with your spouse.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.220
Maybe with your children.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.220
You know, it's important from time to time

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.220
for us to kind of just share our testimony.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.220
Share our personal story,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.220
our testimony of what God has done in our lives.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.220
I've been in settings, I've been in situations

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.220
where I've said, hey, let's share our testimonies.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.220
In fact, this happened in Holly's family

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.220
at Christmas a few years ago.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.220
They wanted to start out by just mom and dad boys

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.220
sharing their testimony of salvation

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.220
and what God did in their life.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.220
And they shared it, and it was great.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.220
It was a good time.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.220
Now, it's a big family.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.220
They're like 38 people, man.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.220
It's like a little church.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.220
I'm being serious.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.220
It's like a little church.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.220
And mom and dad boys share their testimony,

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.220
and then it felt like as the Lord was really in that thing

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.220
that, well, why don't we have our children

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.220
share their testimony?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.220
Actually, I think it started

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.220
with the sons and sons-in-laws.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.220
Let's have the heads of the families,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.220
let's have them share their testimony of salvation.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.220
And so there are seven,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.220
so we all start sharing our testimonies.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.220
And then it was like, well, why don't the ladies

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.220
share their testimony?

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.220
And then what about the teenagers that are old enough?

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.220
Why don't they start sharing their testimony?

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.220
And you know that through that process,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:05.220
one of the grandchildren that was old enough

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.220
realized they didn't have a testimony.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.220
They realized that they weren't saved.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.220
They couldn't share a testimony.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.220
You know, just a short time later,

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.220
they trusted Christ as their Savior.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.220
What a blessing.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.220
And sometimes it's an opportunity to share,

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.220
but if you say, I don't even know what I would say,

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.220
then work on it.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.220
Figure out how you can share your testimony,

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.220
how you can share it personally and powerfully,

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:36.220
because again, you're not the hero of your story.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.220
The Lord is the hero of your story.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.220
Sometimes I know people will use that phraseology,

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220
I found him.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.220
You didn't find him, he found you.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220
Amen?

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.220
He found me.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.220
He loved me.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.220
I didn't love him.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.220
He first loved me.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.220
I was his enemy.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.220
But he loved me.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.220
And he was gracious.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.220
And listen, for me personally,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.220
I had the opportunity to hear the gospel many, many times

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.220
before I ever trusted Christ as my Savior.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:08.220
I wish tonight I would have trusted Christ as my Savior

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.220
the first time I ever heard the gospel.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.220
But I didn't.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.220
But you have a story.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.220
Let me show you a couple of passages of Scripture.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220
Turn to the book of John, if you will.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.220
We'll look at two passages and then be done this evening.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.220
John chapter number 4.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220
As soon as I mention John chapter 4,

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.220
many of us are familiar with the text.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.220
We understand the woman at the well.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.220
And what a great passage of Scripture it is.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.220
I don't really want to deal with the interaction

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.220
between Jesus and the woman.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.220
I want to look at the woman and her story.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.220
As we deal with this idea of making it personal,

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.220
notice in John chapter number 4, look in verse number 28.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.220
The Bible says this.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.220
The woman then left her water pot.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.220
By the way, why was she there?

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.220
To get water.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.220
She went back without her water pot.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220
Why?

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.220
Because something better happened than getting some water.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.220
Amen?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.220
I mean, this was transforming for her.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.220
It was absolutely amazing for her.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.220
And the Bible says that she left her water pot

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.220
and went her way into the city and saith to the men.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.220
Notice what she says.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.220
Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.220
Is not this the Christ?

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.220
Then they, that's the people that she shared her story with,

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.220
went out of the city and came unto him.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.220
Isn't that precious?

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.220
It's powerful.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.220
All she did, I mean, listen, her message recorded in Scripture,

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.220
her message was not very lengthy.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.220
It wasn't very theological.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220
She didn't have all that.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.220
She just said, come and see a man.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.220
And what does she say about this man that she is telling them to,

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.220
inviting them to come see, which told me all things that ever I did.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.220
And then she says this.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.220
Is not this the Christ?

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.220
Why did she have that perspective?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.220
Well, just a few verses earlier, Jesus said,

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.220
I that speak unto thee am he.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:10.220
She understood that Jesus, the man, the God-man,

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.220
this individual that met her that day, was the Christ, Messiah.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.220
What a joy.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.220
She goes to those people in the city and she offers an invitation,

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.220
and the Bible says that they went out of the city and came unto him.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.220
Now, he obviously is going to talk to the disciples there

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.220
because as she leaves, they arrive.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.220
And notice in verse number 38, the Bible says,

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.220
I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.220
Other men labored and you entered into their labors.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.220
It's finishing up with the disciples in verse 39.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.220
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.220
Notice what this says.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.220
For the saying of the woman which testified,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:57.220
he told me all that ever I did.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.220
Many, I don't know how many,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.220
but many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.220
Isn't that wonderful?

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.220
All because she made a decision to go tell a personal story,

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.220
a personal testimony.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:15.220
All because she took and said, come, see a man.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.220
Is not this the Christ?

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.220
He told me everything I've ever done.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.220
And we find that these people responded to the invitation

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.220
and there were many that believed.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.220
Now, the Bible says in verse number 40,

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.220
so when the Samaritans were come unto him,

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.220
they besought him that he would tarry with them,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.220
and he abode there two days.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.220
And many more believed because of his own word.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.220
And said unto the woman, now we believe not because of thy saying,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.220
for we have heard him ourselves and know that this indeed,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.220
or that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.220
But I want you to understand that because of the interaction,

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.220
listen, she still was part of that whole thing.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.220
She's still part of it.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.220
Your testimony this evening is powerful.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.220
Take it personally.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.220
Make it personal.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.220
Notice in John chapter nine,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.220
I referenced quickly this morning,

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.220
this portion of Scripture with regard to the religious leaders at the end

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.220
saying, are we blind also?

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.220
But I want to draw your attention just for a moment

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.220
to this man that was born blind.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.220
The Bible introduces us in verse number one of chapter nine.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:31.220
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.220
And this man, through a miracle that took place,

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.220
Jesus tells him to go wash in the pool of Siloam

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.220
and he came seeing according to verse number seven.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:48.220
And oh, what a scene unfolds in John chapter nine.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.220
All the religious leaders and calling for the parents

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.220
and all that takes place.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.220
And we find that this man, after being asked many times,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.220
in verse number 25,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.220
they called again.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.580
And according to verse number 24,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.740
then again called they the man that was blind

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.420
and said unto him, give God the praise.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.860
We know that this man is a sinner.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.620
They're talking about Christ being a sinner.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.100
No, he's the sinless, perfect Lamb of God.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.080
He's God in flesh.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.060
But they called him again.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.460
And it's almost, if I could read into the text

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.020
just a little bit this evening,

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.540
it's almost like he was overwhelmed and frustrated

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.140
with another line of questioning,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.660
like he's being asked this again.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.660
And notice in verse 25, he answered and said,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.140
whether he be a sinner or no, I know not.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.140
One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.500
Then said they to him again, what did he to thee?

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.760
How opened he thine eyes?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.300
We find that it says he answered them,

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.240
I have told you already and you did not hear,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.980
wherefore would you hear it again?

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.940
Will you also be his disciples?

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.140
Now that didn't go over very well.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.980
That was a real problem for these religious leaders, right?

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.980
That was not well received.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.060
But can you see almost as being frustrated,

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.660
like why are you still asking me?

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.780
But I wanna just draw your attention to verse 25.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.380
He says, look, I don't know how to answer all your questions

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:15.140
but one thing I know, I was blind and now I see.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.060
Can I tell you that this miracle is still being talked about

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.660
at the end of chapter number 10?

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.220
It's still being talked about.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.060
Excuse me, the end of chapter 11.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.860
In chapter 11, the situation with Nicodemus,

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.380
I know I said chapter 10, sorry, chapter 11.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.260
The end of the chapter, the Jews that are there,

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.860
they say in verse 37, those that were mourning

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.140
because of the death of Lazarus,

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.640
could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.700
have caused that even this man should not have died.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.580
This was an impactful miracle in John chapter number nine.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.940
But this man stands, he says, look,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.540
I can't answer all your questions

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.300
but this one thing I can tell you,

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.820
I was blind and now I see.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.460
We understand that that was a physical condition.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.580
He then later in the text of scripture

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.180
understands who Jesus is.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.660
Jesus comes back to him and at verse number 38,

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.180
he says, Lord, I believe and he worshiped him.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.940
What a joy.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.740
Listen, I want you to understand this evening,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.940
you may not be able to answer everyone's questions

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.380
but you really don't have to.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.180
Can I tell you, I have been asked

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.020
some crazy off the wall questions.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.580
I'm serious, man.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.140
I have been asked some questions that I'm like, where?

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.500
Like, what have you been watching?

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.900
I've never, if you like Star Wars or that stuff,

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.900
like I'm not criticizing you, I've just never watched it

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.340
and I really have zero desire to watch it

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.840
but I wonder sometimes as some people

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.860
come up with these questions, I'm like, man,

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.700
they've been watching Star Wars for so long,

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.980
they've been watching something, man.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.800
I don't know what they're watching

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.020
but they come up with all these weird scenarios

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.220
and hypotheticals and I don't even think

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.780
they believe what they're asking.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.420
They're just trying to derail you.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.300
They're just trying to detour you.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.620
They're trying to avoid the subject matter.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.020
There are many times I say, you know what,

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.140
that's a good question but can we deal with that later?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.020
Sometimes people want you to answer every theology question

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.600
that they can throw at you.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.820
I'm not suggesting that we should not be ready,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.760
as Peter says, to give an answer to every man

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.020
of the hope that lieth within us

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.500
but what I am suggesting this evening

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.780
is that we must have wisdom

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.140
and we must be able to stand before,

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.700
listen, sometimes what happens is God's people

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.340
feel inadequate because they think

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.860
I can't answer the questions that may be asked of me.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.040
Can I tell you that you can say like that blind man said,

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.320
I don't know but here's what I do know.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.860
I was lost and now I'm found.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.540
He said I was blind and now I see

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.320
but I'm speaking spiritually this evening.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.220
I was lost and now I'm found.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.100
I had no direction, I had no peace,

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.500
I had no joy, I had no confidence.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.660
In fact, the very thought of dying scared me.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.460
Terrified of the thought of dying.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.540
I had no idea what would happen

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:05.920
and then it terrified me even more

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.380
after I had been exposed to the gospel

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.540
and I knew what would happen if I died without Christ.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.340
I was miserable and then on that day

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.220
when God graciously saved my soul,

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.660
I haven't feared death.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.620
I have a joy that I can't really explain.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.400
I have a peace that I can't fully comprehend.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.260
Why?

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.700
Because he saved me, he changed my life.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.700
Can I tell you that sometimes being able to answer

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.660
all the crazy questions is actually more of a detriment?

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.940
Just gets you all in the weeds.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.500
Seriously, sidetracked on stuff

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.220
that absolutely has nothing to do with the gospel.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.300
With the gospel.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.500
We're trying to get people to, lost people,

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.860
as I mentioned this morning from 1 Corinthians 2.14,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.860
we're trying to get lost people, the natural man,

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.500
to understand spiritual things

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.100
before they've been born again.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.340
I've been guilty of it.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.900
Maybe you've been guilty of it as well.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.860
It's frustrating because you're trying to get a lost person

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.420
to understand a spiritual truth

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.620
that they can't fully understand until they're born again.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.700
Ye must be born again.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.500
We must understand the mission.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.100
God's given us this mission.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.040
We must have proper motivation.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.500
It's obedience to God, love for God.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.820
And it's imperative that we make it personal.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.340
It's my personal responsibility,

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.480
but it's also my personal testimony.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.020
This evening, if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.540
you have a testimony, you have a story.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:46.340
And your story is personal, but it's also powerful.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.660
And if you don't, if you've not practiced

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.020
on being able to share your testimony, share your story,

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.220
can I encourage you this week, share your story.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.100
Get with someone, talk to someone.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.420
If you wanna share your story with me,

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.640
many of you, if you're a member here,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.900
you've already shared your story with me

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.540
because you couldn't join the church if you didn't, amen.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.340
But what I'm saying is that, listen,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.580
it's good for us to be able to share our story.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.180
It shouldn't be awkward for you to share your story

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.580
because Christ is the hero of my story.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.540
And can I tell you what he did for me?

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.140
Can I tell you how he changed my life?

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.900
And it's amazing the open doors that God will provide.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.380
Fishers of Men, part one.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.860
Next week, we'll deal with another aspect of the how-to

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.920
and really getting into the nuts and bolts, if you will,

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.340
after we understand the foundation.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.260
Let's pray.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.100
Father, we love you.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.180
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.900
Thank you for the opportunity to be gathered this evening.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.300
Thank you for the freedom to worship you.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.180
Thank you for the freedom to go into our community,

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.260
to go into the marketplace, the workplace,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.420
wherever it is that we are,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.180
to have the freedom and the opportunity

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.580
to be able to be your representatives, your ambassadors.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.540
And God, I pray that you'd help us to be equipped.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.180
I pray, Lord, that you'd help us to have this understanding

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.740
of our personal testimony.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.900
Lord, if there's some here this evening

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.460
that just have never really thought about

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.500
or never developed and worked on

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.820
being able to share their testimony,

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.340
God, I pray that you'd help them this evening

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.220
to be able to put down the thoughts

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.300
and to bring into memory,

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.540
to be able to share with others

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.940
the great work that you did in their life

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.660
in saving their soul.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.700
I pray, God, that you'd bless the time of invitation.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.140
I pray that through all that's said and done

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.060
that you alone will be glorified and we'll thank you for it.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.060
In Christ's name we pray.
