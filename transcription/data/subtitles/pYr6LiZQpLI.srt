1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,279
some homework.

2
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:04,400
And that homework assignment from last Wednesday evening,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,239
what was it?

4
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,440
It was the homework assignment, who remembers?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,039
That means you didn't do it, amen.

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,119
I know some of you did,

7
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,119
because some of you contacted me about it.

8
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,960
Come on, help me out.

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,560
What was the homework assignment?

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,879
Right, the phrase one accord in the book of Acts.

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,000
And we're dealing with unity in the church,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
and I made the reference in the message

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,879
that that phrase one accord

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,559
is used repeatedly in the book of Acts.

15
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,200
Now, there are some times in the book of Acts

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,720
that it's used, and it's not really used

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,319
in a beneficial way as far as the church

18
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:40,319
being in one accord, but the opposition

19
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:42,799
of God's people being in one accord

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,840
against the man of God.

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,919
But I'm gonna read through the verses quickly.

22
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,159
If you jotted them down, if you did it,

23
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,240
if not, that's fine, but let's look at them.

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,959
Acts one and verse 14 is the first one.

25
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,119
And we're gonna go quickly through this,

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,439
and we're just gonna make the reference,

27
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,840
read it, and keep going on.

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,759
This isn't the lesson for tonight,

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,040
but I know some of you contacted me about it,

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,360
so I thought it would be important

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
for us to deal with this.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
In Acts one and verse 14, it says,

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,559
"'These all continued with one accord

34
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:15,699
"'in prayer and supplication with the women

35
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,239
"'and Mary, the mother of Jesus,

36
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,360
"'and with his brethren.'"

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,199
Chapter two and verse number one,

38
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:22,720
and when the day of Pentecost was fully come,

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,760
they were all with one accord in one place.

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,040
Chapter two and verse number 46, the Bible says,

41
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,660
"'And they, continuing daily with one accord

42
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,519
"'in the temple and breaking bread from house to house,

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,040
"'did eat their meat with gladness

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,400
"'and singleness of heart.'"

45
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,279
Chapter number four, if you turn over

46
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:48,980
in verse number 24 of chapter four, the Bible says,

47
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,720
"'And when they heard that,

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,959
"'they lifted up their voice to God with one accord

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,800
"'and said, Lord, thou art God,

50
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,099
"'which hast made heaven and earth and the sea

51
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,279
"'and all that in them is.'"

52
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:06,199
And chapter number five, and I know I'm going quickly.

53
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm just trying to reference through them quickly.

54
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,600
In chapter five and verse number 12, the Bible says,

55
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,919
"'And by the hands of the apostles

56
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,800
"'were many signs and wonders wrought among the people,

57
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,399
"'and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.'"

58
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,839
Now here's one that we see the phrase,

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,479
but it's not of God's people being of one accord.

60
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,720
In chapter seven, in verse number 57,

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,119
after Stephen is preaching

62
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,919
and they're under great, deep conviction,

63
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,419
the Bible says that those enemies of the cross,

64
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,479
it says that, "'Then they cried out with a loud voice

65
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,479
"'and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord.'"

66
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,679
So we see that even the enemy at times will be in unity

67
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,240
against the cause of Christ,

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,440
and we see that reference there.

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,919
Of course, the idea of the challenge

70
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,320
was with regard to the people of God being in one accord.

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,600
Acts eight and verse number six,

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,440
the Bible says, "'And the people with one accord

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,199
"'gave heed unto those things which Philip spake,

74
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,220
"'hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.'"

75
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,100
In chapter number 12, it's a reference, again,

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,520
really not with regard to the people of God.

77
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
Peter had been in prison.

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,440
Remember in Acts 12, God worked miraculously

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,080
in getting Peter's out of prison,

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,800
and he's standing at the gate and he's knocking,

81
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,479
and they don't let him in immediately.

82
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,279
And of course, Herod's upset about this

83
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,759
because they can't find him,

84
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,759
and he examined the keepers of the prison and what have you.

85
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,960
And in verse number 20 of Acts 12, it says,

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,600
"'And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,300
"'but they came with one accord to him,

88
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,479
"'and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain,

89
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,839
"'their friend desired peace because their country

90
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,360
"'was nourished by the king's country.'"

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,759
Turn over to chapter 15, if you will, Acts 15,

92
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,619
and verse number 25, the Bible says,

93
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:03,559
"'It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord,

94
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,240
"'to send chosen men unto you

95
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,679
"'with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.'"

96
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,639
This is after the council at Jerusalem

97
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,919
and the decision that was made,

98
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,080
and they're talking about they're in unity

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,139
with regard to this.

100
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,600
Chapter 18 in verse number 12,

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,600
chapter 18 in verse number 12,

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,279
the Bible says, again, this really isn't a good reference

103
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,920
for us either, but it says,

104
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,480
"'And when Galileo was the deputy of Achaia,

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,920
"'the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul

106
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
"'and brought him to the judgment seat.'"

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,839
And then 19, Acts 19 in verse number 29,

108
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,679
the Bible says, "'And the whole city was filled

109
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,920
"'with confusion, and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus,

110
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,480
"'men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, in travel,

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,799
"'they rushed with one accord into the theater.'"

112
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,079
And so we see that there's a few references, again,

113
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,679
of the enemy being in unity against the cause of Christ,

114
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,640
but we do find that as we've referenced

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
through these very quickly this evening,

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,440
there's a number of references where God's people,

117
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,440
the early church, they were in one accord, they had unity.

118
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,760
The message last Wednesday evening, unity in the church,

119
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,480
and we dealt with that from verse Thessalonians 5,

120
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,559
the last portion of verse 13,

121
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,079
"'And be at peace among yourselves.'"

122
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,799
No wonder God was able to work so mightily

123
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,859
through the early church in the book of Acts,

124
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:36,239
as they were able to fill Jerusalem with their doctrine,

125
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:39,420
as they were able to turn the world upside down,

126
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,459
they were in one accord, they were in unity,

127
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,540
and God blessed and God worked.

128
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,260
And so I hope that was a blessing to you.

129
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,700
If you need some of those references,

130
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,480
maybe you didn't have all of them jotted down,

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,279
I'd be happy to provide them for you.

132
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,619
Now for the message this evening,

133
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:58,220
over in 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

134
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,619
as we continue studying through this portion of scripture,

135
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,940
or of course the last section of chapter five

136
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,739
of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

137
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,739
and then we'll get to the end of 2 Thessalonians

138
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:11,859
chapter number three, all part of the same study

139
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:16,859
that I have titled, Walk Worthy and Please God.

140
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:20,619
We find that, as I've mentioned in previous lessons

141
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:25,179
leading into the study, that really in both texts

142
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:29,739
of scripture, we find really this almost rapid fire

143
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:33,820
kind of instruction that is given to the local church.

144
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,579
And it continues here in the text of scripture.

145
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,220
And I want you to remember that the instruction

146
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,059
which is provided to a local church,

147
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,820
when followed, will enable the church

148
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,059
to walk worthy and please God.

149
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,700
Not only is it given to a local church,

150
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,899
the church in Thessalonica, but we also understand,

151
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,059
as we mentioned in our very first lesson,

152
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:57,260
that the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

153
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,899
It's a good church.

154
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,739
God is using that church in a mighty way,

155
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,940
but we find that God would lead the apostle Paul

156
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,140
to give this instruction to help them understand

157
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,459
how they should live and how they should behave

158
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,260
and how they should continue.

159
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,820
We made reference in verse number 12

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,500
to the phrase when he said, we beseech you.

161
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,299
But we also see now, as we enter into verse number 14,

162
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:26,540
that Paul says, now we exhort you.

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,660
And so we see that he uses the phraseology

164
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,220
that we beseech you and now we exhort you.

165
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,579
And so we see this instruction that's given

166
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,179
and we find really in verses 14 and 15

167
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:40,299
that there are five specific instructions

168
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,420
that are given in these two verses of scripture.

169
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,779
Now my plan is to deal with one piece of instruction

170
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,260
each service.

171
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,179
I try to keep the lessons on Wednesday evening shorter

172
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,299
so that we have time for prayer.

173
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,980
At the end of our services, it is our prayer meeting

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,220
and I believe that God hears and answers prayer

175
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,859
and I think corporate prayer,

176
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,059
how many references of one accord

177
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,820
was how they were in one accord in prayer

178
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,940
when they lifted up their voice in one accord, right?

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,260
And so we find that it's important that we have that.

180
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,420
So we'll look at each of these individual statements

181
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,339
that are given or words of instruction

182
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,859
and as we examine them, seeking to apply them again

183
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,500
so that we might walk worthy and please God.

184
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,559
So I'll read both verse 14 and 15.

185
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,059
The Bible says this, now we exhort you, brethren.

186
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,339
Warm them that are unruly.

187
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,500
Comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,

188
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,739
be patient toward all men.

189
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,500
See that none render evil for evil unto any man,

190
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,419
but ever follow that which is good,

191
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,840
both among yourselves and to all men.

192
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,460
This evening, if you're taking notes,

193
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,539
the title is just that first phrase there

194
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,659
after he says, we exhort you, brethren.

195
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,140
The title for the lesson tonight

196
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,619
is warn them that are unruly.

197
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,900
Warn them that are unruly.

198
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,299
If you're taking notes, number one, the problem.

199
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,659
The problem is addressed here in verse number 14.

200
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,659
What is the problem?

201
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,580
Well, there's some people that are unruly.

202
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,619
And so we find that here,

203
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:14,260
because of there being a group of people,

204
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,320
doesn't matter the size of the group,

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,659
he uses warn them, so plural.

206
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,419
It's not warn him or her.

207
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,500
It's a plural use of the word.

208
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,580
And so therefore, there's some level of people

209
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,859
that would be in this category of being unruly.

210
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,619
And so we see that as a problem.

211
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:35,900
We do not know who these individuals are specifically.

212
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,979
Their names are not given to us,

213
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,500
nor do we understand exactly the way

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,020
in which they are being unruly.

215
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,179
God doesn't give us that information.

216
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,460
We find that he simply says, warn them that are unruly.

217
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,219
And so we see the problem that is being addressed here

218
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,580
in the text of scripture.

219
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,219
It is of interest that the word unruly,

220
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,979
this is the only time that this Greek word is used

221
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,579
all of the New Testament.

222
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,579
And this word, it literally means to be disorderly.

223
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,539
Often it would be used of soldiers that were out of rank.

224
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:12,539
And those of you that have served in the military

225
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,459
and you would understand that structure

226
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,859
of rank and responsibility,

227
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:20,779
and it would often be used in that context.

228
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,019
It carries with it the idea of deviating

229
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,979
from the prescribed order or rule.

230
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,259
And so we find that they would deviate.

231
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,179
There were some that were unruly.

232
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,219
The reality is that as this piece of instruction,

233
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,459
this exhortation is given to the church at Thessalonica,

234
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,379
we understand that there are some there in Thessalonica

235
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,539
that are unruly.

236
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,239
But I would say to you this evening

237
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,739
that as the portion of scripture,

238
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:52,979
as this book of scripture has been preserved,

239
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,219
so that not only the church at Thessalonica

240
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,419
could walk worthy and please the Lord,

241
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,299
but so that every local church that has the Bible

242
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,939
would have this instruction

243
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,379
so that they too could walk worthy and please God,

244
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,459
I would say this evening that there is an obvious

245
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,699
revelation that is given to us

246
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:15,219
that the reality is that there will always be some

247
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,859
who are unruly.

248
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:17,899
Now here's the reality.

249
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,419
I don't wanna be part of the group that's the unruly.

250
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:24,219
And I hope, it's almost like this.

251
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:27,219
If you have to ask if I'm part of the unruly,

252
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,419
chances are you might be, you know what I mean?

253
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:32,199
You kinda can kinda figure that out.

254
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,739
But we find that there's some there in the church

255
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:36,939
that are unruly.

256
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:39,539
Now it's interesting because we find that

257
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,559
even in the lesson from last week,

258
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,539
when he said be at peace among yourselves,

259
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,259
the importance of unity,

260
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,579
we find that as we referenced even last week,

261
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,539
the church at Corinth, it was a church of divisions

262
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,019
and all of the contentions that were going on

263
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,939
and no doubt there were some in Corinth

264
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,499
that were unruly.

265
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:02,179
And it'd be easy for us to note that and acknowledge that

266
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,279
as you study through the book of 1 Corinthians.

267
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,139
But I think maybe as you read the book of 1 Thessalonians,

268
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,999
if you do not have this exhortation in verse number 14,

269
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,739
you might be led to believe that it was just a church

270
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,819
where everything was going perfectly well

271
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,219
and everyone was right in line.

272
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:21,319
But God says warn them that are unruly.

273
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,099
Warn them that are unruly.

274
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,019
Notice not only the problem,

275
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,019
we find that there are some there that are unruly,

276
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,419
the prescription.

277
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,179
What does God prescribe for these that are unruly?

278
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,899
Does he say excommunicate them?

279
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,659
I mean, get them out if they're unruly.

280
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,059
No, he says warn them, warn them.

281
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,259
By the way, I like that prescription.

282
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,459
Our God is a gracious God.

283
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,619
Our God is a long suffering God.

284
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,579
Our God is a God who wants his people to be informed.

285
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,539
He wants us to have the information.

286
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,719
He wants us to know how we can please him,

287
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,639
how we can walk worthy.

288
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,119
And so the admonition, the exhortation here,

289
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:03,159
the problem is addressed, but the prescription is given

290
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,199
that we are to warn them, a warning.

291
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,519
Now we all know what a warning is.

292
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,839
We also know that a warning can be ignored, right?

293
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,899
A warning can be ignored.

294
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,759
Let me say this about warnings.

295
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,919
I believe that warnings are good for us.

296
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,059
It's good to be warned.

297
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:25,179
You ever see a sign that has some warning,

298
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,619
a road sign about some danger that lies ahead?

299
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,499
I mean, how many times when we're driving,

300
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,979
we say that, well, no, we might be upset

301
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,099
that the bridge is out ahead

302
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,219
and we can't go the route that we wanted to go,

303
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:37,739
but we certainly appreciate the warning

304
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,779
that there was a bridge out ahead, right?

305
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,979
We don't get mad at the person that put the warning up

306
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,939
and say, I can't believe they would warn me.

307
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,019
No, you're just gonna go off the cliff and die.

308
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,219
No, the warning is good, right?

309
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:55,059
How many of you have cleaning supplies in your home?

310
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,619
On the back, there's some warning labels, right?

311
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:01,499
But we're familiar with warnings, we understand.

312
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:06,499
And here, we find that God says there's some people

313
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:10,219
that are categorized, that are described as being unruly,

314
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:13,339
and the prescription, what you do is you warn them.

315
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,859
I ask this question, how is it that we are to warn them?

316
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,779
Well, I believe very clearly

317
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,299
that we are to use the authoritative word of God.

318
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,259
It's God's word that gives the warning.

319
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,659
It is God's word that we use

320
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,699
when we're warning someone that is unruly.

321
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,139
We find, if you take your Bible,

322
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,539
turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 19,

323
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,859
we're gonna look at a number of verses of Scripture

324
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:39,379
in order to prove this point

325
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,299
with regard to the prescription and the process.

326
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,539
How many of you ever have gotten a prescription?

327
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,459
Come on, I know a bunch of you have gotten prescriptions,

328
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,339
amen, I've gotten prescriptions in my life.

329
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,939
What happens when they give you a prescription?

330
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,499
They tell you how to use it?

331
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,579
Yeah, is that what they do?

332
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,539
Not always, right?

333
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,779
I'm not talking about all the this might cause this

334
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,739
and this might be that, but they give you some words

335
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,419
of this is how you're supposed to use it.

336
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,859
Don't take it with this, make sure you have food,

337
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:10,499
so on and so forth, right?

338
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,379
And so we find that in Psalm 19,

339
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,899
how is it that these that are unruly are to be warned?

340
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,379
Well, the process in which we use to warn the unruly

341
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,499
is by going to God's authoritative word.

342
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,539
Notice, we won't take the time to read

343
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:29,179
verse seven through 10 of Psalm 19,

344
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,939
but if you look in that portion of Scripture,

345
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:33,619
it's quite obvious that he's dealing with God's word,

346
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,739
and he says this in verse number 11,

347
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:40,659
moreover, by them, speaking of the law of the Lord,

348
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,179
the statutes of the Lord, the judgments of the Lord,

349
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,659
so on and so forth, all the references that are given,

350
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,859
by them is thy servant, what does it say?

351
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:51,699
Warned.

352
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,899
By them, by God's word is thy servant warned,

353
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,659
and then notice this, and in keeping of them, God's word,

354
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,979
there is great reward.

355
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,139
You know what that reveals to me?

356
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,539
That reveals to me that when God gives us a warning,

357
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:10,379
that in keeping that warning and taking heed

358
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,139
to that warning, it's beneficial for us,

359
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,819
just like that warning on that poison

360
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,219
that says do not consume.

361
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:23,339
It's for your best interest that you do not consume

362
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,739
that particular product because it can cause great harm

363
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:30,899
or even death, and so we find this evening

364
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,899
that God says that his word is given to us,

365
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,859
and it warns his people, and in keeping of them,

366
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,419
God's word, there's great reward,

367
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:45,499
and so if we as a local body, if the church at Thessalonica,

368
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,659
if any other church throughout the era of the church

369
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,059
is going to have some that are unruly,

370
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,139
how is it that they warn the unruly?

371
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,979
They must use God's word.

372
00:16:56,979 --> 00:17:00,299
The process involves using the word of God.

373
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,339
Notice the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter number 20.

374
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,259
We see the truth in Psalm 19 of the way

375
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,059
that God's word would warn us,

376
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,539
but notice, if you will, in Acts chapter 20,

377
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,739
Paul makes a great statement here

378
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:18,739
with regard to the ministry in which he was involved with,

379
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,379
and when I think about this ministry

380
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,499
and I think about the text here,

381
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:26,059
we see the compassion of Paul.

382
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,859
Notice in verse 31 of Acts 20,

383
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,539
it says, therefore, watch and remember,

384
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:33,379
remember what?

385
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:34,899
That by the space of three years,

386
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:38,219
I cease not to warn everyone night and day.

387
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:42,779
You see those next two words with tears, with tears.

388
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,099
See, when someone is unruly,

389
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,459
it's not that we're warning them

390
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:51,379
because we're trying to bring the hammer down on them.

391
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,819
You know what I mean by that?

392
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:57,499
No, we're warning them because we want to see them respond

393
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:01,539
and obey, and we find here that Paul,

394
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,419
I believe contextually,

395
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,459
we could obviously say that he was preaching the gospel.

396
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:11,379
He was warning people about the penalty of their sin

397
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:13,019
and they needed to be born again,

398
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,299
but I believe that not only do we see the warning,

399
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,339
he says, everyone night and day with tears,

400
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,659
the warning of the lost

401
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,419
about the fact they need to be saved,

402
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,899
but also the warning of God's people

403
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,859
that they need to walk in obedience to the Lord,

404
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,579
and we find that he's warning them,

405
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,699
and he says that's part of the ministry

406
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,820
that he's involved with.

407
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,739
It's interesting, notice, continue looking

408
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,260
at the Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians chapter four,

409
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,099
and looking at his ministry and his behavior.

410
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,699
So he's writing to the church at Thessalonica

411
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,940
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

412
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,419
about warning them that are unruly,

413
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,699
but understand that Paul himself understood

414
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,699
the responsibility that God had entrusted him

415
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:58,419
to warn others during his ministry,

416
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,659
and how he was not only instructing a local church

417
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,299
to warn them that are unruly,

418
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,299
but he himself also had to do some warning

419
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,820
during his ministry.

420
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,579
By the way, it's not always great being on the side

421
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,619
of having to warn somebody else.

422
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,459
You know why?

423
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,099
They don't always respond well.

424
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,339
You know, sometimes you warn somebody

425
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:21,179
and they get mad at you, right?

426
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,099
It's just how it works.

427
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,339
It's unfortunate.

428
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,399
You wish everybody would respond well,

429
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,779
but it's just not the way it works,

430
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,619
and so we find here, notice in 1 Corinthians four,

431
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:33,099
Paul says this in verse number 14,

432
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:36,139
I write not these things to shame you,

433
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:41,139
but as my beloved sons, I warn you.

434
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,019
I warn you.

435
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,699
Now, we see in the context of 1 Corinthians,

436
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,619
Paul is writing to the church at Corinth,

437
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,739
a church that's made up of saved people, amen?

438
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,419
That's what makes a church,

439
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:57,219
is that you're a group of saved, baptized followers

440
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,500
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

441
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,299
He's writing to them, but he also.

442
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,299
says in the verse, as my beloved sons, I warn you.

443
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:10,059
Many of us in the room this evening have children.

444
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,679
No doubt we can understand that if we are to watch

445
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,139
our child do something that's going to cause them

446
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:19,499
great harm, that we warn them.

447
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,699
We warn them.

448
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,899
Why is it that we warn them?

449
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,219
Because we love them, right?

450
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:26,059
Because we love them.

451
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:30,579
We don't want them to consume or to participate,

452
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,419
partake of whatever the situation is,

453
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,279
whatever the circumstance is, and so we see it,

454
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,879
so we warn them, hey, hey, be careful, don't do that.

455
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,739
We understand that in life.

456
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,859
And so Paul says, I'm not writing these things to shame you,

457
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,579
I'm simply warning you, why?

458
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,099
Because there needs to be a change in the behavior,

459
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,899
ultimately, as we'll see in just a moment,

460
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,199
because you're gonna stand before God one day.

461
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,399
And so we find that he says that I'm warning you.

462
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,599
Notice in the book of Colossians, in chapter number one,

463
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,139
notice what Paul says here as he's writing to this church

464
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,599
in Colossae, a church that Paul did not start,

465
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,519
a church that is, best we can tell,

466
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,519
Paul never had any personal interaction with them

467
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,819
other than hearing about their salvation

468
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:17,279
and their spiritual growth and praying for them

469
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,039
and then writing to them.

470
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,279
And we find in Colossians one, in verse number 28,

471
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,719
notice how he describes his ministry that God has given.

472
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,199
It says, whom we preach, speaking about preaching Christ,

473
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:35,199
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

474
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,199
notice the ultimate goal, that we may present every man

475
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,879
perfect in Christ Jesus.

476
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,159
What does that word perfect mean?

477
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,759
It means, it carries the idea of being complete.

478
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,939
It does not mean that you'll never sin again,

479
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,859
it does not mean that you're gonna reach this place

480
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,419
of sinless perfection, it means that you'll be complete.

481
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,059
I'm thankful that one day we'll all be perfect,

482
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,579
but that's after we leave this world, amen?

483
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:03,979
I'm not gonna be perfect on this world and neither are you.

484
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:07,179
And that's just the way it is, but we can be complete

485
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,539
and Paul says, I'm warning and I'm teaching, why?

486
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,539
So that we might be able to present every man perfect

487
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,459
in Christ Jesus.

488
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:19,499
I'm not warning people to embarrass them, to shame them,

489
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,739
to ridicule them, to, you're always picking on me.

490
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,259
No, no, no, Paul says, it's because I want you

491
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,619
to be able to be complete in Christ.

492
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:31,859
And what a great heart, what a great perspective.

493
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:34,819
We notice, I'm not gonna turn there for sake of time,

494
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,979
we're familiar, of course, with the truth

495
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:40,059
of 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 16, where the Bible says

496
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,179
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

497
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,339
and it's profitable for doctrine and we always speak

498
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,179
about that, the importance of doctrine,

499
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,499
but the Bible doesn't stop there, it says for reproof,

500
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,419
for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

501
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,979
that the man of God might be perfect,

502
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:00,339
throughly furnished unto all good works.

503
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,299
And so we find, listen, at times in my life,

504
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,679
at times in your life, guess what?

505
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,719
We need some warning, there's some correction,

506
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:13,099
some instruction that's needed and God says here

507
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,539
in 1 Thessalonians chapter five in verse number 14,

508
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:21,539
he says, warn them that are unruly.

509
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,519
The problem is that there were some that were unruly.

510
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:28,839
The problem is one that's consistent amongst churches.

511
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,679
Why?

512
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,339
Because we're all human beings.

513
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,219
He says, warn them that are unruly.

514
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:36,659
He says, this is the problem, but here's the prescription,

515
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,299
warn them, how?

516
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,939
What is the process by which we use in order

517
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:43,899
to warn those that are unruly?

518
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,019
He tells them, listen, it's not a matter

519
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:47,219
of excommunication.

520
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,659
Now, we do find that at times it might become

521
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,399
church discipline matters.

522
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,239
By the way, church discipline isn't real popular in 2024,

523
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,859
but it's still biblical, amen?

524
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,859
And at times there might be a case that requires

525
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,159
from church discipline, but I want you to understand

526
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,499
that even when church discipline is exercised,

527
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:11,779
you know what the goal of church discipline is?

528
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,819
It's restoration.

529
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:16,299
That is the goal.

530
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,899
The goal of church discipline is not excommunication.

531
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:23,099
The goal of church discipline is restoration,

532
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,659
that someone would receive the warning and respond

533
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:30,059
appropriately to said warning so that they could be

534
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,299
in the fellowship, and we find here this evening

535
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,419
that the prescription is given, number three,

536
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,099
if you're taking notes, we see the problem,

537
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,419
the prescription, notice with me the purpose.

538
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,699
It's important for us to understand

539
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:44,179
that God always has purpose.

540
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,179
I'm thankful that God always has purpose,

541
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,019
and I find that the exhortation that is given here

542
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:51,500
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 14

543
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,899
to warn them that are unruly has a purpose.

544
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:58,379
I mentioned a moment ago that correction and instruction

545
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,500
are sometimes necessary in our lives,

546
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,940
but not only is it true that it's necessary at times,

547
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,019
I would say this, it is advantageous.

548
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:11,259
It is a benefit for us to receive warning.

549
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,099
And listen, if my behavior, if your behavior is out of line,

550
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:21,259
again, the idea of the word unruly, to be disorderly,

551
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,299
to deviate from the prescribed order or rule,

552
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,539
and if we get out of line, it is beneficial for us,

553
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:34,019
it is advantageous for us that somebody would warn us.

554
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,139
Amen?

555
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,899
I don't wanna keep going in the wrong way.

556
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,299
No, and so it really is a process

557
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:47,500
of recalibrating our thought process

558
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,459
with regard to this subject matter of warnings,

559
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:53,139
because they're good for us.

560
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:56,699
And God has instructed the local church that, listen,

561
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:59,339
at times, there are gonna be some unruly,

562
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,659
and you need to warn them.

563
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,659
But again, what's the purpose?

564
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,739
Well, the purpose is so that the behavior can be corrected,

565
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:12,619
and the individual or individuals can live in such a way

566
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,779
that God would be pleased.

567
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,659
That's ultimately the goal.

568
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,619
We find that every single person

569
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,259
will stand before God one day.

570
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,099
They'll stand before God one day.

571
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:27,059
Now, Paul, understanding that,

572
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,899
was active in the ministry of warning,

573
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:32,379
but we find that he speaks of this.

574
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:34,339
I'm just gonna look at one reference,

575
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,539
2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

576
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:41,379
a verse that many of us are familiar with.

577
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:44,259
In 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

578
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,899
you think about this truth of standing before the Lord.

579
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:49,379
I'm thankful this evening to be saved,

580
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,979
and to know that I will not stand

581
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,899
at the great white throne judgment.

582
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,019
Hallelujah.

583
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,979
But we will stand at the bema seat,

584
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,259
or the judgment seat of Christ.

585
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:03,059
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

586
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,779
therefore, we must all appear

587
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,819
before the judgment seat of Christ,

588
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,579
that everyone may receive the things done in his body,

589
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,739
according to that he hath done,

590
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,659
whether it be good or bad.

591
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,539
Now, I'm thankful I'm not gonna,

592
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,979
as I look here at this truth of standing before the Lord,

593
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,819
we all talk about, we often reference the truth

594
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:26,019
of wanting to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

595
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,859
Amen?

596
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,779
We talk about that, and we have that goal, if you will,

597
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,659
and God has placed spiritual leaders

598
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:37,739
and spiritual individuals that they could come,

599
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,220
and if there's someone or someones that are unruly,

600
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,619
that those that are spiritual would have the ability

601
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:48,459
to be able to warn them with God's word,

602
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:54,259
to explain how they're unruly, but also how to correct that,

603
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:56,299
so that they might please God,

604
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,459
that they might be able to hear,

605
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:01,259
well done, thou good and faithful servant.

606
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,699
It would be a terrible thing,

607
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,259
if someone noticed that the way you were doing something

608
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,259
was wrong, and just let you keep on doing it.

609
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,579
And at the very end, said, you know, I noticed that

610
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,459
a long time ago that you were doing that wrong,

611
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,779
and man, the consequences now are just so severe

612
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,419
and so deep, and you know how we would respond to that?

613
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,619
Why didn't you tell me?

614
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,299
Why didn't you warn me back then?

615
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:32,739
Why did you let me continue doing it the wrong way?

616
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:37,339
We find this evening that God gives this exhortation.

617
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,419
Again, it is possible, as we look at this portion

618
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,459
of scripture, that there will be, from time to time,

619
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,419
hopefully not all the time, there will be some

620
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,059
within a local church that are unruly,

621
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,500
and there is an appropriate way to handle,

622
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:56,260
God has given forth the instruction, His word,

623
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,019
on how to handle.

624
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,580
Again, it's not just immediately kick them out,

625
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,940
but it's also not just turn a blind eye.

626
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:07,339
You know how many, over the years, have thought

627
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,380
that the best way to handle something is to just

628
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,140
kind of sweep it under the carpet?

629
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,459
You know, that rarely, rarely, I would like to use

630
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,979
the word never, but I know you gotta be careful

631
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:21,940
using those types of words, but it rarely helps.

632
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,140
You just sweep something under the carpet,

633
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,580
it doesn't resolve anything.

634
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,059
So what does He say?

635
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,580
Warn them that are unruly.

636
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,559
I'm thankful that God's word warns.

637
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,500
I'm thankful that God's word gives us instruction.

638
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
From time to time, we need the warning,

639
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,739
we need the correction, and as we receive it,

640
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,399
we must acknowledge this evening, this is good for me.

641
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,359
This is beneficial for me.

642
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It is to my benefit that God would put someone

643
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,640
in my life that would warn me.

644
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,719
Now, if you're the one doing the warning,

645
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,559
I hope you'd have.

646
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:07,259
have the heart of the Apostle Paul, do it with tears, do it understanding that I'm not

647
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:13,559
trying to shame you, but I love you, and therefore I want to warn you because this behavior's

648
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,019
not good.

649
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,019
It's not biblical.

650
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,959
It doesn't align.

651
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,599
And so therefore, you need to have this warning.

652
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,879
What they do with it is between them and God.

653
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:28,739
But we fulfill our responsibility to warn them that are unruly.

654
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:29,739
Let's pray.

655
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:30,739
Father, we do love you.

656
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:32,139
We thank you for loving us.

657
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:35,099
We thank you for the instruction that's given.

658
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,059
Lord, we desire to walk worthy and please you.

659
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:48,739
God, I pray that you would help us to never be part of the crowd that are the unruly.

660
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:56,619
God, if at some point we find ourselves in the category of being the unruly, I pray,

661
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:03,019
Lord, that you'd help us to have sensitive hearts, help us to be receptive to the warnings

662
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,059
that would be given.

663
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:13,419
Lord, I pray that we would respond in obedience and we would correct that which has deviated

664
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:18,500
from that which you have given us to do, Lord, so that we might please you.

665
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,339
God, I pray that if we have the responsibility to warn that we do it in love, do it with

666
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:33,180
compassion, seeking that restoration and that preparation for that individual to be

667
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,299
able to stand before you one day.

668
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,860
Lord, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

669
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,479
We thank you for the privilege of being able to gather in the middle of our week and not

670
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:46,379
only study your Word but also to pray corporately, to pray together.

671
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,779
God, I pray that you'd bless our time.

672
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:52,299
I pray, Lord, that you'd work in a very distinct way and we'll thank you for what you'll do

673
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:54,619
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

674
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:55,619
Amen.

675
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:56,860
All right.
