WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.279
some homework.

00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:04.400
And that homework assignment from last Wednesday evening,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.239
what was it?

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.440
It was the homework assignment, who remembers?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.039
That means you didn't do it, amen.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.119
I know some of you did,

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.119
because some of you contacted me about it.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.960
Come on, help me out.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.560
What was the homework assignment?

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.879
Right, the phrase one accord in the book of Acts.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.000
And we're dealing with unity in the church,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.760
and I made the reference in the message

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.879
that that phrase one accord

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.559
is used repeatedly in the book of Acts.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.200
Now, there are some times in the book of Acts

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.720
that it's used, and it's not really used

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.319
in a beneficial way as far as the church

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.319
being in one accord, but the opposition

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.799
of God's people being in one accord

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.840
against the man of God.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.919
But I'm gonna read through the verses quickly.

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.159
If you jotted them down, if you did it,

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.240
if not, that's fine, but let's look at them.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.959
Acts one and verse 14 is the first one.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.119
And we're gonna go quickly through this,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.439
and we're just gonna make the reference,

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.840
read it, and keep going on.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.759
This isn't the lesson for tonight,

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.040
but I know some of you contacted me about it,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.360
so I thought it would be important

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.040
for us to deal with this.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.720
In Acts one and verse 14, it says,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.559
"'These all continued with one accord

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:15.699
"'in prayer and supplication with the women

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:17.239
"'and Mary, the mother of Jesus,

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.360
"'and with his brethren.'"

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.199
Chapter two and verse number one,

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:22.720
and when the day of Pentecost was fully come,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.760
they were all with one accord in one place.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.040
Chapter two and verse number 46, the Bible says,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.660
"'And they, continuing daily with one accord

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.519
"'in the temple and breaking bread from house to house,

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.040
"'did eat their meat with gladness

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400
"'and singleness of heart.'"

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.279
Chapter number four, if you turn over

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.980
in verse number 24 of chapter four, the Bible says,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.720
"'And when they heard that,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.959
"'they lifted up their voice to God with one accord

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.800
"'and said, Lord, thou art God,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.099
"'which hast made heaven and earth and the sea

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.279
"'and all that in them is.'"

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.199
And chapter number five, and I know I'm going quickly.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:08.960
I'm just trying to reference through them quickly.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.600
In chapter five and verse number 12, the Bible says,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.919
"'And by the hands of the apostles

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.800
"'were many signs and wonders wrought among the people,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.399
"'and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.'"

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.839
Now here's one that we see the phrase,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.479
but it's not of God's people being of one accord.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.720
In chapter seven, in verse number 57,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.119
after Stephen is preaching

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.919
and they're under great, deep conviction,

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.419
the Bible says that those enemies of the cross,

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.479
it says that, "'Then they cried out with a loud voice

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.479
"'and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord.'"

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:52.679
So we see that even the enemy at times will be in unity

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.240
against the cause of Christ,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.440
and we see that reference there.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.919
Of course, the idea of the challenge

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.320
was with regard to the people of God being in one accord.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.600
Acts eight and verse number six,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.440
the Bible says, "'And the people with one accord

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.199
"'gave heed unto those things which Philip spake,

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.220
"'hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.'"

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.100
In chapter number 12, it's a reference, again,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.520
really not with regard to the people of God.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.080
Peter had been in prison.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.440
Remember in Acts 12, God worked miraculously

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.080
in getting Peter's out of prison,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.800
and he's standing at the gate and he's knocking,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.479
and they don't let him in immediately.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.279
And of course, Herod's upset about this

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.759
because they can't find him,

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.759
and he examined the keepers of the prison and what have you.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.960
And in verse number 20 of Acts 12, it says,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.600
"'And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.300
"'but they came with one accord to him,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.479
"'and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.839
"'their friend desired peace because their country

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.360
"'was nourished by the king's country.'"

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.759
Turn over to chapter 15, if you will, Acts 15,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.619
and verse number 25, the Bible says,

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.559
"'It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord,

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.240
"'to send chosen men unto you

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.679
"'with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.'"

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.639
This is after the council at Jerusalem

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.919
and the decision that was made,

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.080
and they're talking about they're in unity

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.139
with regard to this.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.600
Chapter 18 in verse number 12,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.600
chapter 18 in verse number 12,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.279
the Bible says, again, this really isn't a good reference

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.920
for us either, but it says,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.480
"'And when Galileo was the deputy of Achaia,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.920
"'the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.040
"'and brought him to the judgment seat.'"

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.839
And then 19, Acts 19 in verse number 29,

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:47.679
the Bible says, "'And the whole city was filled

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.920
"'with confusion, and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.480
"'men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, in travel,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.799
"'they rushed with one accord into the theater.'"

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:59.079
And so we see that there's a few references, again,

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:03.679
of the enemy being in unity against the cause of Christ,

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.640
but we do find that as we've referenced

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.440
through these very quickly this evening,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.440
there's a number of references where God's people,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.440
the early church, they were in one accord, they had unity.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.760
The message last Wednesday evening, unity in the church,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.480
and we dealt with that from verse Thessalonians 5,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.559
the last portion of verse 13,

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.079
"'And be at peace among yourselves.'"

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:29.799
No wonder God was able to work so mightily

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:32.859
through the early church in the book of Acts,

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:36.239
as they were able to fill Jerusalem with their doctrine,

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.420
as they were able to turn the world upside down,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.459
they were in one accord, they were in unity,

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.540
and God blessed and God worked.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.260
And so I hope that was a blessing to you.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.700
If you need some of those references,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.480
maybe you didn't have all of them jotted down,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.279
I'd be happy to provide them for you.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.619
Now for the message this evening,

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.220
over in 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.619
as we continue studying through this portion of scripture,

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.940
or of course the last section of chapter five

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.739
of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:08.739
and then we'll get to the end of 2 Thessalonians

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:11.859
chapter number three, all part of the same study

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:16.859
that I have titled, Walk Worthy and Please God.

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.619
We find that, as I've mentioned in previous lessons

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:25.179
leading into the study, that really in both texts

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:29.739
of scripture, we find really this almost rapid fire

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.820
kind of instruction that is given to the local church.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.579
And it continues here in the text of scripture.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:39.220
And I want you to remember that the instruction

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.059
which is provided to a local church,

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.820
when followed, will enable the church

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.059
to walk worthy and please God.

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.700
Not only is it given to a local church,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.899
the church in Thessalonica, but we also understand,

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.059
as we mentioned in our very first lesson,

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.260
that the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.899
It's a good church.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.739
God is using that church in a mighty way,

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:04.940
but we find that God would lead the apostle Paul

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.140
to give this instruction to help them understand

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.459
how they should live and how they should behave

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:13.260
and how they should continue.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.820
We made reference in verse number 12

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.500
to the phrase when he said, we beseech you.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.299
But we also see now, as we enter into verse number 14,

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:26.540
that Paul says, now we exhort you.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.660
And so we see that he uses the phraseology

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.220
that we beseech you and now we exhort you.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.579
And so we see this instruction that's given

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.179
and we find really in verses 14 and 15

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:40.299
that there are five specific instructions

00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:43.420
that are given in these two verses of scripture.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.779
Now my plan is to deal with one piece of instruction

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:48.260
each service.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.179
I try to keep the lessons on Wednesday evening shorter

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.299
so that we have time for prayer.

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:55.980
At the end of our services, it is our prayer meeting

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.220
and I believe that God hears and answers prayer

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.859
and I think corporate prayer,

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:02.059
how many references of one accord

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.820
was how they were in one accord in prayer

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.940
when they lifted up their voice in one accord, right?

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.260
And so we find that it's important that we have that.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.420
So we'll look at each of these individual statements

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.339
that are given or words of instruction

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:19.859
and as we examine them, seeking to apply them again

00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:22.500
so that we might walk worthy and please God.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.559
So I'll read both verse 14 and 15.

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.059
The Bible says this, now we exhort you, brethren.

00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:31.339
Warm them that are unruly.

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:34.500
Comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.739
be patient toward all men.

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:40.500
See that none render evil for evil unto any man,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.419
but ever follow that which is good,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.840
both among yourselves and to all men.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.460
This evening, if you're taking notes,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.539
the title is just that first phrase there

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.659
after he says, we exhort you, brethren.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.140
The title for the lesson tonight

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.619
is warn them that are unruly.

00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:00.900
Warn them that are unruly.

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:03.299
If you're taking notes, number one, the problem.

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:05.659
The problem is addressed here in verse number 14.

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:06.659
What is the problem?

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:08.580
Well, there's some people that are unruly.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.619
And so we find that here,

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:14.260
because of there being a group of people,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.320
doesn't matter the size of the group,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.659
he uses warn them, so plural.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.419
It's not warn him or her.

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.500
It's a plural use of the word.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.580
And so therefore, there's some level of people

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.859
that would be in this category of being unruly.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.619
And so we see that as a problem.

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:35.900
We do not know who these individuals are specifically.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.979
Their names are not given to us,

00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:40.500
nor do we understand exactly the way

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.020
in which they are being unruly.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.179
God doesn't give us that information.

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:48.460
We find that he simply says, warn them that are unruly.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.219
And so we see the problem that is being addressed here

00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:53.580
in the text of scripture.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.219
It is of interest that the word unruly,

00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:59.979
this is the only time that this Greek word is used

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.579
all of the New Testament.

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:05.579
And this word, it literally means to be disorderly.

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:09.539
Often it would be used of soldiers that were out of rank.

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:12.539
And those of you that have served in the military

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.459
and you would understand that structure

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:17.859
of rank and responsibility,

00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:20.779
and it would often be used in that context.

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:24.019
It carries with it the idea of deviating

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:27.979
from the prescribed order or rule.

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.259
And so we find that they would deviate.

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:32.179
There were some that were unruly.

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:36.219
The reality is that as this piece of instruction,

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:40.459
this exhortation is given to the church at Thessalonica,

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:43.379
we understand that there are some there in Thessalonica

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:44.539
that are unruly.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:47.239
But I would say to you this evening

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.739
that as the portion of scripture,

00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:52.979
as this book of scripture has been preserved,

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:55.219
so that not only the church at Thessalonica

00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:57.419
could walk worthy and please the Lord,

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:00.299
but so that every local church that has the Bible

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:01.939
would have this instruction

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:05.379
so that they too could walk worthy and please God,

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.459
I would say this evening that there is an obvious

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.699
revelation that is given to us

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:15.219
that the reality is that there will always be some

00:11:15.219 --> 00:11:16.859
who are unruly.

00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:17.899
Now here's the reality.

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:20.419
I don't wanna be part of the group that's the unruly.

00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:24.219
And I hope, it's almost like this.

00:11:24.219 --> 00:11:27.219
If you have to ask if I'm part of the unruly,

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.419
chances are you might be, you know what I mean?

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:32.199
You kinda can kinda figure that out.

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:35.739
But we find that there's some there in the church

00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:36.939
that are unruly.

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:39.539
Now it's interesting because we find that

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:41.559
even in the lesson from last week,

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:44.539
when he said be at peace among yourselves,

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:47.259
the importance of unity,

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.579
we find that as we referenced even last week,

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:52.539
the church at Corinth, it was a church of divisions

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:55.019
and all of the contentions that were going on

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.939
and no doubt there were some in Corinth

00:11:57.659 --> 00:11:58.499
that were unruly.

00:11:58.499 --> 00:12:02.179
And it'd be easy for us to note that and acknowledge that

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:04.279
as you study through the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:07.139
But I think maybe as you read the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:10.999
if you do not have this exhortation in verse number 14,

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.739
you might be led to believe that it was just a church

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:15.819
where everything was going perfectly well

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.219
and everyone was right in line.

00:12:18.219 --> 00:12:21.319
But God says warn them that are unruly.

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:23.099
Warn them that are unruly.

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:25.019
Notice not only the problem,

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:28.019
we find that there are some there that are unruly,

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:29.419
the prescription.

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:32.179
What does God prescribe for these that are unruly?

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:33.899
Does he say excommunicate them?

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.659
I mean, get them out if they're unruly.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:39.059
No, he says warn them, warn them.

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.259
By the way, I like that prescription.

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:43.459
Our God is a gracious God.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:45.619
Our God is a long suffering God.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:48.579
Our God is a God who wants his people to be informed.

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:50.539
He wants us to have the information.

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:53.719
He wants us to know how we can please him,

00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:55.639
how we can walk worthy.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:59.119
And so the admonition, the exhortation here,

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:03.159
the problem is addressed, but the prescription is given

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:06.199
that we are to warn them, a warning.

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:08.519
Now we all know what a warning is.

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.839
We also know that a warning can be ignored, right?

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:14.899
A warning can be ignored.

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.759
Let me say this about warnings.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:18.919
I believe that warnings are good for us.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.059
It's good to be warned.

00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:25.179
You ever see a sign that has some warning,

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.619
a road sign about some danger that lies ahead?

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.499
I mean, how many times when we're driving,

00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:31.979
we say that, well, no, we might be upset

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.099
that the bridge is out ahead

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:35.219
and we can't go the route that we wanted to go,

00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:37.739
but we certainly appreciate the warning

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:39.779
that there was a bridge out ahead, right?

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.979
We don't get mad at the person that put the warning up

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:43.939
and say, I can't believe they would warn me.

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:47.019
No, you're just gonna go off the cliff and die.

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:50.219
No, the warning is good, right?

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:55.059
How many of you have cleaning supplies in your home?

00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:58.619
On the back, there's some warning labels, right?

00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:01.499
But we're familiar with warnings, we understand.

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:06.499
And here, we find that God says there's some people

00:14:06.499 --> 00:14:10.219
that are categorized, that are described as being unruly,

00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:13.339
and the prescription, what you do is you warn them.

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:17.859
I ask this question, how is it that we are to warn them?

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:19.779
Well, I believe very clearly

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:24.299
that we are to use the authoritative word of God.

00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:26.259
It's God's word that gives the warning.

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.659
It is God's word that we use

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:31.699
when we're warning someone that is unruly.

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:33.139
We find, if you take your Bible,

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:35.539
turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 19,

00:14:35.539 --> 00:14:37.859
we're gonna look at a number of verses of Scripture

00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:39.379
in order to prove this point

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:43.299
with regard to the prescription and the process.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.539
How many of you ever have gotten a prescription?

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:49.459
Come on, I know a bunch of you have gotten prescriptions,

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:51.339
amen, I've gotten prescriptions in my life.

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:53.939
What happens when they give you a prescription?

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:55.499
They tell you how to use it?

00:14:55.499 --> 00:14:57.579
Yeah, is that what they do?

00:14:57.579 --> 00:14:59.539
Not always, right?

00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:02.779
I'm not talking about all the this might cause this

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:04.739
and this might be that, but they give you some words

00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:06.419
of this is how you're supposed to use it.

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:08.859
Don't take it with this, make sure you have food,

00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:10.499
so on and so forth, right?

00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:13.379
And so we find that in Psalm 19,

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:16.899
how is it that these that are unruly are to be warned?

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:20.379
Well, the process in which we use to warn the unruly

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:24.499
is by going to God's authoritative word.

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:26.539
Notice, we won't take the time to read

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.179
verse seven through 10 of Psalm 19,

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.939
but if you look in that portion of Scripture,

00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:33.619
it's quite obvious that he's dealing with God's word,

00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:35.739
and he says this in verse number 11,

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:40.659
moreover, by them, speaking of the law of the Lord,

00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:44.179
the statutes of the Lord, the judgments of the Lord,

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:46.659
so on and so forth, all the references that are given,

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:50.859
by them is thy servant, what does it say?

00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:51.699
Warned.

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:56.899
By them, by God's word is thy servant warned,

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:00.659
and then notice this, and in keeping of them, God's word,

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:02.979
there is great reward.

00:16:02.979 --> 00:16:04.139
You know what that reveals to me?

00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:07.539
That reveals to me that when God gives us a warning,

00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:10.379
that in keeping that warning and taking heed

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:13.139
to that warning, it's beneficial for us,

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:16.819
just like that warning on that poison

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:19.219
that says do not consume.

00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:23.339
It's for your best interest that you do not consume

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:27.739
that particular product because it can cause great harm

00:16:27.739 --> 00:16:30.899
or even death, and so we find this evening

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:35.899
that God says that his word is given to us,

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:39.859
and it warns his people, and in keeping of them,

00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:41.419
God's word, there's great reward,

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:45.499
and so if we as a local body, if the church at Thessalonica,

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.659
if any other church throughout the era of the church

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:52.059
is going to have some that are unruly,

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:55.139
how is it that they warn the unruly?

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.979
They must use God's word.

00:16:56.979 --> 00:17:00.299
The process involves using the word of God.

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:04.339
Notice the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter number 20.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.259
We see the truth in Psalm 19 of the way

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:10.059
that God's word would warn us,

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:12.539
but notice, if you will, in Acts chapter 20,

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:14.739
Paul makes a great statement here

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:18.739
with regard to the ministry in which he was involved with,

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:21.379
and when I think about this ministry

00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:23.499
and I think about the text here,

00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:26.059
we see the compassion of Paul.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:28.859
Notice in verse 31 of Acts 20,

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:32.539
it says, therefore, watch and remember,

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:33.379
remember what?

00:17:33.379 --> 00:17:34.899
That by the space of three years,

00:17:34.899 --> 00:17:38.219
I cease not to warn everyone night and day.

00:17:38.219 --> 00:17:42.779
You see those next two words with tears, with tears.

00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:46.099
See, when someone is unruly,

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.459
it's not that we're warning them

00:17:47.459 --> 00:17:51.379
because we're trying to bring the hammer down on them.

00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:52.819
You know what I mean by that?

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:57.499
No, we're warning them because we want to see them respond

00:17:57.499 --> 00:18:01.539
and obey, and we find here that Paul,

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.419
I believe contextually,

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:06.459
we could obviously say that he was preaching the gospel.

00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:11.379
He was warning people about the penalty of their sin

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:13.019
and they needed to be born again,

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:16.299
but I believe that not only do we see the warning,

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:18.339
he says, everyone night and day with tears,

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:19.659
the warning of the lost

00:18:19.659 --> 00:18:21.419
about the fact they need to be saved,

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:23.899
but also the warning of God's people

00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:27.859
that they need to walk in obedience to the Lord,

00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:30.579
and we find that he's warning them,

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.699
and he says that's part of the ministry

00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:33.820
that he's involved with.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.739
It's interesting, notice, continue looking

00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:38.260
at the Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians chapter four,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.099
and looking at his ministry and his behavior.

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.699
So he's writing to the church at Thessalonica

00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.940
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.419
about warning them that are unruly,

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:51.699
but understand that Paul himself understood

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:54.699
the responsibility that God had entrusted him

00:18:54.699 --> 00:18:58.419
to warn others during his ministry,

00:18:58.419 --> 00:19:01.659
and how he was not only instructing a local church

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:03.299
to warn them that are unruly,

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:06.299
but he himself also had to do some warning

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:07.820
during his ministry.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.579
By the way, it's not always great being on the side

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:12.619
of having to warn somebody else.

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:13.459
You know why?

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.099
They don't always respond well.

00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:18.339
You know, sometimes you warn somebody

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:21.179
and they get mad at you, right?

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:23.099
It's just how it works.

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:24.339
It's unfortunate.

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:26.399
You wish everybody would respond well,

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:27.779
but it's just not the way it works,

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:30.619
and so we find here, notice in 1 Corinthians four,

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:33.099
Paul says this in verse number 14,

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.139
I write not these things to shame you,

00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:41.139
but as my beloved sons, I warn you.

00:19:41.419 --> 00:19:43.019
I warn you.

00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:45.699
Now, we see in the context of 1 Corinthians,

00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.619
Paul is writing to the church at Corinth,

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:50.739
a church that's made up of saved people, amen?

00:19:50.739 --> 00:19:52.419
That's what makes a church,

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:57.219
is that you're a group of saved, baptized followers

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.500
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.299
He's writing to them, but he also.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:05.299
says in the verse, as my beloved sons, I warn you.

00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:10.059
Many of us in the room this evening have children.

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:13.679
No doubt we can understand that if we are to watch

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.139
our child do something that's going to cause them

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:19.499
great harm, that we warn them.

00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:20.699
We warn them.

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.899
Why is it that we warn them?

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:25.219
Because we love them, right?

00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:26.059
Because we love them.

00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:30.579
We don't want them to consume or to participate,

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:33.419
partake of whatever the situation is,

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:35.279
whatever the circumstance is, and so we see it,

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:38.879
so we warn them, hey, hey, be careful, don't do that.

00:20:38.879 --> 00:20:40.739
We understand that in life.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:44.859
And so Paul says, I'm not writing these things to shame you,

00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:46.579
I'm simply warning you, why?

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.099
Because there needs to be a change in the behavior,

00:20:49.099 --> 00:20:50.899
ultimately, as we'll see in just a moment,

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:53.199
because you're gonna stand before God one day.

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:57.399
And so we find that he says that I'm warning you.

00:20:57.399 --> 00:21:01.599
Notice in the book of Colossians, in chapter number one,

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:05.139
notice what Paul says here as he's writing to this church

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.599
in Colossae, a church that Paul did not start,

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.519
a church that is, best we can tell,

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:12.519
Paul never had any personal interaction with them

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:14.819
other than hearing about their salvation

00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:17.279
and their spiritual growth and praying for them

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:19.039
and then writing to them.

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:22.279
And we find in Colossians one, in verse number 28,

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:26.719
notice how he describes his ministry that God has given.

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:30.199
It says, whom we preach, speaking about preaching Christ,

00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:35.199
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom,

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:40.199
notice the ultimate goal, that we may present every man

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:43.879
perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.159
What does that word perfect mean?

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:47.759
It means, it carries the idea of being complete.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.939
It does not mean that you'll never sin again,

00:21:49.939 --> 00:21:51.859
it does not mean that you're gonna reach this place

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:55.419
of sinless perfection, it means that you'll be complete.

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:58.059
I'm thankful that one day we'll all be perfect,

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:00.579
but that's after we leave this world, amen?

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:03.979
I'm not gonna be perfect on this world and neither are you.

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:07.179
And that's just the way it is, but we can be complete

00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:10.539
and Paul says, I'm warning and I'm teaching, why?

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:14.539
So that we might be able to present every man perfect

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:16.459
in Christ Jesus.

00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:19.499
I'm not warning people to embarrass them, to shame them,

00:22:19.499 --> 00:22:22.739
to ridicule them, to, you're always picking on me.

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:25.259
No, no, no, Paul says, it's because I want you

00:22:25.259 --> 00:22:28.619
to be able to be complete in Christ.

00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:31.859
And what a great heart, what a great perspective.

00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:34.819
We notice, I'm not gonna turn there for sake of time,

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:36.979
we're familiar, of course, with the truth

00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:40.059
of 2 Timothy 3 and verse number 16, where the Bible says

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.179
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:46.339
and it's profitable for doctrine and we always speak

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:48.179
about that, the importance of doctrine,

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:51.499
but the Bible doesn't stop there, it says for reproof,

00:22:51.499 --> 00:22:54.419
for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:56.979
that the man of God might be perfect,

00:22:56.979 --> 00:23:00.339
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:03.299
And so we find, listen, at times in my life,

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.679
at times in your life, guess what?

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:08.719
We need some warning, there's some correction,

00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:13.099
some instruction that's needed and God says here

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:16.539
in 1 Thessalonians chapter five in verse number 14,

00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:21.539
he says, warn them that are unruly.

00:23:21.699 --> 00:23:24.519
The problem is that there were some that were unruly.

00:23:25.499 --> 00:23:28.839
The problem is one that's consistent amongst churches.

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:29.679
Why?

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.339
Because we're all human beings.

00:23:31.339 --> 00:23:33.219
He says, warn them that are unruly.

00:23:33.219 --> 00:23:36.659
He says, this is the problem, but here's the prescription,

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:38.299
warn them, how?

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.939
What is the process by which we use in order

00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:43.899
to warn those that are unruly?

00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:46.019
He tells them, listen, it's not a matter

00:23:46.379 --> 00:23:47.219
of excommunication.

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:49.659
Now, we do find that at times it might become

00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:51.399
church discipline matters.

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:56.239
By the way, church discipline isn't real popular in 2024,

00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:58.859
but it's still biblical, amen?

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:01.859
And at times there might be a case that requires

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:05.159
from church discipline, but I want you to understand

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:08.499
that even when church discipline is exercised,

00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:11.779
you know what the goal of church discipline is?

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:13.819
It's restoration.

00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:16.299
That is the goal.

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:19.899
The goal of church discipline is not excommunication.

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:23.099
The goal of church discipline is restoration,

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:26.659
that someone would receive the warning and respond

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:30.059
appropriately to said warning so that they could be

00:24:30.059 --> 00:24:33.299
in the fellowship, and we find here this evening

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:35.419
that the prescription is given, number three,

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:37.099
if you're taking notes, we see the problem,

00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:40.419
the prescription, notice with me the purpose.

00:24:40.419 --> 00:24:41.699
It's important for us to understand

00:24:41.699 --> 00:24:44.179
that God always has purpose.

00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:46.179
I'm thankful that God always has purpose,

00:24:46.179 --> 00:24:49.019
and I find that the exhortation that is given here

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:51.500
in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 14

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.899
to warn them that are unruly has a purpose.

00:24:55.899 --> 00:24:58.379
I mentioned a moment ago that correction and instruction

00:24:58.379 --> 00:25:00.500
are sometimes necessary in our lives,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.940
but not only is it true that it's necessary at times,

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.019
I would say this, it is advantageous.

00:25:08.379 --> 00:25:11.259
It is a benefit for us to receive warning.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.099
And listen, if my behavior, if your behavior is out of line,

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:21.259
again, the idea of the word unruly, to be disorderly,

00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:25.299
to deviate from the prescribed order or rule,

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:29.539
and if we get out of line, it is beneficial for us,

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:34.019
it is advantageous for us that somebody would warn us.

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:36.139
Amen?

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:39.899
I don't wanna keep going in the wrong way.

00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:44.299
No, and so it really is a process

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:47.500
of recalibrating our thought process

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.459
with regard to this subject matter of warnings,

00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:53.139
because they're good for us.

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:56.699
And God has instructed the local church that, listen,

00:25:56.699 --> 00:25:59.339
at times, there are gonna be some unruly,

00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:01.659
and you need to warn them.

00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:03.659
But again, what's the purpose?

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:07.739
Well, the purpose is so that the behavior can be corrected,

00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:12.619
and the individual or individuals can live in such a way

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:14.779
that God would be pleased.

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:16.659
That's ultimately the goal.

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:20.619
We find that every single person

00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:22.259
will stand before God one day.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:25.099
They'll stand before God one day.

00:26:25.099 --> 00:26:27.059
Now, Paul, understanding that,

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:29.899
was active in the ministry of warning,

00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:32.379
but we find that he speaks of this.

00:26:32.379 --> 00:26:34.339
I'm just gonna look at one reference,

00:26:34.379 --> 00:26:38.539
2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:41.379
a verse that many of us are familiar with.

00:26:41.379 --> 00:26:44.259
In 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:46.899
you think about this truth of standing before the Lord.

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:49.379
I'm thankful this evening to be saved,

00:26:49.379 --> 00:26:50.979
and to know that I will not stand

00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:52.899
at the great white throne judgment.

00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:54.019
Hallelujah.

00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:56.979
But we will stand at the bema seat,

00:26:56.979 --> 00:26:59.259
or the judgment seat of Christ.

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:03.059
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, in verse number 10,

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:05.779
therefore, we must all appear

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:07.819
before the judgment seat of Christ,

00:27:07.819 --> 00:27:10.579
that everyone may receive the things done in his body,

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:12.739
according to that he hath done,

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:14.659
whether it be good or bad.

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:16.539
Now, I'm thankful I'm not gonna,

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:18.979
as I look here at this truth of standing before the Lord,

00:27:18.979 --> 00:27:21.819
we all talk about, we often reference the truth

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:26.019
of wanting to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:26.859
Amen?

00:27:26.859 --> 00:27:30.779
We talk about that, and we have that goal, if you will,

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:35.659
and God has placed spiritual leaders

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:37.739
and spiritual individuals that they could come,

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:41.220
and if there's someone or someones that are unruly,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.619
that those that are spiritual would have the ability

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:48.459
to be able to warn them with God's word,

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:54.259
to explain how they're unruly, but also how to correct that,

00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:56.299
so that they might please God,

00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.459
that they might be able to hear,

00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:01.259
well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:03.699
It would be a terrible thing,

00:28:05.139 --> 00:28:08.259
if someone noticed that the way you were doing something

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:11.259
was wrong, and just let you keep on doing it.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.579
And at the very end, said, you know, I noticed that

00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:17.459
a long time ago that you were doing that wrong,

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:20.779
and man, the consequences now are just so severe

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:24.419
and so deep, and you know how we would respond to that?

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:25.619
Why didn't you tell me?

00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:28.299
Why didn't you warn me back then?

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:32.739
Why did you let me continue doing it the wrong way?

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:37.339
We find this evening that God gives this exhortation.

00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:41.419
Again, it is possible, as we look at this portion

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:45.459
of scripture, that there will be, from time to time,

00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:48.419
hopefully not all the time, there will be some

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:51.059
within a local church that are unruly,

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:53.500
and there is an appropriate way to handle,

00:28:53.659 --> 00:28:56.260
God has given forth the instruction, His word,

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.019
on how to handle.

00:28:58.019 --> 00:29:00.580
Again, it's not just immediately kick them out,

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.940
but it's also not just turn a blind eye.

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:07.339
You know how many, over the years, have thought

00:29:07.339 --> 00:29:09.380
that the best way to handle something is to just

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.140
kind of sweep it under the carpet?

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:15.459
You know, that rarely, rarely, I would like to use

00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:17.979
the word never, but I know you gotta be careful

00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:21.940
using those types of words, but it rarely helps.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.140
You just sweep something under the carpet,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.580
it doesn't resolve anything.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.059
So what does He say?

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:30.580
Warn them that are unruly.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.559
I'm thankful that God's word warns.

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:36.500
I'm thankful that God's word gives us instruction.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500
From time to time, we need the warning,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.739
we need the correction, and as we receive it,

00:29:41.739 --> 00:29:45.399
we must acknowledge this evening, this is good for me.

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:47.359
This is beneficial for me.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
It is to my benefit that God would put someone

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:56.640
in my life that would warn me.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.719
Now, if you're the one doing the warning,

00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:00.559
I hope you'd have.

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:07.259
have the heart of the Apostle Paul, do it with tears, do it understanding that I'm not

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:13.559
trying to shame you, but I love you, and therefore I want to warn you because this behavior's

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:15.019
not good.

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:16.019
It's not biblical.

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:17.959
It doesn't align.

00:30:17.959 --> 00:30:20.599
And so therefore, you need to have this warning.

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:23.879
What they do with it is between them and God.

00:30:23.879 --> 00:30:28.739
But we fulfill our responsibility to warn them that are unruly.

00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:29.739
Let's pray.

00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:30.739
Father, we do love you.

00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:32.139
We thank you for loving us.

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:35.099
We thank you for the instruction that's given.

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:39.059
Lord, we desire to walk worthy and please you.

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:48.739
God, I pray that you would help us to never be part of the crowd that are the unruly.

00:30:48.739 --> 00:30:56.619
God, if at some point we find ourselves in the category of being the unruly, I pray,

00:30:56.619 --> 00:31:03.019
Lord, that you'd help us to have sensitive hearts, help us to be receptive to the warnings

00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:05.059
that would be given.

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:13.419
Lord, I pray that we would respond in obedience and we would correct that which has deviated

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:18.500
from that which you have given us to do, Lord, so that we might please you.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:25.339
God, I pray that if we have the responsibility to warn that we do it in love, do it with

00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:33.180
compassion, seeking that restoration and that preparation for that individual to be

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.299
able to stand before you one day.

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:37.860
Lord, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.479
We thank you for the privilege of being able to gather in the middle of our week and not

00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:46.379
only study your Word but also to pray corporately, to pray together.

00:31:46.379 --> 00:31:48.779
God, I pray that you'd bless our time.

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:52.299
I pray, Lord, that you'd work in a very distinct way and we'll thank you for what you'll do

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:54.619
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:31:54.619 --> 00:31:55.619
Amen.

00:31:55.619 --> 00:31:56.860
All right.
