WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
picture after my message last week and you know we've been talking in

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:08.760
Colossians chapter number three about the sins of the flesh and all the things

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.600
are going on and sometimes if we're not careful I mentioned this from verse

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.879
number five and also coupled with the truth of verses eight and nine that

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.360
sometimes I've had people say to me well I've never murdered anybody and I'm like

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.159
hey that's a good thing you know but sometimes what happens if you look on

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.200
the left here the side view kind of the the bar graph if you will how we see sin

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.720
right we kind of say well this one's really bad and this one's not so bad and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.840
you know lying might be over here and adultery and fornication and murder and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.360
however our view of sin is but that same bar graph from the top view looking down

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.759
sin is sin to God amen and I shared with you that statement that that preacher

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:57.400
made from yesteryear when the congregant said hey pastor you don't need to be

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.080
preaching about sin because sin is different in the life of a believer and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.519
that preacher with great wisdom said you're right it's worse it's worse and

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:11.879
what great truth and so I thought that'd be a great thing to share with you I

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.760
appreciate it Brianna sharing it with me we were talking after church on Sunday

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.239
and she said you know daddy as you were preaching I thought about this picture I

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:21.919
saw once and she showed it to me and I said man would you send that to me

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:25.279
that's really good I like that so I hope it's a blessing to you as well and

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.879
Colossians chapter number three beginning verse number 10 this morning

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.839
Colossians 3 and be looking in verse number 10 this morning is where we'll

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.760
begin and of course as we've studied this portion of Scripture over the past

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.720
couple of weeks we have examined verses 5 through 9 and as we've examined these

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.720
verses of Scripture we have noted that Paul was both direct and detailed he

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.639
didn't hold anything back amen he just kind of laid it right on the table

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.839
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth is how he starts

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:59.559
verse number five and then in verse number eight put now ye also excuse me

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:05.599
but now ye also put off all these he was very direct with these believers in

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.160
Colossi and we find that not only was he direct but he was detailed he provided a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.880
list of things that needed to be put off things that we as believers ought not be

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.080
engaged in behavior that is not appropriate for us and we find that I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.679
believe that he was direct and detailed because he understood the danger that

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:30.440
our flesh presents I said this last week by way of introduction it'd be wonderful

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.679
if that salvation our flesh was eradicated we didn't have to deal with

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:38.639
it anymore but you know as well as I do that that is not the case and we still

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.039
have this flesh one day this mortal shall put on immortality and this

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:49.679
corruption shall put on incorruption but until then the flesh lusteth against

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:54.000
the spirit in fact as we've looked at this really thought from Colossians 3

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.679
it's interesting this evening if you're back with us will be in Genesis chapter

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:01.800
21 and we'll be looking at some of that very same truth that we find here in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.080
Colossians all the way back in Genesis in the allegory that Paul refers to as

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.600
that portion of Scripture as he's mentioning and ministering to the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.080
believers in the region of Galatia but we find that Paul as he's providing the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.440
the in the the believers in Colossi with this information we say that there's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.919
some things that need to be put off some things that we ought not be engaged in

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.880
but that's only possible as we would crucify our flesh and as we'd

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.399
understand that we need to walk in the Spirit the Bible says walk in the Spirit

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:37.039
and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh and that's as true as for God

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:42.080
so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son amen we can have victory

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.639
through the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm so thankful for the victory that he

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.600
provides you note in verse number five some of those things that he deals with

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.800
fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.720
covetousness which he likens to idolatry we find in verse number eight he said

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.919
anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication and verse number nine

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:13.080
lying what a list and we see that these are things that as a believer we are to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.279
put off that we're not to be engaged in this behavior would a mortify our

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.440
members which are upon the earth we find as I concluded last week that we need to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.720
learn to identify sin in our lives and the Bible will help you to identify what

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.959
is sin we do not determine what is sin by what the culture says we do not

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:36.279
determine what is sin by what the government says we live in a time we

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:41.079
live in an age right now that of course through all of human history you see it

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:46.640
all the way back in the land of Judah as Jeremiah would deal with they legislate

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.799
wickedness Isaiah deals with so many things I was reading the book of Isaiah

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:55.200
this morning in my personal devotions and we find that the reality is that

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.399
we're living in a time in which listen right is called wrong and wrong is

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.839
called right we're living in a time in which they legislate wickedness but for

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:09.279
the child of God that is not how we determine what is sin we don't look at

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.760
what's popular we don't look at what's accepted we look to the Word of God and

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.559
we say no God's Word says this is sin and therefore I'm identifying sin in my

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:25.440
life when I do so I then come to that place where I refuse to excuse it I'm

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.239
not gonna make any provision for the flesh amen I'm gonna refuse to excuse

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.320
sin I'm gonna come to that place where I'm gonna confess it and I'm gonna

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.959
forsake it because we find that he that covereth his sin shall not prosper but

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.799
we have a God who is ready to pardon who is ready to forgive and what a

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:49.519
tremendous blessing that is and as we know all of these things that he deals

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:54.320
with in verses 5 through 9 we then come to the section of this book we'll look

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.720
at verses 10 through 14 this morning where he's going to now give instruction

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.440
with regard to what needs to be put on as we find in verse number 11 excuse me

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.480
verse number 12 he says this put on therefore as the elect of God holy and

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.200
beloved and then he's gonna begin the list and so this morning I've simply

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.279
entitled the message from verse number 12 put on therefore if you take some

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:26.040
things off if you put off you need to put on and we find that as even the

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.640
analogy would be known to these believers in Colossi we made note of it

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.399
as we've studied the last couple of weeks it's almost that picture that

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:38.880
analogy that example of putting off filthy garments to put on clean

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.239
garments one preacher of yesteryear said it this way you put off the grave

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:51.440
clothes to put on the grace clothes I like that Peter says that we're to be

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.239
that were to be clothed in humility and we'll look at that in just a moment as

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:00.079
we get into this list but before we look at the list I want you to notice a

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.640
couple of things in verses 10 and 11 if you're taking notes this morning from

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.679
verse number 10 I want you to note the plan God has a plan for you he has a

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.720
plan for me and we find that as Paul begins here in verse number 10 he says

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.320
and have put on the new man remember he's writing to believers we find that

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.359
in Colossians 1 he's heard about the Epaphras had delivered to Paul Paul

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:27.079
never ministered in Colossi but Epaphras delivered to Paul about this church and

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.399
these believers and how they were growing and how God was working and Paul

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:36.000
was encouraged and Paul commended them and Paul prayed for them and we find

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.720
that he's speaking to these believers and he says and have put on the new man

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.760
which is renewed in knowledge notice this after the image of him that created

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.679
him you know that as we think about the last phrase of verse number 10 and

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:56.959
really note the plan that God has for us you'll find that as you study the Word

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:02.359
of God that you will discover that God's plan is that God's people look like God's

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:09.600
son amen that's God's plan according to Romans 8 verse number 29 the Bible says

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.839
that were to be conformed to the image of his dear son according to what Paul

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:17.679
says in Ephesus and Ephesians 1 in verse number 10 he says that we should

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:23.559
be holy and without blame before him in love notice that in verse number 12 he

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:29.079
uses some of that same phraseology holy and beloved in verse number 12 the

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:34.760
reality is that God desires for his people to take on the image of his son

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.200
they were called Christians first in Antioch the Bible tells us to be a

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.960
Christian is to be one that would follow Christ one that as someone would

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.520
identify and evaluate you they would see that there are characteristics in your

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.599
life that would be true of the Lord Jesus Christ we find that Peter would

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:59.679
say this that Jesus has left us an example that we should follow his steps

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:05.719
what a joy to know that we can be can be conformed to the image of his dear son

00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:10.559
it's a process of putting off and putting on and I believe that the truth

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:16.320
that we would find with regard to this plan is really the theological term that

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.039
we would refer to as sanctification sanctification someone said this

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:27.599
salvation is the miracle of a moment aren't you thankful for that there's a

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.640
time that you were born again amen a date in a time a place you trust at

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.039
Christ as your Savior salvation is the miracle of a moment but sanctification

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:42.559
is the process of a lifetime amen we are continually listen I understand I'm

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:46.840
thankful that positionally I'm seated in the heavenlies according to what Paul

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.840
says to the believers in Ephesus positionally I'm sanctified but

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.400
practically speaking as we have this flesh as we're here upon this earth

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.080
there's a process of progressive sanctification that we're becoming

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.280
more and more like the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are identifying sin in our lives,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.040
that we're seeking to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit of God, and we're

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.000
becoming like Christ. And I'm thankful that one day, according to what John says

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.240
in 1 John, that we shall see him and we shall be like him. Amen? And what a

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.640
joy that is! But until then, there's this process of sanctification. The word

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.640
means to be consecrated. It means to be set apart for a sacred purpose. I want

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.800
you to consider, as we think about this plan here in verse number 10, I want you

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.240
to consider what Paul said to the believers in Thessalonica. Hold your

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.440
place here in Colossians and turn over to 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.280
if you will. 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4. I'm going to read a couple of verses to

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.920
you. In verses 3 and 4, we see this phrase used with regard to sanctification, but I

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.040
want you to understand what Paul says to these believers. He says this, he begins

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:03.720
verse number 3, for this is the will of God, even your sanctification that you

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.800
should abstain from fornication. That was one of the things that was mentioned in

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.240
verse number 5, actually the first item that Paul dealt with in Colossians 3 and

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.400
verse number 5. Notice verse number 4, 1 Thessalonians 4, that every one of

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.200
you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:31.000
Oftentimes our bodies are referred to as a vessel, a temple, a tabernacle. Peter

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.160
says, I must put off shortly this my tabernacle. We find our vessel, Paul uses

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.560
that phraseology with Timothy about our bodies and being a vessel that is fit

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.720
for the master's use, and we find here that Paul is encouraging these

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.000
believers in Thessalonica with regard to sanctification. I know I've said it in

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the past, it's worth repeating, you're as close to God today as you want to be.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.840
You're as close to God today as you want to be. I'm as close to God today as I

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.960
want to be. The reality is that we read our Bibles as much as we want to, we pray

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.040
as much as we want to, we attend church as much as we want to, we do all of the

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.960
things as much as we desire to do so, and we find that that process of

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.560
sanctification. I wonder this morning, see there are times in which, have you ever

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.440
been in a place in a position in which maybe if you're a sports fan it's kind

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.040
of extra innings or overtime or whatever, you're kind of glued to, you want to

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.320
listen in and and find out what's going on, and somebody's calling you for

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.280
something else that needs to take place, you need to be somewhere else, you know

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.160
like you're just glued to it, you don't want to leave, you don't want to be

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.880
distracted, you want to see what happens, you want to see the end. I wonder if we've

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.240
ever had that same feeling when it comes to reading our Bibles, when it comes to

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.560
praying, when someone would beckon us for some other duty, some other

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.880
responsibility that it's just like, man I don't want to leave because it's so

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.080
rich and it's so wonderful being in his presence and I'm enjoying this and I

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.720
don't want to leave this, and perhaps you may have to for whatever the reason may

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.080
be, but I just wonder this morning how much do we really love the Lord and love

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.960
his Word? The psalmist cries out in Psalm 119,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:21.680
oh how love I thy law, it is my meditation all the day long. Not only do

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.040
we note the plan here in verse number 10, but I want you to note a principle that

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.160
is given to us in verse number 11. This is an important principle. The Bible

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.760
says this, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:43.040
barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all. And I want you

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.440
to notice that last phrase in verse number 11 where he says, Christ is all and in all.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.200
I am thankful that it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ. We are reminded in

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.040
Colossians 1 in verse number 18 that he is to have the preeminence, that in all

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.960
things he would have the preeminence, that he would have that first place, that

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.800
first position, and we understand that it's all about Christ. But we find that

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.600
as Paul would give in verse number 11 when he's making these distinctions, he

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.000
says there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.040
barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free. I believe that the principle that Paul is

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.160
communicating to these believers in Colossae, and what a great principle for

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.680
us to understand this morning, is that in Christ there is no partiality. There is

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.640
no partiality in Christ. I'm thankful this morning that our God is no

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.800
respecter of persons, aren't you? And we too are to be no respecter of persons.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.920
There's no partiality. Listen to what Paul says in the book of

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.440
Galatians. Turn to Galatians chapter number 3. Notice a couple of verses here.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.920
Of course they were dealing with some of the very things here in the region of

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.400
Galatia where these Judaizers were coming in and all sorts of things. There

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.120
was division. You understand that this thing of partiality goes all the way

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.000
back to the beginning of human history. This is nothing new for us in the 21st

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.240
century to deal with this subject of partiality. This is something that's

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.600
existed for millennia, and the reality is that we find in the Word of God that

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.440
there's to be no partiality. What a great principle this is. In Galatians chapter

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.760
number 3 and verse number 28, notice he says there is neither Jew nor Greek,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.880
there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.840
one in Christ Jesus. We find that in chapter number 5 of the book of Galatians,

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.760
notice in verse number 6, he says, for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:48.120
anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love. I'm thankful for

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.120
the truth that God has given us in His Word with regard to this subject and how

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.160
relevant it is even for the day in which we're living, and you understand that in

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.360
Christ there is no ethnic, no culture, no economic, no racial, no social

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.560
distinction. We are in Christ. I've often said from this pulpit for many, many

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.360
years, I've said from this pulpit that there are two categories of people in

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.440
our world. There are people that are saved, and there are people that are lost.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.080
And the duty of the people that are saved is to preach the gospel to the

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.040
people that are lost. Amen? There's no partiality in Christ, and we find that

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.720
division is a work of the enemy. We find that the enemy seeks to divide, and oh

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.720
how successful he is on dividing people. And we've seen even in our own recent

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.040
history here in this country, we've seen the way in which the enemy seeks to

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.240
divide. But in Christ, we understand, listen, the Bible, what did Jesus say?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.200
The truth shall make you free. Man, I'm so thankful for the truth of God's Word.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.600
Remember what Jesus said in John chapter 4? I must needs go through Samaria.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.600
You know that the Jewish people hated the Samaritans. There was a, I mean, a

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.200
deep hatred that they had for the Samaritans, and you would find that they

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.040
would go out of their way, they would take more time to travel, even in adverse

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:18.880
circumstances, in order to avoid going through Samaria. But Jesus, he was

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.360
teaching a truth. He was teaching something to those disciples that they

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.200
needed to understand. Why? Because one day they would receive the Great Commission

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.120
where Jesus would say, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.040
come upon you, and you should be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.040
Judea. What is it? Samaria, and under the uttermost part of the earth, right? And so

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.200
they are to be witnesses. But they hated the Samaritans, and so as Jesus would

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.640
give that command, no doubt those disciples would be mindful of the

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.280
example of Christ back in John chapter 4, when he went through Samaria, and of

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.720
course we know that he met that woman at the well. And oh man, there's a lot

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.680
of people that got saved as a result of that, amen? There are many that came to

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.800
Christ, and what a blessing. And we need to be careful to understand the principle

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.200
that God has given us. Remember this, in Revelation 5, you don't need to turn

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.000
there, but in verse number 9, the Bible says, and they sung a new song saying,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.320
thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, for thou was

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.720
slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, notice this, out of every kindred

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.760
and tongue and people and nation in Christ, amen? I'm so thankful for the

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.000
principle that Paul begins this section with here in Colossians 3. Notice now, as

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.920
we get into this process, we've noted the plan. God's plan is that you and I would

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.440
be conformed to the image of his dear Son, that we would be like Christ. We find

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.960
that there's a principle, there's no partiality, that Christ is all and in all,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.400
and now we note the process. He says in verse number 12, put on, therefore, as the

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.000
elect of God, holy and beloved. That's our position, that's our standing. I'm

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.160
thankful to be saved, to know the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, and

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.840
then he's going to go through eight items that he's going to provide for us

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.160
in verse 12, 13, and 14. Notice with me as we take the bulk of our time this morning

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.040
to deal with each of these particular items that are referenced in these

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.360
verses of Scripture. In verse number 12, he starts out by saying this, bowels of

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.280
mercies. Bowels of mercies. Now you'd understand in this particular era, in

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.920
this particular culture, the bowels would be known as and referred to as the seat

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.720
of emotions. For us this morning, we would say from our heart, right? You hear

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.080
somebody say, I love you with all of my heart. It'd be really weird if somebody

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.720
said to you, in our culture, I love you with all of my bowels. You'd be like, what

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.960
in the world, right? But that was their understanding of the seat of emotions.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.119
And so we find for us, we would use the word

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:08.359
heart, and I just want us to make that connection this morning for us to

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:12.759
understand that Paul is saying bowels of mercies.

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:16.999
It really is the idea of having a heart of compassion.

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:20.599
A heart of compassion. You know I'm thankful this morning that our God is

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:24.759
compassionate, aren't you? The Bible declares to us that He's

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:27.879
compassionate. The Bible not only declares to us, but we

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:31.159
find that on a number of occasions during the life and ministry

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:35.239
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that He was moved with compassion.

00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:39.879
He was moved with compassion, and it is that heart of compassion that we

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:43.799
as the people of God, this idea of bowels of mercies, to be

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:47.879
merciful, pitiful, to have that heart of compassion. Notice

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.999
He continues and He says not only bowels of mercies, but

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:56.519
kindness. You know kindness seems to just be missing in our society today, amen?

00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:59.799
I mean people just don't know how to be kind to one another anymore,

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:03.879
and I like this explanation or definition of kindness.

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:10.599
This is delight in contributing to the happiness of others.

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:14.359
I like that definition of kindness. Delight

00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:18.039
in contributing to the happiness of others.

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:23.399
To be kind. Aren't you thankful that God is kind?

00:21:23.479 --> 00:21:28.919
The idea of kindness is goodwill or benevolence.

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:35.319
In Ephesians 4, in verse number 32, Paul says be kind one to another.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:39.079
Be kind one to another. And here he's saying that

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:43.079
we've put off some things, all of those items that were mentioned, and really

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:46.919
it's a great contrast if you look at the items that were mentioned to us

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:50.039
in verse 8 and 9 of those things that were to put off

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:53.799
anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication, and lying.

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.239
And you think about those items that were given to us, and now you

00:21:57.319 --> 00:22:01.319
contrast those with the list that we're going to look at this morning,

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:07.319
and it starts with bowels of mercies. Kindness. I mean how much opposite could

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:13.080
you be of anger and wrath and malice? And we're to put off those things, that's

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.479
the old man, that's the flesh, and we're to

00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:20.679
put on these things, we're to walk in the Spirit, we're to have the fruit of the

00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:24.679
Spirit. Notice he says this,

00:22:24.679 --> 00:22:28.679
humbleness of mind, number three in the list,

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:35.720
humbleness of mind, humility, lowliness of mind, it's the antithesis of pride.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:42.599
God says that he hates pride. Amen? That's what God says about pride.

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:49.239
God says this, that he is going to, he will give grace to the humble,

00:22:49.239 --> 00:22:53.319
but not to the prideful, right? He resisteth

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:56.919
the proud, but he gives grace unto the humble.

00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:02.919
By pride comes contention, by pride and haughtiness of spirit comes a fall.

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:08.199
We find that comes destruction and contention, and we find all of this with

00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:12.039
regard to pride, but no, this is

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:16.119
humbleness of mind, the antithesis of pride, the fact that we're to

00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:22.679
to be humble, to have that humility as a child of God. Notice in Philippians 2,

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:27.399
turn over if you will, I love the the book of Philippians,

00:23:27.399 --> 00:23:32.759
in the second chapter has great truth with regard to the subject of

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:36.919
humility, and I want you to notice as we look at

00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:38.919
this portion of scripture that we'll use,

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:43.319
the Lord Jesus Christ will be a great example that is given to us here in this

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:47.239
portion, but notice how Paul begins in verse number one to these believers in

00:23:47.239 --> 00:23:50.919
Philippi, if there be therefore any consolation in Christ,

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:54.199
if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit,

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:57.879
if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy,

00:23:57.879 --> 00:24:02.360
that you be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.399
Notice verse number three, let nothing be done through strife or vainglory,

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:11.239
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:15.239
better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things,

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:19.799
but every man also on the things of others.

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:23.959
And then Paul, after he gives this charge, this instruction, the believers

00:24:23.959 --> 00:24:27.320
here in Philippi, and he's encouraging them with the

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.359
idea of having unity, to be like-minded in verse number two, to

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:35.959
have humility, to put off strife and vainglory,

00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:40.199
that is referred to in verse number three, to have that humility again in

00:24:40.199 --> 00:24:42.440
verse number four, then he says in verse number five,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.119
let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:50.279
He's going to use the example of the Lord Jesus Christ, and he says here,

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:55.000
who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.279
but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:04.359
was made in the likeness of men. Being found in

00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:07.320
fashion as a man, notice he humbled himself,

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.639
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:18.600
I wonder how often we consider the humility of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.839
not only in his incarnation, but in his crucifixion.

00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:26.519
You think about the way in which he left the glory of heaven.

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:30.359
He left all that, he says in John 17, as he's praying,

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:33.479
before he would go to the cross, he says the hour has come,

00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:37.079
and he speaks about the glory that he enjoyed before,

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:41.880
by understanding the truth that he's eternal, that he is God.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.919
He is God in flesh, and he put off that glory, and he left the glories of

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:52.440
heaven, so that he could come and die for you,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.119
and die for me. What picture of humility.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:02.919
What example for us as the people of God. In fact, I believe that's the very thing

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:06.119
that Peter was referring to, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:10.600
that Peter says that we're to follow his steps, that he, the Lord, left us an

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.720
example. But as we find that in the context of

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.799
which Peter is referring to, he says, for even hereunto were you

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:20.839
called, because Christ also suffered for us,

00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:24.919
leaving us an example that you should follow his steps, who did no sin,

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:30.119
neither was guile found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again,

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:35.639
when he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:38.279
judgeth righteously, who his own self bear

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:42.040
our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.639
being dead to sin, should live unto righteousness,

00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:52.359
by whose stripes ye are healed." You know, the reality that we're saved

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:56.359
and that we're the people of God and home is our heaven,

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:59.880
that shouldn't lead us to a place of pride.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.440
If we're not careful, it can lead us to a place of looking down upon others that

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.399
they don't have the truth, they've not come to the truth, and

00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:10.519
we can become prideful in our position and in our

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:14.040
our understanding of the truth, but the reality is that,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.880
as the songwriter said, I'm a sinner saved by grace.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.079
Amen? I'm so thankful for the grace of God.

00:27:21.079 --> 00:27:25.720
Deborah sang this morning, Amazing Grace. It is amazing, is it not?

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.720
And I know for many that's a favorite hymn. I know

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.279
Mr. Don often will mention, even as you get anywhere within the 180s of our

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:38.199
songbook, why can't it be 187? Because that's Amazing Grace.

00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:42.519
There's nothing else in the 180s in our songbook that he would rather sing.

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:46.600
And the reality is that God's grace is amazing,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.359
but we find here that, as the people of God, we're to be clothed

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:55.720
in humility. We're to put on, as we find here in Colossians 3,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.320
not only bowels of mercies, not only kindness, but we find

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:06.519
humbleness of mind, the antithesis of pride. Oh, that it would not be said of

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:12.119
the people of God, of us individually here this morning, that we're prideful,

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:16.359
that we're prideful, because God resisteth the proud.

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:19.639
Not only does God resist the proud, but you understand that God knows how to

00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:24.519
humble you. The Bible tells us to humble ourselves

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:27.639
in the sight of God, but if you don't humble yourself, God

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:33.479
has a way of humbling you. Just talk to old Nebuchadnezzar. We

00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:36.440
won't take time to go to the book of Daniel this morning to look at that,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.039
but you understand that he was a prideful individual, the king

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:44.839
of Babylon, and God brought him low. God humbled that man.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:48.440
This morning, not only do we see these first three, but notice number four,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.839
meekness. Meekness there in verse number 12 still.

00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:57.080
Meekness is an interesting word. I believe that it can best be described or

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.440
defined as being a discipline of emotions.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.960
A discipline of emotions. A softness of temper.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.400
See, sometimes people equate meekness with weakness.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.479
People think somebody is meek and therefore they're weak, but reality is

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:15.400
that the idea, the understanding of the word meekness is that it

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.839
is that discipline of emotions. In other words,

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:22.760
power under control. Power under control.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.839
That's meekness. And again, as the people of God,

00:29:26.839 --> 00:29:31.000
we find that as Paul was going through and saying, put on therefore, again the

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.919
great contrast between the things that were to put off all these and

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:39.640
now we put on therefore these, and we find that meekness, the fact

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.479
that we would have a discipline of our emotions, that we would not have

00:29:43.479 --> 00:29:47.000
that wrath and anger and malice that was described

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
in verse number eight that were to put off. No, it's not that we just,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.400
you know, have this fuse and this temper that just is uncontrollable. No,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.520
we have temperance. We have meekness. It's power

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.159
under control. It's a discipline of our emotions.

00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:06.119
Can I tell you that you can only...

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:10.399
only do that through the power of the Holy Spirit. You can only do that through the power

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:14.799
of the Holy Spirit. As much as we try to discipline our own emotions, as much as we try to figure

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:19.479
out when something really bothers me and somebody pushes that wrong button and you know what

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:23.359
that means, I'm going to count to ten, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, I'm

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:29.519
going to go through all of these exercises so that I don't blow my cool. The power of

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:36.439
the Holy Spirit, walking in the Spirit, that's what we need, to put on this meekness. Notice

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:49.299
as we end verse number 12, use of the word long-suffering, patience, endurance, steadfastness,

00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:55.959
really carries with it the idea of not being easily provoked. This idea of being long-suffering,

00:30:55.959 --> 00:30:59.959
it's interesting how it will lead us into the phrases that are given to us in verse

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:04.839
number 13 and how important it is to understand this long-suffering that's being put on. I

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:10.199
really believe that as we think about these items that Paul is giving to the believers

00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:14.439
in Colossae that we're receiving from God this morning through His Word because all

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:18.359
Scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable. Listen, it's helpful for

00:31:18.359 --> 00:31:23.819
us to understand these things that as we take these five items that are mentioned in verse

00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:30.379
number 12 that through putting on those things it will help us to do what we're supposed

00:31:30.379 --> 00:31:37.179
to do according to verse number 13. If we don't put on bowels of mercies, kindness,

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:42.239
humbleness of mind, meekness in long-suffering, it's going to be real hard to forbear one

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:48.459
another. That's how he begins verse number 13, forbearing one another. You know what

00:31:48.459 --> 00:31:55.179
it means? Basically it means this, put up with each other. Put up with each other. You

00:31:55.179 --> 00:32:01.179
ever hear somebody say, I love you but I don't have to like you? That's nonsense. I don't

00:32:01.179 --> 00:32:04.339
know where that, listen, that's not Bible. You understand there's no Bible verse that

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:08.659
you can go to and say, well, this is, I have to love you in Jesus' name but I don't have

00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:16.059
to like you, bless God. No, that's not Bible. That's nonsense. That's making provision for

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:22.500
the flesh, honestly. The reality is that, look, if you look at those things that are

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.879
mentioned, those five items in verse number 12, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness

00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:29.979
of mind, meekness in long-suffering, do you find in there that you're not going to like

00:32:29.979 --> 00:32:35.739
somebody that's a child of God? Come on. If you're to put on these things, you're going

00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:39.539
to not only love them as we find in verse number 14, but you're going to be praying

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:42.860
one for another and you're going to be following these things and this thing of forbearing,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.379
listen, I understand that we're all different. I understand that people will make a phraseology

00:32:48.379 --> 00:32:53.220
every once in a while. Some people just rub me the wrong way or somebody's, but the reality,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.580
remember in Christ, remember we looked at that principle in verse number 12, Christ

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:04.019
is all and in all. And the reality is that all of those things are set aside because

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:08.699
now we're in Christ and as we're seeking that process of sanctification and each one of

00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:14.139
us are on our journey of sanctification becoming more like Christ and we're walking with God

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:18.179
and we're walking with Christ, you understand that there's sometimes that you might be further

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:22.019
along than someone else on that journey and there are times in which someone else might

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:26.580
be further along than you are on that journey. In the same grace that you would like to be

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.940
afforded to you, you need to afford to the person that's not as far along as you are.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:37.739
Amen? Now sometimes that's hard for us. Sometimes that's a challenge because we've not put on

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:44.539
all of these things that Paul is mentioning in verse number 13, forbearing one another.

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:50.699
I believe that that's the result not only specifically of longsuffering that we're not

00:33:50.699 --> 00:33:56.539
easily provoked, that we have that patience and that endurance, but that we have the bowels

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:01.940
of mercies, the kindness, the humility, and the meekness. You ever wonder why God puts

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:08.619
up with you? I mean, let's just bring it right down where it is, you know what I mean? Because

00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:13.019
sometimes, listen, when did Christ, according to Romans chapter number 5, God demonstrated

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:18.699
his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Amen? And yet

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:23.739
after salvation, how many times after salvation as we've dealt with this old man, this flesh,

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:28.619
this principle that's carried on throughout, starting in verse number 5 of Colossians 3,

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:31.899
going through what we're dealing with this morning, how many times have we failed our

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:38.260
Savior? How many times have we just royally messed up? And yet he's forgiving. He's putting

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:46.220
up with us. He's longsuffering toward us. He's kind toward us. He's merciful toward

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.820
us. And I'm so thankful for that. And we are, as the people of God, we're to put on these

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.059
things. We're to put these things on, forbearing one another. Notice as we continue through

00:34:57.059 --> 00:35:02.339
the list in verse number 13, we find the seventh item that is mentioned, really, the

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:09.220
truth here, forgiving one another. He says this, if any man have a quarrel against any,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:15.619
even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. The reality is that there will be times in

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:21.820
which there will be a quarrel against someone. Why? Because we have the flesh. Amen? I was

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.699
listening to a preacher preach. I was at a pastor's meeting. And sometimes you've heard

00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:29.139
these people that have said something of this nature. The guy that was the president of

00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:32.820
our Bible college, he would stand up and he'd say, we've been, my wife and I've been married

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:38.579
for 43 years and we've never had one argument, not ever one argument. And some of those kids

00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:42.979
in the college, we'd sit there and we'd listen and think, man, that's awesome. That's wonderful.

00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:47.459
And so on and so forth. And then others just wondering like, how in the world could that

00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:52.540
happen? Right? Like seriously? And this, this preacher was preaching at a pastor's meeting

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.739
just a couple of months ago. I was there down in, uh, just South of Spotsylvania and

00:35:56.739 --> 00:36:01.179
King George. And I was at the pastor's meeting. This fellow was preaching. And he said in

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:05.299
all the years that I've been married, I've never had one argument with my wife. He said

00:36:05.299 --> 00:36:11.220
never one time have I ever said anything to my wife that I'd regret. Not one time I ever

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:17.699
raised my voice to my wife. Oh man, this is great. Amen. Kevin's laughing back there.

00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:21.260
And then he said this, there have been plenty of times that I've not said a word to her

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.940
and I've not talked to her for days. And I thought, well, that's not the right answer

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.779
either. Amen. I mean, come on. And he was really building it up for this thing. But

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:36.100
the reality is that the answer is not like, you know, being angry and sin not, yeah, I

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:40.339
don't want to sin. I don't want to speak and sin. But at the same time, he says, let not

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:45.579
the sun go down upon my wrath. It's not that I'm going to go days on end without talking

00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:50.380
to someone that I'm going to allow the divide to become greater than I'm going to give place

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:55.820
to the devil. He gets that toe hold, which becomes a foothold, which becomes a stronghold.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.220
And we come to the place where we say, where did we get here? What happened anyway? We

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.459
think it was just this little thing. If there's a quarrel, he says, listen, we're forbearing

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:12.059
one another, but we're also forgiving one another. I'm so thankful for the teaching

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:18.979
in God's Word with regard to forgiveness. Isn't it wonderful, wonderful to be forgiven?

00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:24.660
I mean, honestly, to know that your sins are forgiven, to know that God has forgiven you,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:31.660
to understand, as we've said in the past, and you can sing the song, I'm forgiven forever.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:39.699
Man, that's a wonderful thing. That with thee, with our God, there is forgiveness. That he

00:37:39.699 --> 00:37:45.019
promises that if we confess our sins, that he will forgive us and cleanse us from all

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:50.059
unrighteousness. It's a wonderful thing to be forgiven. The problem that some people

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:55.739
have in their lives is not necessarily understanding that God has forgiven them, but perhaps forgiving

00:37:55.739 --> 00:38:01.979
themselves. The enemy, as the child of God, the accuser of the brethren, he tries to come

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:07.100
alongside and accuse us, but we say, listen, we have an advocate with the Father. It's

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:13.339
under the blood. I've been forgiven. Get thee behind me, Satan. Amen? I don't want to hear

00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:18.299
that anymore because I've confessed that, I've forsaken that, and God promised to forgive

00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:23.459
me. But then all of a sudden, somewhere along the line, sometimes we have a difficulty with

00:38:23.459 --> 00:38:32.459
forgiveness in our lives. Remember Peter? Lord, how oft shall we forgive? Till seven

00:38:32.459 --> 00:38:39.020
times? Now, we understand contextually, at that particular time, the kind of social norm

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.099
would be that if someone were to offend you in the same manner, three, maybe four times,

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:47.140
the Pharisees and those religious leaders of the day, they would say, okay, you can

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:52.539
forgive three or four times, but after that, I mean, you've crossed me one too many times.

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:58.059
So Peter, when he comes to Christ and he says, till seven times? He's really kind of saying,

00:38:58.059 --> 00:39:01.260
we're doing a little better than those religious leaders over there. I mean, you've called

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.700
them vipers, by the way, and so obviously they're not doing everything right, and so

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:19.339
till seven times? Jesus says no. Not till seven. Till 70 times seven. Wow. Till 70 times

00:39:19.339 --> 00:39:26.179
seven. 490. But the idea isn't that you get your little journal book out and keep a list

00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:31.500
of who's offended you and how many times. And man, they get up to like 482 and you're

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.179
like, oh man, they're getting close, I don't have to forgive them anymore, just a few more

00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:40.779
times. No. That's not the idea. It's to keep on forgiving.

00:39:40.779 --> 00:39:48.659
See, when Jesus said this to the disciples, another different way or a slightly different

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:55.260
way of God speaking to them with regard to forgiveness is found for us in Luke 17. And

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.659
he says, it says this, and if you trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven

00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:06.179
times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:08.419
So we find it says seven times a day.

00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:10.979
Now, I'm not sure about you, but perhaps if someone

00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:13.619
like three or four times in the same day offended you,

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:15.259
you might be like, I gotta find a different place

00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:17.999
to go today, like I gotta do something different.

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:21.239
But Jesus says, if seven times in the same day,

00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:25.899
that's what he says in Luke 17 and verse number four,

00:40:25.899 --> 00:40:27.699
in seven times in that day,

00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:30.339
he turns again to thee saying, I repent,

00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:33.719
thou shalt forgive him.

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:35.499
Have you ever failed God more than one time

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:36.879
in the same day?

00:40:36.879 --> 00:40:39.719
Sure you have, sure you have.

00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:44.119
Sometimes in the same way, right?

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:47.839
You know how the disciples respond,

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:50.679
the apostles responded to that teaching?

00:40:51.619 --> 00:40:54.759
The apostles said unto the Lord in verse number five,

00:40:54.759 --> 00:40:57.359
increase our faith.

00:40:58.239 --> 00:41:02.519
I believe contextually, that request is obviously made

00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:07.039
on the heels of that instruction with regard to forgiveness.

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:08.599
Forgiveness.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:12.719
And we find here that, again, back in Colossians three,

00:41:12.719 --> 00:41:16.719
that is, Paul would say in verse number 13,

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:20.359
not only forbearing one another, but forgiving one another.

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:23.319
But notice what he says at the end of the verse.

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:28.319
Even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

00:41:29.159 --> 00:41:33.319
The way that he says it to the believers in Ephesus,

00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:36.839
in Ephesians chapter number four, in verse number 32,

00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:39.639
he says, and be kind one to another, tenderhearted,

00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:43.059
forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake,

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:44.639
hath forgiven you.

00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:46.039
Why do we forgive?

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:47.439
Because we've been forgiven.

00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:52.339
You say, but they don't deserve it, neither do you.

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:56.659
I don't deserve God's forgiveness.

00:41:57.419 --> 00:42:00.179
But God is a forgiving God.

00:42:00.179 --> 00:42:02.019
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.239
You know, I believe that as we look at this list,

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:06.579
and we're gonna look at verse 14 here in just a moment,

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:08.739
but even as we just look at these first seven things

00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:12.099
that are mentioned, five of those items in verse number 12,

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:14.179
and then really the outworking, the forbearing,

00:42:14.179 --> 00:42:16.699
and the forgiving that's mentioned in verse number 13,

00:42:16.699 --> 00:42:20.259
I want you to consider that if we, as the people of God,

00:42:20.259 --> 00:42:23.579
would really put off all those things that are mentioned

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:25.899
in verses five through nine, and we'd really put on

00:42:25.899 --> 00:42:27.259
these things that are mentioned,

00:42:27.259 --> 00:42:29.659
I think we could make a difference in our world.

00:42:31.259 --> 00:42:32.219
I really do.

00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.539
Listen, I think that as we go,

00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:38.259
our message would be more readily received.

00:42:38.259 --> 00:42:39.099
Why?

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:41.139
Because we're walking in the Spirit.

00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:43.819
We're living the Christ life.

00:42:43.819 --> 00:42:45.939
We've been crucified to the old man,

00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:48.379
and now all of a sudden, we're able to have

00:42:48.379 --> 00:42:50.859
a greater impact and a greater influence.

00:42:50.859 --> 00:42:51.699
Why?

00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:54.819
Because we are merciful, we are compassionate,

00:42:54.819 --> 00:42:57.459
we're kind, we're humble, we're meek,

00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:01.579
we're long-suffering, we forbear, we forgive,

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:03.299
and as we understand those things and say,

00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:05.259
man, we're going to have an opportunity

00:43:05.259 --> 00:43:07.619
to make a difference in our world.

00:43:10.099 --> 00:43:12.059
I've heard people say over the years,

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:16.059
as you would speak to them about Christianity,

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:18.819
as you would speak to them about the Lord,

00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:21.259
that they've had encounters and experiences

00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:24.459
with individuals that claim the name of Christ,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.979
but were nothing like Christ,

00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:28.299
and therefore they have no interest

00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:30.419
in anything to do with the Bible.

00:43:30.419 --> 00:43:32.219
No, that's sad.

00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:33.059
That's sad.

00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:39.819
One world religious leader of years ago

00:43:41.699 --> 00:43:44.099
made this statement, not a Christian at all,

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:46.539
but made this statement as they examined

00:43:46.539 --> 00:43:48.659
and studied Christianity,

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:53.659
I like your Christ, but not your Christians,

00:43:53.659 --> 00:43:55.819
for they are nothing like your Christ.

00:43:57.459 --> 00:43:59.939
Man, that'll hit you.

00:44:01.299 --> 00:44:03.819
Because a Christian is supposed to be like Christ.

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:06.299
And how is it that we're going to be like Him?

00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:08.899
Well, Paul's giving us the application

00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:11.099
right here in this portion of Scripture.

00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:13.099
Listen, believers in Colossae,

00:44:13.099 --> 00:44:14.779
listen, church this morning,

00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:17.179
as we think about the truth of God's Word

00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:19.139
and we think about the way in which it's been preserved

00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:20.459
and it's for us this morning,

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:22.099
God has said, listen, you're saved,

00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:23.579
but there's some things you need to deal with

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.459
that old man, you need to put off these things.

00:44:26.459 --> 00:44:28.739
And there's some things you need to put on.

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:30.339
And as we walk in the Spirit

00:44:30.339 --> 00:44:33.139
and as we have the fruit of the Spirit

00:44:33.139 --> 00:44:35.299
that Paul mentions in Galatians 5,

00:44:35.299 --> 00:44:38.339
I believe that we'll be so much more effective

00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:43.019
on reaching people, on sharing Christ with people.

00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:45.459
Notice verse number 14 as he concludes.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.380
And above all these things, put on charity.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:59.500
Notice this, which is the bond of perfectness.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.899
As he speaks about charity, we understand the word love

00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:07.419
and we use that word and we understand the truth

00:45:07.419 --> 00:45:09.339
that is given and really the word for love

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.500
that is used here in this portion of Scripture

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.859
is the word that is used to describe God's love,

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:16.179
agape love.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.500
And we find that we're to,

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.820
above all these things, put on charity,

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.339
which is the bond of perfectness.

00:45:22.539 --> 00:45:25.660
I believe it's that evidence of maturity, if you will.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.220
And we think about this list

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.500
and we could even work backwards and work sideways

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.419
and just kind of interchange all of these things

00:45:32.419 --> 00:45:36.859
and understand how they're so dependent upon one another.

00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:39.419
Remember, as we look at this verse

00:45:39.419 --> 00:45:41.820
and think about the truth of charity, of love,

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.820
remember what Jesus said.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.419
Turn over to 1 Corinthians 13,

00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:48.419
but I'm gonna read to you John chapter 13.

00:45:48.419 --> 00:45:50.979
1 Corinthians 13, we'll look at some verses there

00:45:50.979 --> 00:45:52.259
as we conclude this morning.

00:45:53.179 --> 00:45:55.059
But I wanna remind you of what Jesus said

00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:57.739
in John chapter number 13.

00:45:57.739 --> 00:46:00.820
In John chapter number 13, in verse number 34,

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.899
Jesus, of course, had just finished washing

00:46:02.899 --> 00:46:05.739
the feet of the disciples and was giving them,

00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:08.539
the disciples, truth with regard to His soon

00:46:08.539 --> 00:46:10.059
going to the cross of Calvary.

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:10.899
And He says this,

00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:13.539
a new commandment I give unto you

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:17.979
that ye love one another as I have loved you

00:46:17.979 --> 00:46:21.899
that ye also love one another.

00:46:21.899 --> 00:46:23.419
How are we to love one another?

00:46:23.419 --> 00:46:25.539
As Christ loved us.

00:46:25.539 --> 00:46:27.579
How are husbands to love their wives?

00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:30.539
As Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.259
And we think about this great truth

00:46:33.259 --> 00:46:36.579
that He says that above all these put on charity,

00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:38.779
which is the bond of perfectness.

00:46:38.779 --> 00:46:41.859
And we find it in 1 Corinthians chapter number 13,

00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:43.979
a chapter that is given to the,

00:46:43.979 --> 00:46:47.459
really the supremacy of love, if you will, of charity.

00:46:47.459 --> 00:46:50.699
He says, though I speak with the tongues of men

00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:53.859
and of angels and have not charity,

00:46:53.859 --> 00:46:57.779
I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

00:46:58.979 --> 00:47:00.940
Though I have the gift of prophecy

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.419
and understand all mysteries and all knowledge.

00:47:03.419 --> 00:47:06.899
And though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains

00:47:06.899 --> 00:47:10.419
and have not charity, I am nothing.

00:47:11.739 --> 00:47:14.739
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor

00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:16.859
and though I give my body to the burn

00:47:16.899 --> 00:47:21.380
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.019
Then He describes charity, love.

00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:27.259
Suffereth long.

00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:29.859
We saw that in our list, did we not?

00:47:29.859 --> 00:47:30.820
Long-suffering.

00:47:32.779 --> 00:47:34.139
And is kind.

00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:35.619
Did we see that in our list?

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.419
Kindness.

00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:39.820
Charity envieth not.

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.539
Charity, notice this, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.

00:47:44.539 --> 00:47:46.019
Did we see that in our list?

00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:47.579
Humbleness of mind.

00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:53.380
Doth not behave itself unseemly, speaketh not her own,

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:57.619
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:00.699
We spoke about that not easily provoked

00:48:00.699 --> 00:48:02.820
being the truth of long-suffering.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.139
Behaveth itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,

00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:08.500
is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.779
I mean, think about how it's being described here.

00:48:11.779 --> 00:48:15.940
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.

00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:18.259
Beareth all things, believeth all things,

00:48:18.259 --> 00:48:20.739
hopeth all things, endureth all things.

00:48:20.739 --> 00:48:22.579
Charity never faileth.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.739
But whether they be prophecies, they shall fail.

00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.619
Whether they be tongues, they shall cease.

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:29.899
Whether it be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:31.779
And He talks about the fact that we know in part

00:48:31.779 --> 00:48:33.979
and we prophesy in part, but when he that is perfect

00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:37.579
is come, then that which is, excuse me,

00:48:37.579 --> 00:48:39.260
but when that which is perfect is come,

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.979
then that which is imperfect shall be done away.

00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:43.739
But I want you to think about the last verse.

00:48:43.739 --> 00:48:45.659
And now abideth faith, hope, charity.

00:48:46.339 --> 00:48:50.940
These three, but the greatest of these is charity, love.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.859
We're familiar with 1 Corinthians 13.

00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:57.299
It's a very common passage of scripture.

00:48:57.299 --> 00:49:00.020
We're familiar with the admonition that Jesus gives

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.739
to the disciples, that we're to love one another

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:02.940
as He loved.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.219
By this shall all men know that you're my disciples.

00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:13.979
I think about the terminologies in the first three verses

00:49:14.299 --> 00:49:17.179
that if I don't have charity, I'm become a sounding brass,

00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:18.299
a tinkling cymbal.

00:49:18.299 --> 00:49:21.099
I am nothing, it profiteth me nothing.

00:49:22.619 --> 00:49:25.179
I understand, I believe that you can develop

00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:28.979
a biblical principle to support this statement.

00:49:28.979 --> 00:49:32.260
It's not a verse of scripture, but I really believe

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.140
that if you look at the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.140
that you can support this quote or this statement.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.659
And someone said this years and years ago,

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:41.059
people don't care how much you know

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:42.299
until they know how much you care.

00:49:42.299 --> 00:49:44.179
How many of you ever heard somebody say that?

00:49:44.179 --> 00:49:47.020
Now, that's not a Bible verse, but I do believe

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.179
that if you look in the book of 1 Thessalonians

00:49:49.179 --> 00:49:52.059
and you find that Paul is speaking to those people

00:49:52.059 --> 00:49:54.820
in Thessalonica, and he says, I cared for you

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.339
as a nurse, cherisheth her children.

00:49:57.339 --> 00:49:59.059
And then he's delivering to them, he said

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:00.859
that I'm sending Timothy to perfect that

00:50:00.859 --> 00:50:02.859
which is lacking in your faith.

00:50:02.859 --> 00:50:05.500
Well, that's, I mean, if I don't know that you love me

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.339
and you're coming to me saying,

00:50:06.339 --> 00:50:10.539
and I got some areas in which I need to develop, I'm not all the way there, like I could take

00:50:10.539 --> 00:50:16.279
offense to that. But we don't see in any way that the believers in Thessalonica take offense

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:22.339
to anything that is said. Why? Because they knew that Paul loved them. He cared about

00:50:22.339 --> 00:50:25.979
them. You know, if we don't have charity, you ever try to talk to somebody and they

00:50:25.979 --> 00:50:32.779
just don't, they don't see your heart of compassion, of love? Someone asked me recently, trying

00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:39.779
to share the gospel with them. I said, why do you even care? That's what they said to

00:50:39.779 --> 00:50:46.659
me. What's in it for you? I said, honestly, nothing. There is absolutely nothing in it

00:50:46.659 --> 00:50:52.059
for me, aside from obedience, but my obedience has given you the truth. Whether you accept

00:50:52.059 --> 00:51:00.699
it or reject it, I'm not going to answer for that. Is that true? My job, my duty, my responsibility,

00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:06.539
what I'm accountable for is to give the truth. And here's what I told the individual, I'm

00:51:06.539 --> 00:51:13.859
going to heaven when I die, whether you get saved or not. But here's the thing, I understand

00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:20.979
the truth, and I want you to go to heaven when you die, because the alternative isn't

00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:29.179
so great, the lake of fire. But they looked at me with all seriousness, why do you care?

00:51:29.179 --> 00:51:34.779
What do you want from me? I don't want anything from you. Nothing. I just want you to be

00:51:34.779 --> 00:51:43.779
saved. I just want you to be saved. See, people need to see our love. They need to see that

00:51:43.779 --> 00:51:52.059
we're genuine. Notice what John says, he heard the Lord Jesus Christ give that new commandment,

00:51:52.219 --> 00:52:03.139
and he says this in closing in 1 John 4, in verses 7 and 8. 1 John 4, verses 7 and 8. Notice

00:52:03.139 --> 00:52:08.139
what John, who heard the Lord Jesus Christ give that new commandment, under the inspiration of

00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:15.939
the Holy Spirit of God, notice what he says. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is

00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:27.819
of God. And everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth

00:52:27.819 --> 00:52:44.339
not God, for God is love. Put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,

00:52:44.339 --> 00:52:52.339
long-suffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another. And above all these, put on charity,

00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:57.819
which is the bond of perfectness. Oh, we've learned some things over the last few weeks

00:52:57.819 --> 00:53:02.739
that we need to put off, but now this morning we learned some things we need to put on. There's an

00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:08.699
area in your life where the Holy Spirit of God just touched and said, this is an area, this put

00:53:08.739 --> 00:53:17.859
on area, this particular thing. God, help me. Help me to walk in the Spirit. Help me to have the fruit

00:53:17.859 --> 00:53:24.259
of the Spirit. Help me to be all that you've called me to be. Help me to be like your dear

00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:29.779
Son. See, that's God's plan, is that we'd be conformed to the image of His dear Son. Let's

00:53:29.779 --> 00:53:35.779
pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the Word of God and

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:42.339
for the truth that's contained therein. We thank you that you have provided to us in this portion

00:53:42.339 --> 00:53:50.299
of Scripture as your people, not only things that we need to put off, but now things that we need

00:53:50.299 --> 00:53:57.699
to put on. We're thankful that your plan is that we would be like Christ, conformed to the image

00:53:57.699 --> 00:54:05.019
of your dear Son. I thank you that you gave us that principle that there's no partiality. Christ

00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:13.419
is to have the preeminence. And in Christ, we are to be unified, brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:54:13.419 --> 00:54:24.699
What a joy. Because we notice this process that is given to us with this put on therefore. I thank

00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:31.699
you for working in my heart and my life. I pray God that as only you can, you would move and work

00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:40.019
and help us, Lord, to respond to how the Holy Spirit has spoken to us. That we'd allow you to

00:54:40.019 --> 00:54:47.579
have your will and way in our lives. That we would truly seek to be like Christ. That we could make

00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:53.819
the difference that you've called us to make, and if some have compassion, making a difference.

00:54:53.819 --> 00:55:00.459
Father, if there's one present that's never been saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:06.579
as their personal Savior. I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. They'd understand

00:55:06.579 --> 00:55:12.099
before they can do any of what we've talked about this morning, they must first be born again in

00:55:12.099 --> 00:55:23.459
Christ. And that today is the day of salvation. Their sin carries with it a wage. That wage is

00:55:23.459 --> 00:55:28.939
death, separation from God in the lake of fire. We're so thankful for the gift of God, which is

00:55:28.939 --> 00:55:35.419
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. I pray that you'd move and work as only you can. We'll

00:55:35.419 --> 00:55:39.179
give you the glory for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:55:39.179 --> 00:55:43.539
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano, and as she does,

00:55:43.539 --> 00:55:48.619
the altar is open. Maybe you need to come to this old-fashioned altar this morning. Maybe you need

00:55:48.619 --> 00:55:53.379
to make your pew an altar. But as the Holy Spirit of God has used the Word of God to minister to the

00:55:53.379 --> 00:55:58.059
people of God, let's do business with God as Kimberly plays.
