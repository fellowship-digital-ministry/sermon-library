1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
17 this evening, Exodus chapter 17.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,479
And if you were with us this morning, I kind of gave a segue at the end of the message

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,159
into the message this evening.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:15,119
It's not really a part one, part two, but it serves as and certainly could be a part

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,120
one, part two.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,479
Of course, as we look at Exodus 17, we've skipped a few events that have taken place

7
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:26,159
since the event that we looked at this morning in Exodus chapter number 14.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,639
But this morning we were challenged by the instruction that God provided to his servant

9
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:35,159
Moses to deliver to the children of Israel.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,880
And that instruction was found in Exodus 14 and verse number 15.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,840
When the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore cryest thou unto me, speak unto the children of Israel

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,799
that they go forward.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,840
And we dealt with the truth of the importance of going forward.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,360
We asked four questions this morning as we looked at that passage of scripture.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,759
We asked this question, why do we go forward?

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,400
Well, we go forward as a matter of obedience because the Lord has instructed us to go forward.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
How do we go forward?

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,680
We go forward by faith.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,760
The just shall live by faith and we believe that God is able to do what God said he would

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
do.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,199
We then asked this question, what hinders us from going forward?

22
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:23,040
We know that we've been instructed to go forward and we know how we're to go forward.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,080
But the reality is that there are times in our lives, no doubt, even as the children

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,839
of Israel would experience in events that would take place in their history, where we

25
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:40,000
are hindered from going forward, the doubts and the fears and the obstacles and the influence.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,199
And we looked at those things.

27
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:46,940
And then we asked the final question this morning, what happens when we go forward?

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,220
And very simply, we get to see the Lord work.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,419
And what a blessing to see God work, to see God do what only God can do.

30
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:59,940
And the children of Israel, they went forward and they got to see God perform miraculous

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,379
work in dividing the Red Sea and keeping the Red Sea parted and of course, overthrowing

32
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,699
the enemy.

33
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,699
And they rejoiced greatly in the 15th chapter of the book of Exodus.

34
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,500
In fact, the Bible begins in the 15th chapter and it says, they sang, then sang Moses and

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,179
the children of Israel, this song unto the Lord.

36
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:25,699
And Spake saying, I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously.

37
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:28,699
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

38
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,839
The Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation.

39
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,220
He is my God and I will prepare him in habitation.

40
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,940
My Father's God and I will exalt him.

41
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,259
And we find that as you go through the 15th chapter, they're singing and they're triumphing

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,339
and verse 21, it says that Miriam answered them, sing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed

43
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,699
gloriously.

44
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,220
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,539
And I mean, they're rejoicing and we get to see God work.

46
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:03,259
And we said this, that our faith too would be increased.

47
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:08,899
I mentioned this morning at the close of the service that oftentimes our faith is increased

48
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:12,300
through times of difficulty, through obstacles.

49
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,339
And we find that it's in those times in which our faith is often increased.

50
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:22,899
There are really the misunderstanding that many have that is if we follow God, if we

51
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:28,300
are obedient to God, if we're living by faith, if we go forward as we've been instructed

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,139
to do so, then we'll have no problems.

53
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,139
There'll be no difficulties.

54
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,539
There'll be no obstacles, no opposition.

55
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,539
Everything will be just perfect.

56
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,860
It's not that way.

57
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Come to the end of the 15th chapter, as I mentioned this morning, and the Bible tells

58
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,300
us that they found no water and then they went a little further and they went to Marah

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,979
and the waters there were bitter and they could not drink those waters.

60
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,580
The first obstacle that the children of Israel faced after they went forward, after they

61
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,820
obeyed the Lord, after in obedience and by faith, they did what God told them to do.

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,979
They were not hindered.

63
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:11,300
They went forward and they found themselves facing this obstacle.

64
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,339
The reality is that when we face obstacles in life, we must understand really two things

65
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,899
before we get to the 17th chapter.

66
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,220
I would say this, the obstacles that the children of Israel faced and the obstacles that we

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,019
face are known by God.

68
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,899
They're known ahead of time by God.

69
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,619
And I would say this, He has a purpose for them.

70
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:40,880
God was the one that led the children of Israel out of Egypt land.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,119
In the Old Testament, in this particular era, we find that the nation of Israel, they

72
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:50,679
were led by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

73
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:54,880
And we find that as God would provide them with leadership, even as we sang the song

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,399
this evening, follow on, follow on, and we find that they would follow God, that there

75
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:08,559
were times in which as they followed God, He led them directly into a time of testing,

76
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,200
a time of faith building.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,880
We find that these obstacles in which we deal with, the obstacles in which the children

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,679
of Israel would face, these obstacles, we must understand and recognize that they're

79
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:25,600
known by God and that they have a purpose.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,799
They have a purpose.

81
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:34,160
Let me say this, obstacles are not designed to detour us or to derail us.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,640
Rather, obstacles are to grow us.

83
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,399
They're to grow us.

84
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,720
And we find that the children of Israel, they face this obstacle at the end of chapter 15.

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,920
We mentioned about the manna this morning in chapter number 16, and you understand what

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
happens there.

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,519
And we come to the 17th chapter, after they had gone through and they've understood this,

88
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,839
the provision of God through the manna, they've seen God heal the waters there at Marah.

89
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,320
We find that the Bible tells us in chapter number 17, beginning in verse number one,

90
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,320
and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:17,200
sin after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord and pitched in Rephidim,

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,559
and there was no water for the people to drink.

93
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:27,839
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message, Pitched in Rephidim.

94
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,799
They pitched in Rephidim.

95
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:36,079
And that's the place where we find in verse number one, the Bible tells us the place in

96
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,399
which they would set up camp.

97
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,920
They pitched in Rephidim.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Now I want you to understand that as we look at this passage, and we'll look at the first

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,399
seven verses of Exodus chapter number 17, I want you to understand number one, the circumstances

100
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,079
that are provided.

101
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,519
God provides us with some circumstances right away in verse number one, and as we look at

102
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,799
these circumstances, we find that it's interesting to know that the Bible tells us that the congregation

103
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:09,000
of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Notice this next phrase right in the middle of verse number one, according to the commandment

105
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
of the Lord.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,079
I want you to understand that it was not Moses that just all of a sudden decided, we're going

107
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,600
to pick up camp and we're going to move.

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,760
It was not that they were following the leadership of Moses exclusively.

109
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,799
No, it was not the idea of some group of people, some group that came up with this

110
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:38,519
idea and this committee decided that we're going to move forward and we're going to go

111
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,679
over here and we're going to relocate.

112
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:49,239
No, the Bible tells us that they went according to the commandment of the Lord.

113
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,040
According to the commandment of the Lord.

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,200
They were obedient.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,040
They were, as we mentioned in chapter number 14, that command of go forward, and now we

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,480
find that they're going and they're obeying, they're following the leadership of God, and

117
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,399
the Bible tells us at the end of verse number one that they went according to the commandment

118
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,359
of the Lord and pitched in Rephidim, and it says this, and there was no water for the

119
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,760
people to drink.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,480
Now this is a problem.

121
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,839
The congregation of the children of Israel is a large congregation.

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,239
It's not a small group of people, as I mentioned this morning.

123
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,679
It's not just a handful of people that were crossing that Red Sea.

124
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:36,119
Really the estimates that are given are nearly two million people that would have crossed

125
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:40,000
over and that are being, of course, traveling at this point.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
You find that they come to a place and they pitch in this place, Rephidim, and there's

127
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,440
no water for the people to drink.

128
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,679
Now let me ask you this question.

129
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,679
Does God know that we need water?

130
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,880
He created us, right?

131
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,520
God knows that we need water.

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,880
He knows that it is a basic necessity for mankind, for human beings to survive.

133
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
It is necessary that we have water.

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,080
You can live longer without food than you can live without water.

135
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,080
It is a scientific, medical-proven fact.

136
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,000
We need water.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,039
In fact, there are times in which we understand, as we've lived and as we've experienced life

138
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,440
at certain levels and doing various activities, that there are times in which we can become

139
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,239
dehydrated.

140
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,559
I'm not sure about you, but I know of me.

141
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,919
If I'm doing something and I get to the place where I become dehydrated or even on the edge

142
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,880
of becoming dehydrated, I can feel that I need water.

143
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
I love sweet tea.

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,119
But there are times that I just need water.

145
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,039
God knows that we need water.

146
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,880
And He created us, but we find that when we consider the circumstances here in verse number

147
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
eight,

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
And He created us, but we find that when we consider the circumstances here in verse

149
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:01,880


150
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,180
and really get the backdrop to what's taking place,

151
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,680
that it is God that has led them here.

152
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
They're there in that place

153
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,880
according to the commandment of the Lord.

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,480
Now I mentioned this morning,

155
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,180
and I understand that there's this misconception

156
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,280
that many have that if we're obedient to God,

157
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,780
if we live by faith,

158
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,980
if we go forward as He's commanded us to do so,

159
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,080
that we're not going to have any problems.

160
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,880
That everything's just going to be perfect.

161
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,280
Well, they're in this place

162
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
according to the commandment of the Lord,

163
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,480
and there's no water.

164
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,280
God knows that they need water.

165
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,580
I want you to notice not only the circumstances,

166
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,780
but notice number two,

167
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,980
if you're taking notes,

168
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,480
the complaint of the people.

169
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
In verses 2 and 3, we read of the complaint,

170
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
the murmuring of the people of Israel.

171
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,280
It's one thing that they were consistently good at

172
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,180
was complaining.

173
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,380
Not much has changed in thousands of years

174
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,780
of human history,

175
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,280
for the reality is that it's very easy for us

176
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,080
as human beings to complain about our circumstances.

177
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,080
It's very easy for us to look at the negative aspect

178
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,680
of the circumstances in which we deal with,

179
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
and thus I believe it's so often

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,480
throughout the Word of God

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,980
that we are given the instruction

182
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,380
to rejoice evermore,

183
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,680
to be thankful,

184
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,080
to give thanks in all things,

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
because the reality is that

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,180
it is easy to complain.

187
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
In verses 2 and 3,

188
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,480
God records for us the complaint of the people.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,580
Notice in verse number 2, the Bible says,

190
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,080
wherefore the people did chide with Moses.

191
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
That word chide is an interesting word.

192
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
It means to contend or to argue with.

193
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
And look at what they said,

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
give us water that we may drink.

195
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,980
Can you imagine?

196
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,480
Can you imagine being Moses

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,780
and having this large group of people

198
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,280
nearly two million in size,

199
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,080
and you follow the direction of God,

200
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,080
you're in the place where God has led you to be,

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,780
and you're there and there's no water,

202
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,880
and the people now come and they're contending,

203
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
they're chiding with you,

204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,480
they're arguing with you,

205
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,279
and they say, give us water that we may drink.

206
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,580
And Moses said unto them,

207
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,180
why chide ye with me?

208
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,480
Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?

209
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,279
The people thirsted there for water.

210
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,779
The Bible says in verse number 3,

211
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,480
and the people murmured against Moses.

212
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,680
To murmur means to grumble or to complain.

213
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,680
They're complaining about their circumstances.

214
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,180
They said this at the end of verse number 3,

215
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,680
wherefore is this,

216
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,880
to kill us and our children

218
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,480
and our cattle with thirst.

219
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
Man, aren't they so negative?

220
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,279
Isn't it easy for us when we face adversity,

221
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,480
when we face obstacles,

222
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,580
when we face these types of circumstances

223
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,380
to just become super negative?

224
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,080
Think about all that they had experienced.

225
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Think about all that they've witnessed

226
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,180
and they've seen the hand of God.

227
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,680
Think about the message that I preached this morning

228
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,279
about the crossing of the Red Sea

229
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,580
and the miraculous power of God

230
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,279
that was displayed that these people saw firsthand.

231
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,880
Think about the time after crossing the Red Sea

232
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,480
or at the place of Marah

233
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
and there's bitter waters

234
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,980
and God heals the waters

235
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,580
and they're able to drink.

236
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,680
And think about the manna that they had had

237
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,880
to eat for breakfast that day,

238
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,980
to have as nourishment for that day.

239
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,980
They'd seen God work.

240
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,480
But they're thirsty.

241
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,779
And they chide.

242
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,080
And they murmur.

243
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,580
They were disappointed with their circumstances.

244
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
And I would say this,

245
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,680
their prior experience had not built their faith.

246
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,080
I wish I could read Exodus 17

247
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,580
and I understand that often as we look back,

248
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,779
even in our own lives,

249
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,580
but especially in the lives of others,

250
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,880
that it's very easy for us to say,

251
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,279
man, if they would have done this

252
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,580
or if they would have done that

253
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,080
and we can do that in our own lives

254
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,880
and we can look back at circumstances.

255
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
They say that hindsight is 20-20

256
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,779
and obviously when we look back

257
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,880
and we say, man, if I would have just trusted here,

258
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
if I would have had this perspective.

259
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,679
But wouldn't it have been interesting

260
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,580
if we could read Exodus 17

261
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,880
and read of the people

262
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,179
how that they just kind of got together

263
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,980
and said, I wonder how God's going to work

264
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,880
in this situation.

265
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,679
I mean, do you remember what God did

266
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,779
just a few days ago

267
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,279
when we crossed over the Red Sea?

268
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,080
Do you remember how God blessed

269
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,779
and how he worked and provided that water?

270
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,779
He healed those bitter waters.

271
00:14:58,779 --> 00:14:59,779
Do you remember that manna

272
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:00,779
that we've been enjoying?

273
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,580
I mean, what is God going to do?

274
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,080
How is God going to work?

275
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,480
We don't know what he's going to do,

276
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
but we know that there's no water

277
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,779
and we know that God made us.

278
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:10,880
He formed us.

279
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,380
He knows what our needs are.

280
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,080
He knows that we need water.

281
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,380
And how is God going to provide?

282
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,080
What is God going to do

283
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,179
and have some measure of excitement

284
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,679
and anticipation and expectation

285
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,380
of seeing God work?

286
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,779
Unfortunately, we don't read it that way.

287
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,480
We read it just as I read it a few moments ago.

288
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,980
They chide.

289
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,679
They murmur.

290
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,580
They grumble and they complain.

291
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Why have you brought us out of Egypt?

292
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,179
Why have you done this?

293
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,980
And I can almost see Moses

294
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,779
as he's receiving the chiding

295
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,779
and the murmuring as the people

296
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,080
are angered and disappointed

297
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,980
and they're thirsty,

298
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,679
that Moses is almost beside himself.

299
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,580
I mean, it's God that brought us here.

300
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Did you not see the pillar?

301
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Right?

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,679
Can you imagine?

303
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,279
I mean, this pillar of cloud by day,

304
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,679
this pillar of fire by night,

305
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,980
I mean, when it moves, we move.

306
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,080
When it stops, we stop.

307
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,880
Right?

308
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,779
And here, the people,

309
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,779
I believe that it's so representative

310
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,480
of human nature throughout human history.

311
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
It's easy for us to criticize the children of Israel.

312
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,480
It's easy for us to critique their lack of faith

313
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,080
and their lack of expectation,

314
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,179
their lack of trusting God.

315
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,380
It's easy for us to criticize and to critique.

316
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,580
It's easy for us to say if they would have

317
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,179
and why didn't they?

318
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,779
But the reality is that if we would

319
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,480
just evaluate our lives

320
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,380
with the same level of standard

321
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,679
that we evaluate the children of Israel,

322
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,179
we'd find that we too fall short.

323
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,179
We too fail to trust God when we should.

324
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,580
We too murmur and complain

325
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,480
and get disappointed with our circumstances

326
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,380
and fail to have our faith increased

327
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,480
by prior experiences.

328
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,980
The circumstances, the complaint,

329
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,580
notice as we continue through the passage of Scripture

330
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,080
in verse number 4, number 3,

331
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
if you're taking notes,

332
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I want you to note the cry of Moses.

333
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,279
I love the response of Moses here

334
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,380
in verse number 4, by the way.

335
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,880
And what a proper response this is.

336
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,679
The Bible says,

337
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,580
"...and Moses cried unto the Lord,

338
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,880
saying, What shall I do unto this people?

339
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,480
They be almost ready to stone Me."

340
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
These people are upset. They're angry.

341
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,380
They're ready to kill Moses

342
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,679
because of their circumstances.

343
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,980
And we read the cry of Moses.

344
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,580
We read where the Bible says

345
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,580
that Moses cried unto the Lord.

346
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,179
What a great response

347
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,080
when the people are chiding with him,

348
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,580
when the people are murmuring against him,

349
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,880
that Moses goes to God.

350
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,779
Moses understood that it was God

351
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,580
that had provided the direction.

352
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,779
Moses understood that he was simply

353
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,080
following the leadership that God had provided.

354
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Moses understood that God had taken care of them

355
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
and God had provided for them

356
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,580
and God had worked miraculously.

357
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,780
And there were some things

358
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,179
that Moses had learned about God

359
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,179
and what he was capable of doing.

360
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,080
And so the response of Moses is here

361
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,280
in verse 4.

362
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,679
It's the cry of Moses.

363
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,679
We understand that he's the human leader

364
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,979
of the children of Israel

365
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,380
at this particular time.

366
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,280
And what a great lesson for leadership

367
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,580
and the dependence of the leader,

368
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,780
the spiritual leader,

369
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,280
the dependence upon God.

370
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,580
We speak about leadership

371
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,380
and we think about spiritual leadership.

372
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,580
I do not believe that it would be inappropriate

373
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,679
for us to make application this evening

374
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
not only as we would think about

375
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,880
the leadership of Moses

376
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
with the children of Israel,

377
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
but perhaps as we'd look at the leadership

378
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,280
of a pastor in a church family

379
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
and God has given a certain responsibility

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
to the pastor as the under-shepherd

381
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,880
and to provide leadership and direction

382
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,979
as I seek to follow God

383
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:33,479
and to provide that vision and that leadership

384
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:37,280
and how desperately I need God.

385
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,580
But let's take it a step further

386
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,479
and think about the families

387
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,179
because the reality is that a church,

388
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,179
a strong church,

389
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,780
is made up of strong families.

390
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,580
And God has given the responsibility

391
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,880
to the husband to be the leader of the home.

392
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,580
And as we think about the leadership

393
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,179
that God desires for men

394
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,080
to provide in the home,

395
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,880
we find that it's absolutely...

396
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,840
essential that men would be dependent upon God, and that we'd understand that we have

397
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,680
to follow God as we lead our families, that we'd understand that this is a difficulty

398
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,360
and that there are challenges and there are obstacles, and I need the leadership and the

399
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,960
direction that God would provide, and oh, that we'd cry out unto the Lord.

400
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,480
I love the cry of Moses. I believe that his response to the events that are taking place

401
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:42,840
are exemplary. I believe that they're appropriate. I love that he seeks God and he says, what

402
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:51,240
shall I do unto this people? What should I do? I love the fact that Moses cries out unto

403
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,440
the Lord because it's then that we receive the response that God provides. How often

404
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:09,120
do we fail to get instruction from God because we simply don't ask Him? How often do we falter

405
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,640
and fail and flounder around because we don't have wisdom that we need, but yet God said

406
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,920
if any lack wisdom, let them ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth

407
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,320
not, and yet there are times in our lives where we simply fail to ask and therefore

408
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,720
we don't receive. You have not because you ask not. God wants to provide direction for

409
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,640
our lives. He wants to give answers. He wants to provide leadership, and we find that the

410
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,760
truth of verse number 4 is so impactful in our lives because he's crying unto the Lord

411
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,040
and we see the cry, but we find the great impact that this response of Moses has because

412
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,280
it's then that we come to verse number 5 and the Bible says that the Lord said unto

413
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,880
Moses. We see number 4, if you're taking notes, if you're taking notes number 4 this evening,

414
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:17,919
the command of the Lord. The command. I want you to notice that verse number 5 is the result

415
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,800
of verse number 4. The command is the result of the cry. Because Moses cries out unto the

416
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,360
Lord, because Moses says what shall I do unto this people, Moses is acknowledging his lack

417
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,320
of understanding with what to do and how to operate and how to function. He's acknowledging

418
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,160
to God that I need you, I need your wisdom, I need your direction and we find that God

419
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,960
responds and how thankful we are this evening that our God hears and answers prayer. That

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,760
we can cry unto Him and we can have confidence that He hears us and we can have confidence

421
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,440
that He answers and the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses. Notice the command in

422
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,680
verse 5 as we would think about the response and God giving Moses the direction. The Bible

423
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:20,120
says go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith

424
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:28,960
thou smotest the river, take in thine hand and go. As I read verse number 5 I recognize

425
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,440
some specific aspects of what God tells Moses to do. He tells Moses to go on before the

426
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,639
people. He tells him, however, to take with thee of the elders of Israel. And so Moses

427
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:47,520
was not to go by himself, there to be some people with him, some of the elders of Israel

428
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,639
and you find that he tells them, God says, you know, take these elders but also that

429
00:23:52,639 --> 00:24:02,120
rod, the rod that you smote the river with, take that in thine hand and go. Go where?

430
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Notice verse 6, the command continues, he says this, behold, God speaking, the Lord

431
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:17,440
speaking to Moses, he says, behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb

432
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:29,399
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink.

433
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:35,000
This is not an unfamiliar passage of Scripture. We are familiar with the account. We know

434
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,679
what takes place, many of us. God says, go on before the people, take the elders of Israel

435
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,600
with you, take your rod with you, I'm going to go before you and I'm going to stand on

436
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,440
a rock in Horeb and with that rod you should smite the rock and out of that rock will come

437
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:07,880
water that the people would drink. Can you imagine? The command, the instruction, the

438
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:17,720
direction, Moses says, Lord, what do I do? The people are ready to stone me. God knows

439
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,119
that the people need water. The people are very disappointed with their circumstances.

440
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:29,160
They've complained and they've murmured, they've chided with Moses and they feel like again,

441
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,360
they're going to die. You brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our

442
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:41,279
cattle with thirst. This was the purpose of our journey. This is why we left. And Moses says,

443
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,320
God, I don't know what to do. And God says, here's what to do. And He gives them a command.

444
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,800
Now, we stopped right in the middle of verse number 6 and we'll finish it up here in just a

445
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:01,200
moment. But I want you to think about the situation. And if you can, just for a moment,

446
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:11,279
put yourself in the shoes of Moses. I've sought to explain the passage as best I can so that in

447
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,640
our sanctified imaginations, we can be there and we can see the circumstances and we can

448
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,760
understand what's taking place. And Moses to go on before the people and take the elders and his

449
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,640
rod. And God's going to go to a rock in Horeb and he's going to smite that rock and there's

450
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,119
going to be water that comes out. And I want you to think just for a moment of these circumstances

451
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:43,399
and I want you to think about the command of God. And I want you to think about the message

452
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:51,279
that I preached this morning of go forward. And there are times, as I mentioned this morning,

453
00:26:51,279 --> 00:27:00,959
in our third point, what hinders us from going forward. See, Moses had been given some direction

454
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:12,760
of God to go on before the people. And Moses would have to go how? By faith. He'd have to go why?

455
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,279
Out of obedience, right? It's God that told him. It wasn't Moses that just came up with this idea

456
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,239
that I'm going to go smite some rock and water's going to come out of it. No, why did he go do what he did?

457
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:34,640
He went because he was obeying God. How did he go? He had to go in faith. I don't believe,

458
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,640
I don't know of any other record prior to this where a rod had smitten a rock and water

459
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:51,720
came out of it to take care of the thirst of nearly two million people. God didn't say,

460
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,559
Moses, I'm going to take you to another body of water and just as I healed waters back

461
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:03,800
in Marah, I'll heal those waters so you can drink them. God didn't tell him that. And

462
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,080
I want you to just put yourself in the shoes of Moses just for a moment. And I want you

463
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:22,440
to ask yourself the question, would you go? Would you go? Would you be obedient to God

464
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,380
to go on before the people with the elders with the rod to the rock where God would stand

465
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:33,640
and smite that rock and water come out? Would you go? Would you obey? Would you have the

466
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,919
faith to trust that God would do what God said He would do? Because every time God gives

467
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:51,760
a command, there's a decision that has to be made. A decision has to be made. We can

468
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:01,359
obey the command or we can disobey the command. Right? Any command. We find that there are

469
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:08,000
consequences of our decision. The decision to obey leads typically to blessing as we

470
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,679
read in Deuteronomy 11. The decision to disobey leads to cursing again as we read in Deuteronomy

471
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:21,840
11. We see it in our own lives and in parenting with children, we tell Johnny or Susie to

472
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,039
do such and such and we give them instruction and direction and they say, I'm not going

473
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:35,720
to do it. Really? Let me help you make a better decision. But when we think about this

474
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:44,239
situation with Moses, the command has been given. Moses, go on before the people. Take

475
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:52,000
the elders. Take your rod. I'm going to go before you. I'll stand before thee there upon

476
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,760
the rock in Horeb and Moses, you should smite the rock and water will come out that the

477
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,679
people may drink. What's Moses going to do? We know what he does.

478
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,199
recorded history, and it's an event that took place thousands of years ago.

479
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:11,439
But I wonder if just for a moment this evening we can put ourselves

480
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,959
into the account.

481
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,759
Or maybe we just put ourselves into some

482
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,919
daily obedience to God.

483
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,039
When God gives us direction, and

484
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,919
even as we mentioned this morning about the marching orders for the church, that

485
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,279
His last command before His ascension continues to be

486
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,639
the mission of the church.

487
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,559
When God, through His Spirit, prompts us to talk to that person, to give that

488
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,359
person a gospel tract, to be that witness,

489
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:55,119
how do we respond? What do we do?

490
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,759
As we look at the command of the Lord in verses 5 and part of verse number 6,

491
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,799
we must pause and consider how it is that we too would respond.

492
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,559
What if we were in that situation? What if I were Moses? What if you were

493
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
Moses?

494
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,799
As we conclude this evening and finish up verse 6 and look at verse 7,

495
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,519
number 5, if you're taking notes, I want you to see the confidence of Moses.

496
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,519
I want you to see the confidence of Moses.

497
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:39,439
The last phrase of verse number 6 is so impactful to me, it's convicting to me.

498
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,399
Such a great testimony for this man Moses.

499
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:55,279
The Bible simply says this, and Moses did so in the sight of the elders

500
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:03,279
of Israel. He did so. He obeyed. I believe that he obeyed

501
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,479
because his confidence and thus the point, the confidence of Moses,

502
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:14,239
he was confident, he had faith that God would do what God said He would do.

503
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:20,479
He believed that God would give that water, that as he went on before the

504
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:24,159
people and he took the elders and they said, where are we going? And I don't

505
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,079
know that they said that, but just for a moment, if we could put

506
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,559
ourselves within the account and understand the circumstances. And

507
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,239
he goes, Moses, what are you doing? Moses, why are we going? Moses, what are you

508
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:39,199
doing? And Moses says, I believe God, this is

509
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:43,119
how He's going to provide. And he goes to that rock and he smites the

510
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,399
rock. Can you imagine when the water gushed

511
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,679
out? It simply says, and Moses

512
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,959
did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

513
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,039
I'm challenged by the fact that it says that he did so in the sight of the

514
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,079
elders of Israel. We understand that that's at the command

515
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,319
of God, according to verse number five, but no doubt there are times in which

516
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,479
perhaps we would say, well, let me just do this kind of in

517
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:22,239
privacy in case maybe it doesn't work out right, that way I'm not embarrassed.

518
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:28,000
No, no, Moses had confidence. Moses just simply believed that God would do what

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,519
God said He would do. And here the Bible tells us in verse

520
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,559
number seven, and he called the name of the place

521
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,639
Massa and Meribah because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because

522
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,319
they tempted the Lord, saying, is the Lord among us or not? And we find

523
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,039
that here in verse number six, when he did what God told him to do, that the

524
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,319
Bible tells us that God would provide water.

525
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,439
He said, when you smite the rock, that there shall come water

526
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:04,399
out of it that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders

527
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:12,239
of Israel. God provided miraculously the

528
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,599
confidence of Moses.

529
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,679
Moses had never witnessed this specific miracle

530
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,600
to the best of our knowledge as we study Scripture.

531
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,440
He had seen God part waters. He had seen God

532
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,559
heal waters. To the best of our knowledge, he had never seen God provide water out

533
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,119
of a rock.

534
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,559
But he believed God. He had confidence in God.

535
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,320
He had witnessed the hand of God. He had observed

536
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,199
the moving of God many times in his life, and therefore he believed that God

537
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,359
could do it. I believe that he's fully confident. He's

538
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,959
fully persuaded that God is able. And this evening,

539
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:09,440
as we think about our own lives, as we think about the

540
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:16,239
the truth of living in this time, in this place, we think about the

541
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,239
obstacles and the difficulties in which we face.

542
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,359
How is it that we deal with those obstacles and those difficulties?

543
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,440
Are we in the place of God? Are we doing what God's commanded us to do?

544
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,160
Are we following the direction of God? And if we are, we understand that there

545
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,359
are times that we'll face obstacles. But

546
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,160
remember, those obstacles are not designed to detour us or to derail us.

547
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,880
Those obstacles are designed to grow us and

548
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,479
to develop us. And we find that there are times in which we

549
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:53,039
are following the Lord exactly as he's given us the direction,

550
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,759
exactly as he's provided us the command, and we're doing exactly what God wants

551
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:03,119
us to do. And there are obstacles.

552
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,679
We're going forward, but there are challenges.

553
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,559
There's opposition. The obstacles are there.

554
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:19,440
The hindrances are there. But we've made that determination. We are resolved

555
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,880
that we will go forward at the command of the Lord.

556
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,799
And that we will have confidence in our God that he is able, that we are

557
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,279
obeying him and we are taking him at his word.

558
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:36,320
We are living by faith. That's what faith is, just believing God.

559
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,720
Believing that God will do what God said he would do.

560
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,440
And I find that as we live in this time, in this era, in our own lives,

561
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,199
as we think about the circumstances of the children of Israel as they're

562
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,759
described to us here in this passage of scripture,

563
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,679
and as we would examine and deal with our own lives, we could respond the way

564
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,639
that the children of Israel do. And we could just sit around and complain and

565
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,600
murmur and chide with, and be disappointed with, and give all

566
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,639
sorts of reasons and explanations as to why we can't,

567
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,720
why we shouldn't, and so on and so forth.

568
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,559
I'm thankful that Moses cried out unto the Lord.

569
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,239
And I'm thankful that God answered. Oh, that we'd seek the face of God.

570
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,839
God, how do we navigate these times? We're living in days of difficulty and

571
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,039
days of obstacles and challenges, and we can't quite do the things that we

572
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,479
used to do. We have these obstacles, and God, how do

573
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:39,440
we go forward? How do we reach people? How do we

574
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,359
interact with people? We're to reach a lost and dying world, and we

575
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,359
understand that we have been given the glorious message of the

576
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,559
gospel, the greatest message that could ever be given,

577
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,839
and we've been entrusted with that message.

578
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,119
And it's not that we would hold it and keep it to ourselves, but that we'd give

579
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,880
it to a lost and dying world. We say, but there are obstacles. I know

580
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,759
that you go out just as I go out, and people are less

581
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:11,359
interested in talking than they ever have been.

582
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,919
People are fearful. They want to back away. They don't get too close, and so on

583
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:20,000
and so forth. We've got to reach them. We've got to

584
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,479
reach them. We've got to go forward, and we've got to

585
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:29,679
pray and ask God, God, what do we do? How do we

586
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:36,880
reach a community, a city, a country,

587
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,359
a world with the gospel of Jesus Christ? How do we do it?

588
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,919
Remember as we read this morning in Matthew 28,

589
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,839
he said, all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

590
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,760
Go ye therefore. And as we read the command of the commission to preach the

591
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,760
gospel, to baptize, and to disciple, he says this, and lo

592
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,359
I am with thee always. I'm so thankful that he promises to

593
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,399
be with us, to give us the strength, the wisdom,

594
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:22,719
the direction that we need. And because Moses cried out unto the Lord,

595
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,119
God gave him the answer. Here you go, Moses.

596
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,799
Here's how we're going to provide water for all these people. Here's how I'm

597
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:33,919
going to provide water for all these people.

598
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:38,960
And Moses, I'm going to use you. Go over here,

599
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,799
do this, and I'll do this. And Moses went, and God did.

600
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:52,719
Isn't that exciting? This evening they pitched in Rephidim.

601
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,320
They went at the commandment of the Lord. They obeyed God.

602
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,200
They were not in the wrong place. They were where they were supposed to be.

603
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,760
There was no water.

604
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,400
God said, through this obstacle,

605
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,680
I'm going to prove my power again

606
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,880
to once again seek to develop you,

607
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,840
to grow you through this time of difficulty.

608
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,280
I don't know what obstacle you face personally.

609
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,720
I don't know what difficulty you're facing,

610
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,840
but I know that God is able.

611
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,160
And I know that God continues to work in this manner,

612
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,160
for often we find even in the New Testament,

613
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,760
the last Sunday school lesson that we had a couple of weeks ago,

614
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,960
Jesus tells the disciples to go on the ship and go to the other side.

615
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:49,200
It was there that they faced a terrible storm.

616
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,440
It was there that they got to see the power of God.

617
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
What manner of man is this?

618
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,080
Even the winds and the waves obey.

619
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,440
He's God.

620
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,640
He's God.

621
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,880
And He wants to work in and through us.

622
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,240
There never would have been water that came from the rock

623
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,560
if Moses had not cried out unto the Lord,

624
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,720
and if Moses had not obeyed the Lord.

625
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm thankful that Moses, he cried out,

626
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,320
and then I'm thankful that he obeyed.

627
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,800
Because we get to read an account such as this and rejoice.

628
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,160
Man, this is wonderful.

629
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,520
Look at what God did.

630
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
But how do we apply it in our lives?

631
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh, that we trust God, and that we'd follow Him,

632
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,120
and that we'd see Him work mightily.

633
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,080
Father, we love You.

634
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,280
We thank You for loving us.

635
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,320
As we look at this passage of Scripture this evening,

636
00:41:51,320 --> 00:42:01,760
we're encouraged to be reminded of Your power.

637
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,520
God, we're challenged as we review and examine our own lives

638
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
to consider the level of obedience that we have,

639
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,720
the level of faith that we have

640
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,080
in trusting You and following You.

641
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,000
We pray, God, that You'd help us to go forward.

642
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
That's the first sign of trouble,

643
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,000
that we would not retreat,

644
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,360
that we would not chide and murmur.

645
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,680
God, that we'd trust You.

646
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,200
With great levels of anticipation and expectation,

647
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,560
we would long to see You work.

648
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:55,440
To see what and how You will do what only You can do.

649
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,000
Would You help us to go forward?

650
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,240
Because You've commanded us to,

651
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,720
it's a matter of obedience.

652
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,440
Help us to go forward in faith.

653
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,920
Help us to see You work as only You can.

654
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,200
We pray that in these few moments of invitation

655
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,520
that You'd have Your will in way,

656
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,280
that Your Spirit would move in the hearts

657
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,080
of those that are gathered locally

658
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,560
and those that have tuned in on this service tonight.

659
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,520
That, God, we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

660
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,040
Well, thank You for the work that You'll do.

661
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
