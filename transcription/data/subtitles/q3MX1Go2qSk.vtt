00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
17 this evening, Exodus chapter 17.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.479
And if you were with us this morning, I kind of gave a segue at the end of the message

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.159
into the message this evening.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:15.119
It's not really a part one, part two, but it serves as and certainly could be a part

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.120
one, part two.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.479
Of course, as we look at Exodus 17, we've skipped a few events that have taken place

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:26.159
since the event that we looked at this morning in Exodus chapter number 14.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.639
But this morning we were challenged by the instruction that God provided to his servant

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:35.159
Moses to deliver to the children of Israel.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.880
And that instruction was found in Exodus 14 and verse number 15.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.840
When the Lord said unto Moses, wherefore cryest thou unto me, speak unto the children of Israel

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.799
that they go forward.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.840
And we dealt with the truth of the importance of going forward.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.360
We asked four questions this morning as we looked at that passage of scripture.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.759
We asked this question, why do we go forward?

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:04.400
Well, we go forward as a matter of obedience because the Lord has instructed us to go forward.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.519
How do we go forward?

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.680
We go forward by faith.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.760
The just shall live by faith and we believe that God is able to do what God said he would

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.760
do.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.199
We then asked this question, what hinders us from going forward?

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:23.040
We know that we've been instructed to go forward and we know how we're to go forward.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.080
But the reality is that there are times in our lives, no doubt, even as the children

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.839
of Israel would experience in events that would take place in their history, where we

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:40.000
are hindered from going forward, the doubts and the fears and the obstacles and the influence.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.199
And we looked at those things.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:46.940
And then we asked the final question this morning, what happens when we go forward?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.220
And very simply, we get to see the Lord work.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.419
And what a blessing to see God work, to see God do what only God can do.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:59.940
And the children of Israel, they went forward and they got to see God perform miraculous

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.379
work in dividing the Red Sea and keeping the Red Sea parted and of course, overthrowing

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:06.699
the enemy.

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:10.699
And they rejoiced greatly in the 15th chapter of the book of Exodus.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:16.500
In fact, the Bible begins in the 15th chapter and it says, they sang, then sang Moses and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.179
the children of Israel, this song unto the Lord.

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:25.699
And Spake saying, I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.699
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:33.839
The Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation.

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.220
He is my God and I will prepare him in habitation.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.940
My Father's God and I will exalt him.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.259
And we find that as you go through the 15th chapter, they're singing and they're triumphing

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.339
and verse 21, it says that Miriam answered them, sing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.699
gloriously.

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.220
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.539
And I mean, they're rejoicing and we get to see God work.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.259
And we said this, that our faith too would be increased.

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:08.899
I mentioned this morning at the close of the service that oftentimes our faith is increased

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:12.300
through times of difficulty, through obstacles.

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.339
And we find that it's in those times in which our faith is often increased.

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:22.899
There are really the misunderstanding that many have that is if we follow God, if we

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:28.300
are obedient to God, if we're living by faith, if we go forward as we've been instructed

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.139
to do so, then we'll have no problems.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.139
There'll be no difficulties.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.539
There'll be no obstacles, no opposition.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.539
Everything will be just perfect.

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:41.860
It's not that way.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.660
Come to the end of the 15th chapter, as I mentioned this morning, and the Bible tells

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.300
us that they found no water and then they went a little further and they went to Marah

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.979
and the waters there were bitter and they could not drink those waters.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.580
The first obstacle that the children of Israel faced after they went forward, after they

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.820
obeyed the Lord, after in obedience and by faith, they did what God told them to do.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.979
They were not hindered.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:11.300
They went forward and they found themselves facing this obstacle.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.339
The reality is that when we face obstacles in life, we must understand really two things

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.899
before we get to the 17th chapter.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:25.220
I would say this, the obstacles that the children of Israel faced and the obstacles that we

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.019
face are known by God.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.899
They're known ahead of time by God.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.619
And I would say this, He has a purpose for them.

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:40.880
God was the one that led the children of Israel out of Egypt land.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.119
In the Old Testament, in this particular era, we find that the nation of Israel, they

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:50.679
were led by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.880
And we find that as God would provide them with leadership, even as we sang the song

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.399
this evening, follow on, follow on, and we find that they would follow God, that there

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:08.559
were times in which as they followed God, He led them directly into a time of testing,

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.200
a time of faith building.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.880
We find that these obstacles in which we deal with, the obstacles in which the children

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.679
of Israel would face, these obstacles, we must understand and recognize that they're

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:25.600
known by God and that they have a purpose.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.799
They have a purpose.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:34.160
Let me say this, obstacles are not designed to detour us or to derail us.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.640
Rather, obstacles are to grow us.

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:40.399
They're to grow us.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:44.720
And we find that the children of Israel, they face this obstacle at the end of chapter 15.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.920
We mentioned about the manna this morning in chapter number 16, and you understand what

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
happens there.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.519
And we come to the 17th chapter, after they had gone through and they've understood this,

00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:01.839
the provision of God through the manna, they've seen God heal the waters there at Marah.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:06.320
We find that the Bible tells us in chapter number 17, beginning in verse number one,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.320
and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.200
sin after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord and pitched in Rephidim,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.559
and there was no water for the people to drink.

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:27.839
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message, Pitched in Rephidim.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.799
They pitched in Rephidim.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:36.079
And that's the place where we find in verse number one, the Bible tells us the place in

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.399
which they would set up camp.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.920
They pitched in Rephidim.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.920
Now I want you to understand that as we look at this passage, and we'll look at the first

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.399
seven verses of Exodus chapter number 17, I want you to understand number one, the circumstances

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.079
that are provided.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.519
God provides us with some circumstances right away in verse number one, and as we look at

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:03.799
these circumstances, we find that it's interesting to know that the Bible tells us that the congregation

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:09.000
of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.920
Notice this next phrase right in the middle of verse number one, according to the commandment

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.000
of the Lord.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.079
I want you to understand that it was not Moses that just all of a sudden decided, we're going

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:23.600
to pick up camp and we're going to move.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.760
It was not that they were following the leadership of Moses exclusively.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.799
No, it was not the idea of some group of people, some group that came up with this

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:38.519
idea and this committee decided that we're going to move forward and we're going to go

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.679
over here and we're going to relocate.

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:49.239
No, the Bible tells us that they went according to the commandment of the Lord.

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:51.040
According to the commandment of the Lord.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.200
They were obedient.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.040
They were, as we mentioned in chapter number 14, that command of go forward, and now we

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.480
find that they're going and they're obeying, they're following the leadership of God, and

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.399
the Bible tells us at the end of verse number one that they went according to the commandment

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:13.359
of the Lord and pitched in Rephidim, and it says this, and there was no water for the

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.760
people to drink.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.480
Now this is a problem.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.839
The congregation of the children of Israel is a large congregation.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.239
It's not a small group of people, as I mentioned this morning.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:30.679
It's not just a handful of people that were crossing that Red Sea.

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:36.119
Really the estimates that are given are nearly two million people that would have crossed

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:40.000
over and that are being, of course, traveling at this point.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.080
You find that they come to a place and they pitch in this place, Rephidim, and there's

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.440
no water for the people to drink.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.679
Now let me ask you this question.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:51.679
Does God know that we need water?

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.880
He created us, right?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.520
God knows that we need water.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.880
He knows that it is a basic necessity for mankind, for human beings to survive.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.320
It is necessary that we have water.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.080
You can live longer without food than you can live without water.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.080
It is a scientific, medical-proven fact.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.000
We need water.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.039
In fact, there are times in which we understand, as we've lived and as we've experienced life

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:31.440
at certain levels and doing various activities, that there are times in which we can become

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.239
dehydrated.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.559
I'm not sure about you, but I know of me.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:41.919
If I'm doing something and I get to the place where I become dehydrated or even on the edge

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:46.880
of becoming dehydrated, I can feel that I need water.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.400
I love sweet tea.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.119
But there are times that I just need water.

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:55.039
God knows that we need water.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:59.880
And He created us, but we find that when we consider the circumstances here in verse number

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
eight,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880
And He created us, but we find that when we consider the circumstances here in verse

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:01.880


00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.180
and really get the backdrop to what's taking place,

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.680
that it is God that has led them here.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680
They're there in that place

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.880
according to the commandment of the Lord.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.480
Now I mentioned this morning,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.180
and I understand that there's this misconception

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.280
that many have that if we're obedient to God,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.780
if we live by faith,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.980
if we go forward as He's commanded us to do so,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.080
that we're not going to have any problems.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.880
That everything's just going to be perfect.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.280
Well, they're in this place

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.280
according to the commandment of the Lord,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.480
and there's no water.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.280
God knows that they need water.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.580
I want you to notice not only the circumstances,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.780
but notice number two,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.980
if you're taking notes,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.480
the complaint of the people.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.480
In verses 2 and 3, we read of the complaint,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.680
the murmuring of the people of Israel.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.280
It's one thing that they were consistently good at

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.180
was complaining.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.380
Not much has changed in thousands of years

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.780
of human history,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.280
for the reality is that it's very easy for us

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.080
as human beings to complain about our circumstances.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080
It's very easy for us to look at the negative aspect

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.680
of the circumstances in which we deal with,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.280
and thus I believe it's so often

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.480
throughout the Word of God

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.980
that we are given the instruction

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.380
to rejoice evermore,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.680
to be thankful,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.080
to give thanks in all things,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.880
because the reality is that

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.180
it is easy to complain.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.180
In verses 2 and 3,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.480
God records for us the complaint of the people.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.580
Notice in verse number 2, the Bible says,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.080
wherefore the people did chide with Moses.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.080
That word chide is an interesting word.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.080
It means to contend or to argue with.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.680
And look at what they said,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.880
give us water that we may drink.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.980
Can you imagine?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.480
Can you imagine being Moses

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.780
and having this large group of people

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.280
nearly two million in size,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.080
and you follow the direction of God,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.080
you're in the place where God has led you to be,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.780
and you're there and there's no water,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.880
and the people now come and they're contending,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.280
they're chiding with you,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.480
they're arguing with you,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.279
and they say, give us water that we may drink.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.580
And Moses said unto them,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.180
why chide ye with me?

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.480
Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.279
The people thirsted there for water.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:29.779
The Bible says in verse number 3,

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:34.480
and the people murmured against Moses.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.680
To murmur means to grumble or to complain.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.680
They're complaining about their circumstances.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.180
They said this at the end of verse number 3,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.680
wherefore is this,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.680
that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.880
to kill us and our children

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.480
and our cattle with thirst.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.680
Man, aren't they so negative?

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.279
Isn't it easy for us when we face adversity,

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.480
when we face obstacles,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.580
when we face these types of circumstances

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.380
to just become super negative?

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.080
Think about all that they had experienced.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.480
Think about all that they've witnessed

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.180
and they've seen the hand of God.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.680
Think about the message that I preached this morning

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.279
about the crossing of the Red Sea

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:22.580
and the miraculous power of God

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.279
that was displayed that these people saw firsthand.

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:31.880
Think about the time after crossing the Red Sea

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.480
or at the place of Marah

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.680
and there's bitter waters

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.980
and God heals the waters

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.580
and they're able to drink.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.680
And think about the manna that they had had

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.880
to eat for breakfast that day,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.980
to have as nourishment for that day.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.980
They'd seen God work.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.480
But they're thirsty.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.779
And they chide.

00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:59.080
And they murmur.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.580
They were disappointed with their circumstances.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.580
And I would say this,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.680
their prior experience had not built their faith.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.080
I wish I could read Exodus 17

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.580
and I understand that often as we look back,

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.779
even in our own lives,

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.580
but especially in the lives of others,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.880
that it's very easy for us to say,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.279
man, if they would have done this

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.580
or if they would have done that

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.080
and we can do that in our own lives

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.880
and we can look back at circumstances.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.880
They say that hindsight is 20-20

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.779
and obviously when we look back

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:34.880
and we say, man, if I would have just trusted here,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.880
if I would have had this perspective.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.679
But wouldn't it have been interesting

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:40.580
if we could read Exodus 17

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.880
and read of the people

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.179
how that they just kind of got together

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:45.980
and said, I wonder how God's going to work

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.880
in this situation.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.679
I mean, do you remember what God did

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:50.779
just a few days ago

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.279
when we crossed over the Red Sea?

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:54.080
Do you remember how God blessed

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.779
and how he worked and provided that water?

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:58.779
He healed those bitter waters.

00:14:58.779 --> 00:14:59.779
Do you remember that manna

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:00.779
that we've been enjoying?

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:02.580
I mean, what is God going to do?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.080
How is God going to work?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.480
We don't know what he's going to do,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.080
but we know that there's no water

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.779
and we know that God made us.

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:10.880
He formed us.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.380
He knows what our needs are.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.080
He knows that we need water.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.380
And how is God going to provide?

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.080
What is God going to do

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.179
and have some measure of excitement

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:22.679
and anticipation and expectation

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.380
of seeing God work?

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.779
Unfortunately, we don't read it that way.

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:33.480
We read it just as I read it a few moments ago.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.980
They chide.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.679
They murmur.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:39.580
They grumble and they complain.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.580
Why have you brought us out of Egypt?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.179
Why have you done this?

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.980
And I can almost see Moses

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.779
as he's receiving the chiding

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:51.779
and the murmuring as the people

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:54.080
are angered and disappointed

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.980
and they're thirsty,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.679
that Moses is almost beside himself.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:02.580
I mean, it's God that brought us here.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.080
Did you not see the pillar?

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080
Right?

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.679
Can you imagine?

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:11.279
I mean, this pillar of cloud by day,

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.679
this pillar of fire by night,

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:13.980
I mean, when it moves, we move.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.080
When it stops, we stop.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.880
Right?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.779
And here, the people,

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:27.779
I believe that it's so representative

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:32.480
of human nature throughout human history.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.480
It's easy for us to criticize the children of Israel.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.480
It's easy for us to critique their lack of faith

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.080
and their lack of expectation,

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:45.179
their lack of trusting God.

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:48.380
It's easy for us to criticize and to critique.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.580
It's easy for us to say if they would have

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.179
and why didn't they?

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.779
But the reality is that if we would

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:57.480
just evaluate our lives

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.380
with the same level of standard

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.679
that we evaluate the children of Israel,

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:06.179
we'd find that we too fall short.

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:09.179
We too fail to trust God when we should.

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:11.580
We too murmur and complain

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.480
and get disappointed with our circumstances

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.380
and fail to have our faith increased

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.480
by prior experiences.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.980
The circumstances, the complaint,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.580
notice as we continue through the passage of Scripture

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.080
in verse number 4, number 3,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.480
if you're taking notes,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.480
I want you to note the cry of Moses.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.279
I love the response of Moses here

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:38.380
in verse number 4, by the way.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.880
And what a proper response this is.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.679
The Bible says,

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:45.580
"...and Moses cried unto the Lord,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.880
saying, What shall I do unto this people?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.480
They be almost ready to stone Me."

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.880
These people are upset. They're angry.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.380
They're ready to kill Moses

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.679
because of their circumstances.

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:05.980
And we read the cry of Moses.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.580
We read where the Bible says

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.580
that Moses cried unto the Lord.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.179
What a great response

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:14.080
when the people are chiding with him,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.580
when the people are murmuring against him,

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.880
that Moses goes to God.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.779
Moses understood that it was God

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:22.580
that had provided the direction.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.779
Moses understood that he was simply

00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:28.080
following the leadership that God had provided.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.080
Moses understood that God had taken care of them

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.080
and God had provided for them

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.580
and God had worked miraculously.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.780
And there were some things

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.179
that Moses had learned about God

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.179
and what he was capable of doing.

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:44.080
And so the response of Moses is here

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.280
in verse 4.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.679
It's the cry of Moses.

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:52.679
We understand that he's the human leader

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:53.979
of the children of Israel

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:55.380
at this particular time.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.280
And what a great lesson for leadership

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.580
and the dependence of the leader,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.780
the spiritual leader,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.280
the dependence upon God.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.580
We speak about leadership

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.380
and we think about spiritual leadership.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.580
I do not believe that it would be inappropriate

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.679
for us to make application this evening

00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.679
not only as we would think about

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:15.880
the leadership of Moses

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.080
with the children of Israel,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.080
but perhaps as we'd look at the leadership

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.280
of a pastor in a church family

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.280
and God has given a certain responsibility

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.280
to the pastor as the under-shepherd

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.880
and to provide leadership and direction

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.979
as I seek to follow God

00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:33.479
and to provide that vision and that leadership

00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:37.280
and how desperately I need God.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.580
But let's take it a step further

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.479
and think about the families

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.179
because the reality is that a church,

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:44.179
a strong church,

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:46.780
is made up of strong families.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.580
And God has given the responsibility

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.880
to the husband to be the leader of the home.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.580
And as we think about the leadership

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.179
that God desires for men

00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:00.080
to provide in the home,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.880
we find that it's absolutely...

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:08.840
essential that men would be dependent upon God, and that we'd understand that we have

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:15.680
to follow God as we lead our families, that we'd understand that this is a difficulty

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.360
and that there are challenges and there are obstacles, and I need the leadership and the

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.960
direction that God would provide, and oh, that we'd cry out unto the Lord.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.480
I love the cry of Moses. I believe that his response to the events that are taking place

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.840
are exemplary. I believe that they're appropriate. I love that he seeks God and he says, what

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:51.240
shall I do unto this people? What should I do? I love the fact that Moses cries out unto

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:59.440
the Lord because it's then that we receive the response that God provides. How often

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:09.120
do we fail to get instruction from God because we simply don't ask Him? How often do we falter

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.640
and fail and flounder around because we don't have wisdom that we need, but yet God said

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.920
if any lack wisdom, let them ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.320
not, and yet there are times in our lives where we simply fail to ask and therefore

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:36.720
we don't receive. You have not because you ask not. God wants to provide direction for

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.640
our lives. He wants to give answers. He wants to provide leadership, and we find that the

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.760
truth of verse number 4 is so impactful in our lives because he's crying unto the Lord

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:56.040
and we see the cry, but we find the great impact that this response of Moses has because

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.280
it's then that we come to verse number 5 and the Bible says that the Lord said unto

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:08.880
Moses. We see number 4, if you're taking notes, if you're taking notes number 4 this evening,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:17.919
the command of the Lord. The command. I want you to notice that verse number 5 is the result

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:25.800
of verse number 4. The command is the result of the cry. Because Moses cries out unto the

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.360
Lord, because Moses says what shall I do unto this people, Moses is acknowledging his lack

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.320
of understanding with what to do and how to operate and how to function. He's acknowledging

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.160
to God that I need you, I need your wisdom, I need your direction and we find that God

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.960
responds and how thankful we are this evening that our God hears and answers prayer. That

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.760
we can cry unto Him and we can have confidence that He hears us and we can have confidence

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.440
that He answers and the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses. Notice the command in

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.680
verse 5 as we would think about the response and God giving Moses the direction. The Bible

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:20.120
says go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:28.960
thou smotest the river, take in thine hand and go. As I read verse number 5 I recognize

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.440
some specific aspects of what God tells Moses to do. He tells Moses to go on before the

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:42.639
people. He tells him, however, to take with thee of the elders of Israel. And so Moses

00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:47.520
was not to go by himself, there to be some people with him, some of the elders of Israel

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.639
and you find that he tells them, God says, you know, take these elders but also that

00:23:52.639 --> 00:24:02.120
rod, the rod that you smote the river with, take that in thine hand and go. Go where?

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:08.120
Notice verse 6, the command continues, he says this, behold, God speaking, the Lord

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:17.440
speaking to Moses, he says, behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:29.399
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink.

00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:35.000
This is not an unfamiliar passage of Scripture. We are familiar with the account. We know

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.679
what takes place, many of us. God says, go on before the people, take the elders of Israel

00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:51.600
with you, take your rod with you, I'm going to go before you and I'm going to stand on

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.440
a rock in Horeb and with that rod you should smite the rock and out of that rock will come

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:07.880
water that the people would drink. Can you imagine? The command, the instruction, the

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:17.720
direction, Moses says, Lord, what do I do? The people are ready to stone me. God knows

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.119
that the people need water. The people are very disappointed with their circumstances.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:29.160
They've complained and they've murmured, they've chided with Moses and they feel like again,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.360
they're going to die. You brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:41.279
cattle with thirst. This was the purpose of our journey. This is why we left. And Moses says,

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:48.320
God, I don't know what to do. And God says, here's what to do. And He gives them a command.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.800
Now, we stopped right in the middle of verse number 6 and we'll finish it up here in just a

00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:01.200
moment. But I want you to think about the situation. And if you can, just for a moment,

00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:11.279
put yourself in the shoes of Moses. I've sought to explain the passage as best I can so that in

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:15.640
our sanctified imaginations, we can be there and we can see the circumstances and we can

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:22.760
understand what's taking place. And Moses to go on before the people and take the elders and his

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.640
rod. And God's going to go to a rock in Horeb and he's going to smite that rock and there's

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:35.119
going to be water that comes out. And I want you to think just for a moment of these circumstances

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:43.399
and I want you to think about the command of God. And I want you to think about the message

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:51.279
that I preached this morning of go forward. And there are times, as I mentioned this morning,

00:26:51.279 --> 00:27:00.959
in our third point, what hinders us from going forward. See, Moses had been given some direction

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:12.760
of God to go on before the people. And Moses would have to go how? By faith. He'd have to go why?

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:19.279
Out of obedience, right? It's God that told him. It wasn't Moses that just came up with this idea

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.239
that I'm going to go smite some rock and water's going to come out of it. No, why did he go do what he did?

00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:34.640
He went because he was obeying God. How did he go? He had to go in faith. I don't believe,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:41.640
I don't know of any other record prior to this where a rod had smitten a rock and water

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:51.720
came out of it to take care of the thirst of nearly two million people. God didn't say,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.559
Moses, I'm going to take you to another body of water and just as I healed waters back

00:27:57.559 --> 00:28:03.800
in Marah, I'll heal those waters so you can drink them. God didn't tell him that. And

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.080
I want you to just put yourself in the shoes of Moses just for a moment. And I want you

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:22.440
to ask yourself the question, would you go? Would you go? Would you be obedient to God

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.380
to go on before the people with the elders with the rod to the rock where God would stand

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:33.640
and smite that rock and water come out? Would you go? Would you obey? Would you have the

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:40.919
faith to trust that God would do what God said He would do? Because every time God gives

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:51.760
a command, there's a decision that has to be made. A decision has to be made. We can

00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:01.359
obey the command or we can disobey the command. Right? Any command. We find that there are

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:08.000
consequences of our decision. The decision to obey leads typically to blessing as we

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.679
read in Deuteronomy 11. The decision to disobey leads to cursing again as we read in Deuteronomy

00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:21.840
11. We see it in our own lives and in parenting with children, we tell Johnny or Susie to

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.039
do such and such and we give them instruction and direction and they say, I'm not going

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:35.720
to do it. Really? Let me help you make a better decision. But when we think about this

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:44.239
situation with Moses, the command has been given. Moses, go on before the people. Take

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:52.000
the elders. Take your rod. I'm going to go before you. I'll stand before thee there upon

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.760
the rock in Horeb and Moses, you should smite the rock and water will come out that the

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.679
people may drink. What's Moses going to do? We know what he does.

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:07.199
recorded history, and it's an event that took place thousands of years ago.

00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:11.439
But I wonder if just for a moment this evening we can put ourselves

00:30:11.439 --> 00:30:14.959
into the account.

00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:17.759
Or maybe we just put ourselves into some

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:21.919
daily obedience to God.

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:25.039
When God gives us direction, and

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:29.919
even as we mentioned this morning about the marching orders for the church, that

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:35.279
His last command before His ascension continues to be

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:38.639
the mission of the church.

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:44.559
When God, through His Spirit, prompts us to talk to that person, to give that

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:49.359
person a gospel tract, to be that witness,

00:30:50.479 --> 00:30:55.119
how do we respond? What do we do?

00:30:55.519 --> 00:31:01.759
As we look at the command of the Lord in verses 5 and part of verse number 6,

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:08.799
we must pause and consider how it is that we too would respond.

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:12.559
What if we were in that situation? What if I were Moses? What if you were

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.039
Moses?

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:22.799
As we conclude this evening and finish up verse 6 and look at verse 7,

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:27.519
number 5, if you're taking notes, I want you to see the confidence of Moses.

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:31.519
I want you to see the confidence of Moses.

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:39.439
The last phrase of verse number 6 is so impactful to me, it's convicting to me.

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:46.399
Such a great testimony for this man Moses.

00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:55.279
The Bible simply says this, and Moses did so in the sight of the elders

00:31:55.279 --> 00:32:03.279
of Israel. He did so. He obeyed. I believe that he obeyed

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:08.479
because his confidence and thus the point, the confidence of Moses,

00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:14.239
he was confident, he had faith that God would do what God said He would do.

00:32:14.239 --> 00:32:20.479
He believed that God would give that water, that as he went on before the

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:24.159
people and he took the elders and they said, where are we going? And I don't

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:28.079
know that they said that, but just for a moment, if we could put

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:32.559
ourselves within the account and understand the circumstances. And

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:36.239
he goes, Moses, what are you doing? Moses, why are we going? Moses, what are you

00:32:36.239 --> 00:32:39.199
doing? And Moses says, I believe God, this is

00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:43.119
how He's going to provide. And he goes to that rock and he smites the

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:48.399
rock. Can you imagine when the water gushed

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:53.679
out? It simply says, and Moses

00:32:53.679 --> 00:33:00.959
did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:05.039
I'm challenged by the fact that it says that he did so in the sight of the

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:08.079
elders of Israel. We understand that that's at the command

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:12.319
of God, according to verse number five, but no doubt there are times in which

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:16.479
perhaps we would say, well, let me just do this kind of in

00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:22.239
privacy in case maybe it doesn't work out right, that way I'm not embarrassed.

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:28.000
No, no, Moses had confidence. Moses just simply believed that God would do what

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.519
God said He would do. And here the Bible tells us in verse

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:36.559
number seven, and he called the name of the place

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:40.639
Massa and Meribah because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because

00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:46.319
they tempted the Lord, saying, is the Lord among us or not? And we find

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:51.039
that here in verse number six, when he did what God told him to do, that the

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:56.319
Bible tells us that God would provide water.

00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:59.439
He said, when you smite the rock, that there shall come water

00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:04.399
out of it that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:12.239
of Israel. God provided miraculously the

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.599
confidence of Moses.

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:21.679
Moses had never witnessed this specific miracle

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:25.600
to the best of our knowledge as we study Scripture.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.440
He had seen God part waters. He had seen God

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:36.559
heal waters. To the best of our knowledge, he had never seen God provide water out

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:39.119
of a rock.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.559
But he believed God. He had confidence in God.

00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:48.320
He had witnessed the hand of God. He had observed

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:55.199
the moving of God many times in his life, and therefore he believed that God

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:59.359
could do it. I believe that he's fully confident. He's

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:04.959
fully persuaded that God is able. And this evening,

00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:09.440
as we think about our own lives, as we think about the

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:16.239
the truth of living in this time, in this place, we think about the

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:20.239
obstacles and the difficulties in which we face.

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:25.359
How is it that we deal with those obstacles and those difficulties?

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:29.440
Are we in the place of God? Are we doing what God's commanded us to do?

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.160
Are we following the direction of God? And if we are, we understand that there

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.359
are times that we'll face obstacles. But

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:42.160
remember, those obstacles are not designed to detour us or to derail us.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.880
Those obstacles are designed to grow us and

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.479
to develop us. And we find that there are times in which we

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:53.039
are following the Lord exactly as he's given us the direction,

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:57.759
exactly as he's provided us the command, and we're doing exactly what God wants

00:35:57.759 --> 00:36:03.119
us to do. And there are obstacles.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:07.679
We're going forward, but there are challenges.

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:12.559
There's opposition. The obstacles are there.

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:19.440
The hindrances are there. But we've made that determination. We are resolved

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.880
that we will go forward at the command of the Lord.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.799
And that we will have confidence in our God that he is able, that we are

00:36:28.799 --> 00:36:31.279
obeying him and we are taking him at his word.

00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:36.320
We are living by faith. That's what faith is, just believing God.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.720
Believing that God will do what God said he would do.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:47.440
And I find that as we live in this time, in this era, in our own lives,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.199
as we think about the circumstances of the children of Israel as they're

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:53.759
described to us here in this passage of scripture,

00:36:53.759 --> 00:36:57.679
and as we would examine and deal with our own lives, we could respond the way

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:00.639
that the children of Israel do. And we could just sit around and complain and

00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:05.600
murmur and chide with, and be disappointed with, and give all

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.639
sorts of reasons and explanations as to why we can't,

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:12.720
why we shouldn't, and so on and so forth.

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:16.559
I'm thankful that Moses cried out unto the Lord.

00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:22.239
And I'm thankful that God answered. Oh, that we'd seek the face of God.

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:27.839
God, how do we navigate these times? We're living in days of difficulty and

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:33.039
days of obstacles and challenges, and we can't quite do the things that we

00:37:33.039 --> 00:37:36.479
used to do. We have these obstacles, and God, how do

00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:39.440
we go forward? How do we reach people? How do we

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.359
interact with people? We're to reach a lost and dying world, and we

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:49.359
understand that we have been given the glorious message of the

00:37:49.359 --> 00:37:52.559
gospel, the greatest message that could ever be given,

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:55.839
and we've been entrusted with that message.

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:59.119
And it's not that we would hold it and keep it to ourselves, but that we'd give

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:04.880
it to a lost and dying world. We say, but there are obstacles. I know

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.759
that you go out just as I go out, and people are less

00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:11.359
interested in talking than they ever have been.

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:15.919
People are fearful. They want to back away. They don't get too close, and so on

00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:20.000
and so forth. We've got to reach them. We've got to

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.479
reach them. We've got to go forward, and we've got to

00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:29.679
pray and ask God, God, what do we do? How do we

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:36.880
reach a community, a city, a country,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:43.359
a world with the gospel of Jesus Christ? How do we do it?

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:47.919
Remember as we read this morning in Matthew 28,

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:51.839
he said, all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:57.760
Go ye therefore. And as we read the command of the commission to preach the

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.760
gospel, to baptize, and to disciple, he says this, and lo

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:09.359
I am with thee always. I'm so thankful that he promises to

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:16.399
be with us, to give us the strength, the wisdom,

00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:22.719
the direction that we need. And because Moses cried out unto the Lord,

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:27.119
God gave him the answer. Here you go, Moses.

00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:30.799
Here's how we're going to provide water for all these people. Here's how I'm

00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:33.919
going to provide water for all these people.

00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:38.960
And Moses, I'm going to use you. Go over here,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:46.799
do this, and I'll do this. And Moses went, and God did.

00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:52.719
Isn't that exciting? This evening they pitched in Rephidim.

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:56.320
They went at the commandment of the Lord. They obeyed God.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.200
They were not in the wrong place. They were where they were supposed to be.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.760
There was no water.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.400
God said, through this obstacle,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.680
I'm going to prove my power again

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.880
to once again seek to develop you,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.840
to grow you through this time of difficulty.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.280
I don't know what obstacle you face personally.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.720
I don't know what difficulty you're facing,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.840
but I know that God is able.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.160
And I know that God continues to work in this manner,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.160
for often we find even in the New Testament,

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.760
the last Sunday school lesson that we had a couple of weeks ago,

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.960
Jesus tells the disciples to go on the ship and go to the other side.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:49.200
It was there that they faced a terrible storm.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:55.440
It was there that they got to see the power of God.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.240
What manner of man is this?

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.080
Even the winds and the waves obey.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.440
He's God.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.640
He's God.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.880
And He wants to work in and through us.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.240
There never would have been water that came from the rock

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.560
if Moses had not cried out unto the Lord,

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.720
and if Moses had not obeyed the Lord.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.120
I'm thankful that Moses, he cried out,

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.320
and then I'm thankful that he obeyed.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.800
Because we get to read an account such as this and rejoice.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.160
Man, this is wonderful.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.520
Look at what God did.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.440
But how do we apply it in our lives?

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.360
Oh, that we trust God, and that we'd follow Him,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.120
and that we'd see Him work mightily.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.080
Father, we love You.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.280
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.320
As we look at this passage of Scripture this evening,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:42:01.760
we're encouraged to be reminded of Your power.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:09.520
God, we're challenged as we review and examine our own lives

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.160
to consider the level of obedience that we have,

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.720
the level of faith that we have

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.080
in trusting You and following You.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:24.000
We pray, God, that You'd help us to go forward.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.400
That's the first sign of trouble,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.000
that we would not retreat,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.360
that we would not chide and murmur.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.680
God, that we'd trust You.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.200
With great levels of anticipation and expectation,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.560
we would long to see You work.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:55.440
To see what and how You will do what only You can do.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.000
Would You help us to go forward?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.240
Because You've commanded us to,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.720
it's a matter of obedience.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.440
Help us to go forward in faith.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.920
Help us to see You work as only You can.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.200
We pray that in these few moments of invitation

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.520
that You'd have Your will in way,

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.280
that Your Spirit would move in the hearts

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.080
of those that are gathered locally

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.560
and those that have tuned in on this service tonight.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.520
That, God, we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.040
Well, thank You for the work that You'll do.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.040
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
