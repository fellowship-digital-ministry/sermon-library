1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hebrews chapter number two, last week we started this lesson, we ought to listen up.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,000
We've been dealing with this subject matter here on Wednesday evenings, doing what we

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,319
ought to do, and just because we know what we ought to do doesn't mean we do what we

4
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,760
ought to do.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,559
And last week we started with this thought of we ought to listen up, and I knew, and

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,600
I said from the start that I wasn't confident that we'd get through all of the material

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,920
last week, and we certainly did not.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,920
And so tonight's kind of part two of that same lesson.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to very quickly give an overview of what we looked at last week in case you

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,540
were not here, and then we'll get into the follow-up this evening.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,020
But we look at Hebrews chapter two and verse number one, the Bible says, therefore we ought

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,240
to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,360
let them slip.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,639
For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received,

15
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:59,639
a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

16
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:03,400
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,639
heard Him, God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers

18
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:13,319
miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will.

19
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,900
And we focus on that first statement of the verse, number one, therefore we ought to give

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,239
the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard.

21
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,879
He says this, lest at any time we should let them slip, and we spoke about this idea

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,160
of giving the more earnest heed, that's why I've titled it We Ought to Listen Up, and

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,559
we said that we see that, therefore, to begin verse number one of chapter two, and we need

24
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,800
to determine why is it there?

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,360
What is it that was given to us in chapter one that is so important that he concludes,

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,919
he reaches this conclusion that we ought to pay attention, we ought to give the more earnest

27
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,879
heed, and so we went back to chapter one last week, we talked about the fact that the book

28
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,120
of Hebrews deals with the subject matter throughout the book, a theme, that Christ is better,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,319
He is superior, in chapter one He deals with being superior to the angels, but we find

30
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,279
that the book begins in verse number one that says, God, who at sundry times and in divers

31
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:17,759
manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, but, notice verse number

32
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:25,919
two, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir

33
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,759
of all things, by whom also He made the worlds, who being the brightness of His glory, and

34
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,880
the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,919
He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.

36
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,919
Now if those three verses don't make you want to shout and rejoice, I'm not sure what will,

37
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:50,240
and the reality is that we serve a great God, we have a wonderful Savior, He is worthy

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,440
of our worship and of our praise, and God reveals here that yes, He spoke, and we understand

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,199
all scriptures given by inspiration of God, and is profitable, and just because if you

40
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,800
have in your Bible, some people have a red letter edition Bible, listen, the red letters

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,839
aren't more inspired than the other words, because all scripture is given by inspiration

42
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:17,199
of God, but it is something when God in flesh came to earth, and He walked among them, and

43
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:24,759
He spoke, remember I said this, that those that heard Him often would say, no man spake

44
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,360
like this man.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,240
He speaks with power and with authority, and that's because He's God, He is God in flesh,

46
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,320
and we find that the multitudes would come to hear Him, they would hear as they did in

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,720
Mark chapter number two, that it was noise, that He was in the city, and all people, they

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,279
wanted to go and hear Him, and they came, and they surrounded the house, there was no

49
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:53,080
room for anyone to enter in, because there was such a great group of people, and you

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,320
find throughout His earthly ministry, there were many that wanted to hear Him, and He

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,199
spoke with authority.

52
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,679
I'm thankful this evening that we have the scriptures, that we have the word of God,

53
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:07,919
and we found last week that we said this, that we need to recognize the danger, the

54
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,919
danger of what?

55
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,960
Well, the danger of not hearing, the danger of not giving the more earnest heed, as the

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,200
scriptures say here, the danger of not listening up, the danger of neglecting personal Bible

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,399
reading, of missing church services, of not hearing the truth that God wants us to hear.

58
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,519
We said this, the word hear and understanding of giving a, to that which we have heard and

59
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,279
that idea of hearing is not just to hear, but to hear with the purpose of doing, with

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,359
the intent of obeying.

61
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:49,739
It's similar to what Samuel was told to say from Eli, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

62
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:55,640
And the idea was that he was listening, hearing, with the intent of obeying.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,660
I'm going to obey, I'm going to apply, I'm going to take heed to what you have said.

64
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,660
And so we deal with, and we looked at a number of passages of scripture last week, dealing

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,720
with the fact that God has been faithful.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,339
God has been faithful to give his word.

67
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:17,760
We study the Old Testament, we read multiple times how that God sent prophets and God gave

68
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,260
his word, but the people would not hear.

69
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,940
Can I tell you this evening that God has been faithful to preserve this book?

70
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,019
I am so thankful that God has preserved the Bible, that we can have in our hands today,

71
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,859
tonight a, the copy of God's precious word.

72
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:43,700
The truth of inspiration is so important for us to understand and it's so foundational

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,940
that we understand that scripture, all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

74
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,339
It's God breathed, but I want you to know this evening that inspiration without preservation

75
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,940
doesn't really help any of us today.

76
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,739
Because the originals are no longer with us, but God promised that he would preserve his

77
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,739
word.

78
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:10,299
And can I tell you that God always does what he says he will do and God has providentially

79
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:16,820
preserved his word and we have this evening the word, we have the scriptures and what

80
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
a blessing.

81
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,100
I think about Paul, even as he would write to Timothy and he says that from a child thou

82
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,579
hast heard the holy scriptures, thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able

83
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,700
to make thee wise unto salvation.

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,459
No, Timothy didn't have the originals, but Timothy had the copies of the copies of the

85
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,459
copies that were from the originals.

86
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,820
And Paul said that that was scripture, that was God's word.

87
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,179
He says to those as he's concluding that he's writing and giving some instruction, he says,

88
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,459
bring these things to me, but especially the parchments.

89
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,459
Why?

90
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,779
Because he wanted to have those scriptures and I'm so thankful this evening.

91
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,260
And so if we understand the danger, if we recognize, acknowledge the danger and we're

92
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,940
dealing with the subject matter of we ought to listen up, then I believe, and what we'll

93
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,619
focus on studying this evening is how do we learn to listen?

94
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:16,579
How do we develop a plan for hearing, for listening, for the voice of God?

95
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:20,579
I made a statement a couple of weeks ago on Sunday evening as I preached about Elijah

96
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,859
that he heard the voice of the Lord.

97
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:29,739
We need to get in a place where we hear the voice of the Lord, that we understand that

98
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:36,100
as we open the precious pages of this book, that God is speaking to me as an individual,

99
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,899
that God loves me, that God has a message for me and I approach it that way.

100
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:47,619
And so how do we come to this place that we are going to, as we read here, we ought to

101
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:52,459
give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, less than any time we

102
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,100
should let them slip.

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,459
Is it just going to be this, I'm going to work harder?

104
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,859
No, I believe that we need to develop a plan.

105
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,899
And I'm going to share a few things with you this evening that I hope would be a help for

106
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,899
you.

107
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,899
And the first thought is this, it's four simple thoughts, this is not an exhaustive plan for

108
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:15,579
how we can develop this plan of learning to listen, but the first thought this evening

109
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,739
is that we must remember the authority of God's word.

110
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,579
We must remember the authority of God's word.

111
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:26,619
I want you to think about this, what we believe about the Bible, what we believe about the

112
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:32,380
book that you're holding in your hands this evening, will impact how you approach it.

113
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,460
If you just, listen, people have the idea, you can read articles online, you can listen

114
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:45,059
to people that will stand up and they'll speak for many, many lengths of time and hours and

115
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,700
they'll say this is not the word of God, this is just man's words about God.

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,739
Can I tell you this evening, if this is just man's words about God, it's really not that

117
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:59,500
helpful because you can have your opinion about God and I can have my opinion about

118
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,820
God and so on and so forth, but I'm thankful this evening that God said that he was going

119
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,460
to give the word and that all scripture is given by inspiration of God, that he providentially

120
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,219
preserved it, and it is God's word, and it's not man just writing about what they think

121
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:21,440
about God, it is God who is the creator of the universe telling us who he is.

122
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,119
And that's awesome.

123
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:28,940
And when we understand that this word, this Bible, that it's profitable, when we understand

124
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,020
that it's going to produce fruit, that it's going to be effective, it works in us.

125
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,219
Listen, I know this evening, you're here on a Wednesday evening at church, you've read

126
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:46,340
the Bible, you know that God's word is effectual, that it works in your heart, the entrance

127
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:54,340
of thy words giveth light, and what a joy to know the truth of this book, and we must

128
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,500
remember the authority.

129
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,020
Somebody has, and I think it's a lot of people.

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,220
over the years that have used this reference.

131
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,060
But the fact of the matter is that there are some

132
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,700
that have referred to the Bible

133
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,420
as being God's love letter to mankind.

134
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,740
And I think that's okay to refer to it that way.

135
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,340
I don't have a problem with that.

136
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,820
And the reality is that when they use that analogy,

137
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,780
they try to remind those that they're speaking to

138
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,460
of receiving a letter from a loved one.

139
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,300
Now, I know that today, the idea of letter writing

140
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,340
is kind of not as popular as it once was

141
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,140
because we have so many other means of communication.

142
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,500
But I want you to know that,

143
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,140
and most of us here this evening,

144
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,660
we remember when writing a letter

145
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,340
and dropping it in the box was the only way

146
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,260
to communicate with people on a regular basis.

147
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,140
I mean, it used to be that they charged you

148
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,220
by the minute to make phone calls.

149
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,140
You remember that.

150
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,420
You're old enough, just as I am,

151
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,260
to remember when you had to pay per minute

152
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,540
to make those phone calls.

153
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,140
And so you could drop those letters in the mail.

154
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,340
I remember while we're in college,

155
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,660
my kids, they crack me up.

156
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,020
They say, well, how old were you when you got a cell phone?

157
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,660
Much older than you are.

158
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,580
And by the way, I paid for it when I got it, amen?

159
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,660
And the reality is that we didn't have cell phones.

160
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,420
And so I'd go into the little mail room

161
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,660
where we went to college,

162
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,260
and I'd always go in to look at that box

163
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,100
to see if there was,

164
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,500
I didn't care if there was a graded report in there,

165
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,740
if there was some note from the dean in there.

166
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,940
No, I was looking for a note from Holly.

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,380
And if she had a note put in there,

168
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,620
and it was in there, guess what I did with that note?

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,020
I just set it aside and ignored it.

170
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,860
No, I read it.

171
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,660
And guess how many times I read it?

172
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,020
Multiple.

173
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,660
I didn't just read it one time.

174
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,820
Sometimes you try to read between the lines.

175
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,380
You know what I'm saying?

176
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,420
You try to figure out,

177
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,180
I wonder what she really means by that.

178
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,980
I wonder, and so on and so forth.

179
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
And you can understand, listen,

180
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,700
this book is from the God of the universe,

181
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,900
from our God, who loves us with an everlasting love,

182
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,780
who wants to communicate with us,

183
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,620
and he's given it to us.

184
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,380
And when I remember what this book is,

185
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,660
when I remember that this book is like no other book,

186
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,780
I have books all over my house,

187
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,180
I got books in my library,

188
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
I got books on my desk,

189
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,980
I got them in my drawer on my desk,

190
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,460
I got books all over the place,

191
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,060
but there's no book that I enjoy reading

192
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,220
as much as I enjoy reading this book.

193
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,100
There's no other book.

194
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,220
Listen, if I'm only gonna have time to read one book a day,

195
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,300
it's gonna be this one.

196
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,980
It's not going to be something else.

197
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,060
It's not gonna be some news or some whatever periodical.

198
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,060
No, this book is from by God to me as his child.

199
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,700
And I believe that when we come with that approach,

200
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,420
it's going to really help us to learn, to listen,

201
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,860
to have that ear to hear what God has for me.

202
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,700
Why?

203
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,100
Because God's speaking to me.

204
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,060
I understand that as we study the scriptures,

205
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,420
it's important to have proper hermeneutics

206
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,300
and to interpret the scriptures properly

207
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,980
and to understand who the letter or the book was written to

208
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,880
in the time and so on and so forth.

209
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,620
But this book is a divine book.

210
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,980
This book carries with it not only a message

211
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,580
to the original hearers,

212
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,340
but it carries with it a message to me

213
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,420
as God's child today.

214
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,620
And that's amazing.

215
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,460
And so we come from that position.

216
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,140
When I come from that position,

217
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,000
it leads me to my second thought this evening,

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,380
that I must then desire to hear from God.

219
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,340
Let me say this, not only desiring,

220
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,540
but expecting to hear from God.

221
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,380
I think about this.

222
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,760
I have had the opportunity in recent days

223
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,960
to be at conferences and hear folks preach.

224
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,980
I don't hear a ton of preaching

225
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,100
because I often am preaching,

226
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,680
but I do listen to some preaching.

227
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,500
I have opportunity to go to some conferences.

228
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,060
Of course, Sunday night, Brother Damastus preached.

229
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,900
And man, when I come to church,

230
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm expecting to hear from God.

231
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,420
When I open my Bible to read each morning,

232
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm expecting, I'm desiring to hear something from God.

233
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,840
If I don't have that desire,

234
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,100
if I don't have that expectation,

235
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,780
then I'm not really probably gonna hear from God.

236
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm not going to, it's just gonna be,

237
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,500
yep, check the box, I got it done, I made it through.

238
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,980
But I want you to think about this.

239
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,340
Psalm 119 and verse 18,

240
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,700
we're familiar with the verse of Scripture.

241
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,860
The Bible says that the psalmist cries out,

242
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,500
"'Open thou mine eyes,

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,340
"'that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.'"

244
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,460
You know how often it is?

245
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,500
Listen, I don't know how many times

246
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,540
I've read the Bible through,

247
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,740
and I don't say that for any prideful type of reason.

248
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,260
I just really don't know.

249
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,380
I read the Bible through multiple times a year.

250
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,460
I've preached through,

251
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,980
I have, as the pastor of Fellowship Adventist Church

252
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,580
for 13, a little over 13 years,

253
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,520
I've preached through like 29 books of the Bible, all right?

254
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,380
That's how many books I have preached through,

255
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,020
verse by verse, chapter by chapter,

256
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,520
but I still read it every day.

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,520
You know what I find?

258
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,460
There are times, Kevin,

259
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,780
that I read a portion of Scripture

260
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,940
that I just got done preaching,

261
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,560
and God shows me something that I never saw

262
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,120
the first time that I read it,

263
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,620
or the 50th time that I read it,

264
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,980
or even when I preached it

265
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,140
and studied to preach that message.

266
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,580
This book is awesome.

267
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,680
And I come to it expecting, desiring to hear from God.

268
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,900
I think about that verse that I quoted in Psalm 118.

269
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,320
I think about the reference to Samuel

270
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,900
by way of introduction this evening

271
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,340
when he said, "'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'"

272
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,700
And those are two prayers that I pray each day

273
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,500
when I open up my Bible and I begin to read.

274
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,940
I pray those two thoughts from Scripture,

275
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,900
Psalm 119 and verse 18, and 1 Samuel 3 and verse 10,

276
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,300
because I wanna hear from God.

277
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,780
I wanna hear from God.

278
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,660
Turn over if you go to Psalm 42,

279
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,840
and I want you to see the imagery that God gives us.

280
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,700
It's a text that no doubt you're familiar with,

281
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,860
but I want you to see it this evening.

282
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,340
In Psalm 42, verses one and two,

283
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,460
the Bible says,

284
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,860
as the heart panteth after the water brooks,

285
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,860
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

286
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,100
Notice it says, my soul thirsteth for God,

287
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,900
for the living God.

288
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,300
When shall I come and appear before God?

289
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,660
I wonder if your soul's ever thirsted for God.

290
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,740
You need to hear from God.

291
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
You need a message from the Lord.

292
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,460
You're longing to have that communication from God,

293
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,500
and you go to his word and you receive it.

294
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,140
Listen, I've read accounts of individuals

295
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,220
that have not had the privilege

296
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,660
of having a Bible like you and like me.

297
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,100
They've been outlawed.

298
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,180
There are people that were killed, martyred,

299
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,860
burned at the stake simply for having a copy of the Bible.

300
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,060
There are people that were Christians

301
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,220
living under communist rule,

302
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,860
that the communist, even,

303
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,060
I mean, I'm talking just 100 years ago.

304
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm not talking 400 years ago.

305
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,300
In portions of Europe,

306
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,340
you find that just 100 years ago,

307
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,820
somebody found with a Bible

308
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,620
how they would face great persecution,

309
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,380
be imprisoned.

310
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,980
I remember reading a story once

311
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,620
of a young girl that did not have a Bible,

312
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,860
but she attended a church where they preached the Bible,

313
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,260
and she so desperately wanted to have a Bible of her own

314
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,340
that she'd have the opportunity to read it,

315
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,380
to not just have to only be able to hear it

316
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,740
when she would go to church,

317
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,500
but that she'd be able to read it every day of her life,

318
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,340
and she enjoyed the opportunity to go to church

319
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,380
and to hear the preaching,

320
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,140
but man, she just longed to be able to read it every day,

321
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,220
and she asked the preacher if she could have the Bible

322
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,300
and she would take it each evening

323
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,940
and bring it back each morning,

324
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,300
and he didn't know exactly what she was doing.

325
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,180
He thought maybe that she was just reading

326
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,020
as much as she possibly could,

327
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,780
and she came back, and after a period of time,

328
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,820
he began to inquire.

329
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
She said, no, I'm not reading it

330
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,140
because if I just read it,

331
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,380
then I would just read it once and I'm done.

332
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,140
I am writing it down word for word

333
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,460
so that I can have my own copy.

334
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,500
Can you imagine?

335
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
Wow.

336
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,660
We have the Bible.

337
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,540
You know, sometimes when we have something,

338
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,980
we don't really appreciate what we have.

339
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,420
There are people all over the world tonight

340
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,739
that don't have a Bible.

341
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,860
They would do just about anything to get a Bible.

342
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,420
They don't have one,

343
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,700
and sometimes we have and we neglect,

344
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
and that's unfortunate,

345
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,100
and so what we must do as we're developing this plan,

346
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,980
yes, we have to start by understanding

347
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,980
who this book is from and what this book is,

348
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,179
and then we have that desire, that expectation

349
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,340
that I wanna hear from God.

350
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,460
I would say this, number three,

351
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,780
as we develop this plan,

352
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,540
we need to prepare to hear from God.

353
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,340
We need to take steps to prepare to hear from God.

354
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,179
How do I prepare?

355
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,700
Well, number one, I better prepare my heart.

356
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,619
The Bible talks of Josiah of having a tender heart,

357
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,059
and oh, how our heart needs to be tender

358
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,460
toward the things of God,

359
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,140
and as we approach the scriptures

360
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,340
that we are preparing to hear.

361
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,619
Deuteronomy 32 and verse 46,

362
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,460
the Bible says this,

363
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,739
and it's such a wonderful truth

364
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,500
in this text of scripture,

365
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,780
nearing the end of the children of Israel

366
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,260
preparing to enter into the land of promise,

367
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,619
and in Deuteronomy 32 and verse 46,

368
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,580
Moses, it says, made an end of speaking, verse 45,

369
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,619
and he said unto them,

370
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,780
set your hearts unto all the words

371
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,020
which I testify among you this day,

372
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,580
which you should command your children to observe.

373
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,260
to do all the words of this law.

374
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,100
And you notice it says, set your hearts onto all the words.

375
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,540
We have a prepared heart when we have that desire

376
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,500
in our heart, I wanna hear from God.

377
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,340
I wanna, I have that desire, but then I'm going

378
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,980
and I'm making the preparation, how am I gonna hear?

379
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,380
Listen, I wonder tonight, when you're speaking to someone,

380
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,580
do you desire that they're listening to you?

381
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,260
When you're speaking to somebody.

382
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,260
If you're talking to somebody, I don't know myself,

383
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,220
I'm gonna grab it, right?

384
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,580
But if you're talking to somebody

385
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,740
and as you're talking to them,

386
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,740
they're just doing this the whole time, does that annoy you?

387
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,340
I'm being honest, does it annoy you?

388
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,380
Do you think that they're listening to you?

389
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,660
No, and there are times in which I've been guilty of,

390
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,620
and I've said to some people, somebody's talking to me

391
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,040
and I said, listen, I'm not ignoring you,

392
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm just trying to find something to be able to use

393
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,880
in our conversation and I try to be careful to do that.

394
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
Why?

395
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,860
Because I want the, I understand the person's talking,

396
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,180
they wanna have somebody that's listening to them.

397
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,340
Let me ask you this, when you pray,

398
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,980
do you want God to listen to you?

399
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,420
Do you want God to listen to you when you pray?

400
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,620
Yeah, no doubt.

401
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,900
I'm thankful for the promise that says,

402
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,540
call unto me and I will answer thee

403
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,800
and show thee great and mighty things

404
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,140
which thou knowest not.

405
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,820
But I'm mindful this evening,

406
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,660
the Bible says this in Proverbs 22 and verse 17,

407
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,100
bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise

408
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,820
and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.

409
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,500
We need to think about the imagery of that verse

410
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,540
where it says bow down thine ear

411
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,820
and hear the words of the wise

412
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,820
and just the imagery that is given there

413
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
and of course we understand

414
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,660
that Solomon is writing to his son

415
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,980
but in a much more greater truth,

416
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,060
it is God writing to his people in the book of Proverbs

417
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,380
and we understand that God is giving us,

418
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,220
he has all wisdom, he is the all wise God

419
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,980
and we need to have prepared hearts, tender hearts.

420
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,060
We need to bow down our ears,

421
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,220
we need to listen and apply our heart

422
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,660
unto the knowledge that God would give us.

423
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,000
I think about our minds

424
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,300
and how we can clear our minds of distractions.

425
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,760
You know, it's easy to be distracted.

426
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,740
I dealt with that a few weeks ago on Sunday morning

427
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,340
of a good soldier and the reality is

428
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,900
that when we come into church,

429
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,420
anytime we come into church,

430
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,340
anytime that we open up our Bible to read our Bibles

431
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,940
in our personal Bible study,

432
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,980
you know that the enemy doesn't like that

433
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,420
and you know that distractions are gonna come.

434
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,140
How many of you have tried to witness to somebody?

435
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,920
You've either gone door knocking,

436
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
tried to witness to someone

437
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,580
or maybe you have had the opportunity

438
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,140
just in some other setting to try to witness to someone

439
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,420
and it seems like just as you're getting to the point

440
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,940
of being able to share the gospel with them,

441
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,000
there's some distraction.

442
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,620
I mean, it could be a phone call,

443
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,860
it could be a baby crying,

444
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,260
it could be as it happened to us on Saturday

445
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,100
that the person says,

446
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,160
well, actually I got something cooking on my stove

447
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,380
and it's on right now so I probably should go

448
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,820
and what am I supposed to say?

449
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,220
No, let your house burn down.

450
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
I mean, it's a tough thing

451
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,140
but the reality is that there are distractions

452
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,660
but it's for you as well.

453
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,160
You open up your Bible in the morning to read

454
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,980
and this happens and that happens

455
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,040
and this distraction and that distraction.

456
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,860
You come into church, especially on a Wednesday evening,

457
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,220
it's in the middle of a work week,

458
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,980
there's all sorts of things going on.

459
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,980
You had things at the office that were undone when you left

460
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,200
and there are things that you have to deal with tomorrow

461
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,500
and there's something going on with the kids

462
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,340
and there's something going on with whatever

463
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,760
and you can come with distractions

464
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,940
and you cannot even hear what God has for you.

465
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,860
So what do we do?

466
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,940
We prepare our hearts, we prepare our minds.

467
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,140
God, help me to eliminate the distractions.

468
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,700
Help me to be focused on what's at hand

469
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,280
because I know you have something for me.

470
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,060
Why?

471
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,380
Because when you come to our church,

472
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,700
you know the Bible's gonna be used

473
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,180
and so if the Bible's being used,

474
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,340
then God is going to speak to his people

475
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,760
and what a blessing that is

476
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,720
but the reality is that there's some preparation

477
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,140
on our part that we need to deal with.

478
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,140
I'm interested and amazed by some cultures

479
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,620
and it's not so common in the American culture

480
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,780
but I've witnessed it in America

481
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,220
and I've witnessed it by a number of other cultures

482
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,320
that as they enter into a church building,

483
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,020
the first thing they do is sit down and begin to pray.

484
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,720
They sit down and begin to pray

485
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,560
and then they stand up and they begin to worship.

486
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,440
Why?

487
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,400
I believe they're trying to get their heart prepared.

488
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,680
I believe they're trying to get focused on,

489
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm here to worship God.

490
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm not bringing in all those distractions of the world.

491
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,180
Let me say this, number four,

492
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,680
I believe that we need to predetermine

493
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,960
that we will agree with God.

494
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,400
Predetermine that we're gonna agree with God.

495
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
You say, well, I don't particularly like what I read.

496
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,460
I don't particularly like what I heard.

497
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,200
You're gonna agree with God or you're not?

498
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
You say, well, isn't there some middle ground?

499
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,540
No, not really.

500
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,480
You're gonna agree with God or you're not

501
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,920
and the reality is that if we predetermine,

502
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,000
we sing that song sometimes when we have a revival meeting,

503
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,520
we sing it before every message of the revival meeting.

504
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
I'll say yes, Lord, yes to your will and to your way.

505
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,800
I'll say yes, Lord, yes to your,

506
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,760
man, I just forgot the words.

507
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,840
With my whole heart, I'll agree

508
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,700
and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

509
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,200
When your spirit speaks to me,

510
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
that was the line that I missed.

511
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,400
When your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart,

512
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,120
I'll agree and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

513
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,280
You open your Bible at whatever time

514
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
you have your time with the Lord

515
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,760
and you come to church for church service,

516
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,720
you predetermine, I'm gonna agree with God.

517
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,520
I'm gonna take the truth that God has given to me

518
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,200
and I'm going to agree that God knows best.

519
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm not gonna lean on my own understanding.

520
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm not going to lean on the cultural understandings.

521
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm not going to, no, I'm gonna agree with God.

522
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,200
Let me use an illustration if I could,

523
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,480
Jeremiah, if you will, chapter 42

524
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,960
and I won't have time to develop all of this.

525
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,160
I'm gonna just kinda pick through about a chapter and a half

526
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,420
very quickly this evening so that we have time for prayer

527
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,100
but in Jeremiah 42, I'm giving you an example here

528
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,020
to close this little, this message tonight,

529
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,980
this example that really helps us be mindful

530
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,320
of the fact that we need to predetermine to agree with God

531
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,700
but looking at an example here in Jeremiah 42

532
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
where they seemingly do that

533
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,440
but then they don't agree with God.

534
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,180
They disobey.

535
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,580
In Jeremiah 42, the Bible says in verse number two,

536
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,180
and said unto Jeremiah the prophet,

537
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,300
let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted

538
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,460
for thee and pray for us unto the Lord thy God

539
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,580
even for all this remnant for we are left

540
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,560
but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us

541
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,120
that the Lord thy God may show us the way

542
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,640
wherein we may walk and the things that we may do.

543
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,300
Now, is that a good request?

544
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,900
I mean, it's a good desire, is it not?

545
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,580
I mean, these people are coming to Jeremiah

546
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,940
and say, Jeremiah, pray for us.

547
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,100
We need to know what to do.

548
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,900
We need to know where to go and what to do.

549
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,140
And Jeremiah in verse four, the prophet said unto them,

550
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,500
I have heard you behold, I will pray to the Lord your God

551
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,800
according to your words and it shall come to pass

552
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,820
that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you,

553
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,340
I will declare it unto you.

554
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,100
I will keep nothing back from you.

555
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,860
Now that's a good prophet of the Lord, is it not?

556
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,460
He says, all right, I'm gonna pray for you.

557
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,120
And I'm gonna give you exactly what God says.

558
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,020
I'm gonna give you the example.

559
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,540
I'm not gonna hold anything back.

560
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,820
I'm gonna give you exactly what God says.

561
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,380
Then verse five, they said to Jeremiah,

562
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,080
the Lord be a true and faithful witness between us

563
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,740
if we do not even according to all things

564
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,740
for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us,

565
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,700
whether it be good or whether it be evil,

566
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,500
we will obey the voice of the Lord our God

567
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,380
to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us

568
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,080
when we obey the voice of the Lord.

569
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,340
After 10 days, the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah

570
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,740
according to verse number seven.

571
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,340
And Jeremiah delivers the message.

572
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,900
He goes and he tells them, and again,

573
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,820
I don't have time to deal with all of this,

574
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,440
but we find that he gives them all of the information

575
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,620
that God had communicated to him

576
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,400
beginning in these verses that we see

577
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,900
that Jeremiah receives after those 10 days

578
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,260
and he calls in verse number eight,

579
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,900
the people back and he begins to deliver the message.

580
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,060
He's declaring it as he promised to do so in verse number four

581
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,800
he's keeping nothing back from them

582
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,460
as he promised in verse number four.

583
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,780
And we find that in verse number, look at verse number 20.

584
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,340
Let's back up in verse 19.

585
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,540
The Lord hath said concerning you, O you remnant of Judah,

586
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,900
go ye not into Egypt.

587
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,460
Know certainly that I have admonished you this day

588
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,700
for ye dissembled in your hearts

589
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
when you sent me unto the Lord, your God,

590
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,980
saying, pray for us to the Lord, our God,

591
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,299
and according unto all that our Lord,

592
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:52,660
the Lord, our God shall say, so declare unto us

593
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,559
and we will do it.

594
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,660
That idea that he says there,

595
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,420
ye dissembled in your hearts,

596
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,380
it means to disguise or to conceal.

597
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,880
It means to conceal one's true motives.

598
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,220
And now verse 21, I have this day declared it to you,

599
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,880
but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, your God,

600
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,420
nor anything for the which he hath sent me unto you.

601
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,820
Now therefore, know certainly that ye shall die

602
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,900
by the sword, by the famine, by the pestilence,

603
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,540
in the place whether you desire to go into sojourn.

604
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,340
Look at chapter 43.

605
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,220
And it came to pass that when Jeremiah

606
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,260
had made an end of speaking at all the people,

607
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,179
all the words of the Lord, their God,

608
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,559
for which the Lord, their God had sent him to them,

609
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,640
even all these words.

610
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,840
Now, just understand,

611
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,440
I know I'm reading through this quickly,

612
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
but get the thought here.

613
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
These people come to Jeremiah.

614
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Jeremiah didn't go to them, amen?

615
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,920
The people came to Jeremiah and they said to Jeremiah,

616
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,080
pray and ask God what we should do.

617
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,440
And here's our commitment.

618
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,140
We're going to obey what God says.

619
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,980
Jeremiah faithfully prays, he faithfully delivers,

620
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,559
but the people do not obey.

621
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,559
Jeremiah ends his speech in verse two.

622
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,960
The Bible says, then speak.

623
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
the son of Uzziah, the son of Azariah,

624
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,960
the son of Hoshiah, and Johanan, the son of Koriah,

625
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,960
and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah,

626
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
by the way, there's a key there in the proud men,

627
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,960
they said to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely.

628
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
The Lord our God hath not sent thee to say,

629
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
go not into Egypt to sojourn there.

630
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Now, understand with me,

631
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,960
what they really wanted to do was go to Egypt.

632
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
You know what they were looking for?

633
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,960
They wanted somebody to tell them, go to Egypt.

634
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
And when Jeremiah said, don't go to Egypt,

635
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
they didn't like it.

636
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
So here's what I'm saying to you this evening,

637
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,960
we need to take and understand as we develop that plan

638
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
for how can I learn to listen,

639
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
and we see that we ought to listen up

640
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
when I approach the Bible,

641
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
when I understand that this is God's authoritative word,

642
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,960
it is God's letter, His message to me as His child,

643
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
I'm desiring to hear from Him,

644
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I'm expecting to hear from Him,

645
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I've prepared my heart, I've prepared my mind,

646
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I've tried to eliminate the distractions as best I can,

647
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
but I must predetermine that I'm going to agree with God.

648
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
What God says, I'm going to do.

649
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
What God says, I'm going to do.

650
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm going to agree with God.

651
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,960
It's one thing for us to say we're going to agree with God,

652
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
it's another thing that we agree with God,

653
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,960
that we take and we apply the truth

654
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
that God has given to us in His word.

655
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Unfortunately, this group of people in Jeremiah 43,

656
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
they did not obey the voice of the Lord,

657
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
they did not obey the message

658
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,960
that God delivered through His man Jeremiah,

659
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,960
and it's a sad reality,

660
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,960
but we find that even today,

661
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,960
even as we look back at Hebrews chapter 2,

662
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
that it says this, and again,

663
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
the last part of that first verse,

664
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
he says this,

665
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed

666
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
to the things which we have heard,

667
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
lest at any time we should let them slip.

668
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Why do they slip?

669
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Is it that we don't remember them,

670
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
or is it that we just simply don't want to

671
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
hearken unto the voice of the Lord?

672
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
You know, we live in a society

673
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,960
where a lot of people want to do what they want to do.

674
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
They want to be their own authority,

675
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,960
their own boss, their own person,

676
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,960
and as believers, as Christians,

677
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,960
we submit to the authority of this book.

678
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Say, God, it's your word,

679
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
I want to hear from you.

680
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,960
I want to give the more earnest heed.

681
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
I don't want it to just,

682
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm not looking for my ears being tickled,

683
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm not looking for somebody to just tell me

684
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
what I want to hear,

685
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm not looking for someone to just

686
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,960
tell me everything is going to be okay.

687
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Sat in my office with somebody on Friday,

688
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
and I said, listen, it is absolutely wrong for us

689
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,960
as the people of God to put our arm around somebody,

690
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
whether physically or just, you know,

691
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
in a imagery kind of a way,

692
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
and say, oh, everything's going to be okay.

693
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
No, everything's not going to be okay.

694
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Everything's not going to be okay.

695
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Oh, you just be you,

696
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
and you just do what you think is right.

697
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

698
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
God's given us a word.

699
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
He's given us the truth.

700
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,960
There's a song, I don't know the entirety of it,

701
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I've only heard it sung one time.

702
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
It talks about preachers,

703
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,960
about standing with courage and with boldness,

704
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
and don't tell us what we want to hear,

705
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,960
but tell us what we need to hear.

706
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
You know, when we go to the Bible,

707
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
in your daily life, when you come to church

708
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
and you hear the Bible taught,

709
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
we need to have a plan on,

710
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
how am I going to hear from God today?

711
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,960
How am I going to, I'm coming prepared

712
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,960
so that I might hear something from God,

713
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,960
so that I might get the instruction that I need,

714
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
so that I can apply the truth in my life,

715
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,960
so that I can be conformed to the image of his dear son,

716
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
so that I can please him with my life.

717
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
We ought to listen up.

718
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Let's pray together.

719
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Father, we love you.

720
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
We thank you for loving us.

721
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Thank you for your word.

722
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I do thank you for the truth that's contained therein.

723
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I pray, Lord, that you'd help us tonight.

724
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,960
We see the danger of not listening up,

725
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,960
of not giving heed to those who ignored,

726
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,960
to those who flat out would not listen,

727
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
to those who rebelled,

728
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,960
to those who denied the authority of the message,

729
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
to those who are scoffers and mockers.

730
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
We see all through the scripture,

731
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,960
all of these examples of those that would not hear.

732
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,960
God, I pray tonight that you'd help us to have a heart

733
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
that longs for thee,

734
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
or a desire to hear from thee.

735
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I pray, God, that you would help us daily

736
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
as we open your word and each service

737
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
that we have the opportunity to attend,

738
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Lord, that we'd have ears to hear.

739
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
We'll thank you for the work that you'll do,

740
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

741
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Amen.

742
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
If you have your prayer bulletin with you this evening,

743
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
we'll start.
