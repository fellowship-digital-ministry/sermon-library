00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Hebrews chapter number two, last week we started this lesson, we ought to listen up.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.000
We've been dealing with this subject matter here on Wednesday evenings, doing what we

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.319
ought to do, and just because we know what we ought to do doesn't mean we do what we

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:13.760
ought to do.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.559
And last week we started with this thought of we ought to listen up, and I knew, and

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.600
I said from the start that I wasn't confident that we'd get through all of the material

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.920
last week, and we certainly did not.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.920
And so tonight's kind of part two of that same lesson.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to very quickly give an overview of what we looked at last week in case you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
were not here, and then we'll get into the follow-up this evening.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.020
But we look at Hebrews chapter two and verse number one, the Bible says, therefore we ought

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.240
to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.360
let them slip.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.639
For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received,

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:59.639
a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.400
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.639
heard Him, God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:13.319
miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.900
And we focus on that first statement of the verse, number one, therefore we ought to give

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.239
the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:28.879
He says this, lest at any time we should let them slip, and we spoke about this idea

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.160
of giving the more earnest heed, that's why I've titled it We Ought to Listen Up, and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.559
we said that we see that, therefore, to begin verse number one of chapter two, and we need

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:39.800
to determine why is it there?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.360
What is it that was given to us in chapter one that is so important that he concludes,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.919
he reaches this conclusion that we ought to pay attention, we ought to give the more earnest

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.879
heed, and so we went back to chapter one last week, we talked about the fact that the book

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.120
of Hebrews deals with the subject matter throughout the book, a theme, that Christ is better,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.319
He is superior, in chapter one He deals with being superior to the angels, but we find

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.279
that the book begins in verse number one that says, God, who at sundry times and in divers

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:17.759
manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, but, notice verse number

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:25.919
two, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.759
of all things, by whom also He made the worlds, who being the brightness of His glory, and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:34.880
the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.919
He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.919
Now if those three verses don't make you want to shout and rejoice, I'm not sure what will,

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:50.240
and the reality is that we serve a great God, we have a wonderful Savior, He is worthy

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.440
of our worship and of our praise, and God reveals here that yes, He spoke, and we understand

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.199
all scriptures given by inspiration of God, and is profitable, and just because if you

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.800
have in your Bible, some people have a red letter edition Bible, listen, the red letters

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.839
aren't more inspired than the other words, because all scripture is given by inspiration

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:17.199
of God, but it is something when God in flesh came to earth, and He walked among them, and

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:24.759
He spoke, remember I said this, that those that heard Him often would say, no man spake

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.360
like this man.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.240
He speaks with power and with authority, and that's because He's God, He is God in flesh,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.320
and we find that the multitudes would come to hear Him, they would hear as they did in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.720
Mark chapter number two, that it was noise, that He was in the city, and all people, they

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.279
wanted to go and hear Him, and they came, and they surrounded the house, there was no

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:53.080
room for anyone to enter in, because there was such a great group of people, and you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.320
find throughout His earthly ministry, there were many that wanted to hear Him, and He

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.199
spoke with authority.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.679
I'm thankful this evening that we have the scriptures, that we have the word of God,

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.919
and we found last week that we said this, that we need to recognize the danger, the

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.919
danger of what?

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.960
Well, the danger of not hearing, the danger of not giving the more earnest heed, as the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.200
scriptures say here, the danger of not listening up, the danger of neglecting personal Bible

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.399
reading, of missing church services, of not hearing the truth that God wants us to hear.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:33.519
We said this, the word hear and understanding of giving a, to that which we have heard and

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:39.279
that idea of hearing is not just to hear, but to hear with the purpose of doing, with

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.359
the intent of obeying.

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:49.739
It's similar to what Samuel was told to say from Eli, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:55.640
And the idea was that he was listening, hearing, with the intent of obeying.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.660
I'm going to obey, I'm going to apply, I'm going to take heed to what you have said.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:06.660
And so we deal with, and we looked at a number of passages of scripture last week, dealing

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.720
with the fact that God has been faithful.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.339
God has been faithful to give his word.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.760
We study the Old Testament, we read multiple times how that God sent prophets and God gave

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.260
his word, but the people would not hear.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.940
Can I tell you this evening that God has been faithful to preserve this book?

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.019
I am so thankful that God has preserved the Bible, that we can have in our hands today,

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:37.859
tonight a, the copy of God's precious word.

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:43.700
The truth of inspiration is so important for us to understand and it's so foundational

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.940
that we understand that scripture, all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.339
It's God breathed, but I want you to know this evening that inspiration without preservation

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.940
doesn't really help any of us today.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.739
Because the originals are no longer with us, but God promised that he would preserve his

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:05.739
word.

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:10.299
And can I tell you that God always does what he says he will do and God has providentially

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:16.820
preserved his word and we have this evening the word, we have the scriptures and what

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.820
a blessing.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.100
I think about Paul, even as he would write to Timothy and he says that from a child thou

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.579
hast heard the holy scriptures, thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:28.700
to make thee wise unto salvation.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.459
No, Timothy didn't have the originals, but Timothy had the copies of the copies of the

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.459
copies that were from the originals.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.820
And Paul said that that was scripture, that was God's word.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.179
He says to those as he's concluding that he's writing and giving some instruction, he says,

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:50.459
bring these things to me, but especially the parchments.

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:51.459
Why?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.779
Because he wanted to have those scriptures and I'm so thankful this evening.

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:01.260
And so if we understand the danger, if we recognize, acknowledge the danger and we're

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.940
dealing with the subject matter of we ought to listen up, then I believe, and what we'll

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.619
focus on studying this evening is how do we learn to listen?

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:16.579
How do we develop a plan for hearing, for listening, for the voice of God?

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:20.579
I made a statement a couple of weeks ago on Sunday evening as I preached about Elijah

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.859
that he heard the voice of the Lord.

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:29.739
We need to get in a place where we hear the voice of the Lord, that we understand that

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:36.100
as we open the precious pages of this book, that God is speaking to me as an individual,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.899
that God loves me, that God has a message for me and I approach it that way.

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:47.619
And so how do we come to this place that we are going to, as we read here, we ought to

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:52.459
give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, less than any time we

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:54.100
should let them slip.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.459
Is it just going to be this, I'm going to work harder?

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:59.859
No, I believe that we need to develop a plan.

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:03.899
And I'm going to share a few things with you this evening that I hope would be a help for

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:04.899
you.

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:10.899
And the first thought is this, it's four simple thoughts, this is not an exhaustive plan for

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:15.579
how we can develop this plan of learning to listen, but the first thought this evening

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:19.739
is that we must remember the authority of God's word.

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:21.579
We must remember the authority of God's word.

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:26.619
I want you to think about this, what we believe about the Bible, what we believe about the

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:32.380
book that you're holding in your hands this evening, will impact how you approach it.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.460
If you just, listen, people have the idea, you can read articles online, you can listen

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:45.059
to people that will stand up and they'll speak for many, many lengths of time and hours and

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:50.700
they'll say this is not the word of God, this is just man's words about God.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.739
Can I tell you this evening, if this is just man's words about God, it's really not that

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:59.500
helpful because you can have your opinion about God and I can have my opinion about

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.820
God and so on and so forth, but I'm thankful this evening that God said that he was going

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.460
to give the word and that all scripture is given by inspiration of God, that he providentially

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.219
preserved it, and it is God's word, and it's not man just writing about what they think

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:21.440
about God, it is God who is the creator of the universe telling us who he is.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.119
And that's awesome.

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:28.940
And when we understand that this word, this Bible, that it's profitable, when we understand

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.020
that it's going to produce fruit, that it's going to be effective, it works in us.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.219
Listen, I know this evening, you're here on a Wednesday evening at church, you've read

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:46.340
the Bible, you know that God's word is effectual, that it works in your heart, the entrance

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:54.340
of thy words giveth light, and what a joy to know the truth of this book, and we must

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.500
remember the authority.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.020
Somebody has, and I think it's a lot of people.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.220
over the years that have used this reference.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.060
But the fact of the matter is that there are some

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.700
that have referred to the Bible

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.420
as being God's love letter to mankind.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.740
And I think that's okay to refer to it that way.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.340
I don't have a problem with that.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.820
And the reality is that when they use that analogy,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.780
they try to remind those that they're speaking to

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.460
of receiving a letter from a loved one.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.300
Now, I know that today, the idea of letter writing

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.340
is kind of not as popular as it once was

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.140
because we have so many other means of communication.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.500
But I want you to know that,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.140
and most of us here this evening,

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.660
we remember when writing a letter

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.340
and dropping it in the box was the only way

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.260
to communicate with people on a regular basis.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.140
I mean, it used to be that they charged you

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.220
by the minute to make phone calls.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.140
You remember that.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.420
You're old enough, just as I am,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.260
to remember when you had to pay per minute

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.540
to make those phone calls.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.140
And so you could drop those letters in the mail.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.340
I remember while we're in college,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.660
my kids, they crack me up.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.020
They say, well, how old were you when you got a cell phone?

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.660
Much older than you are.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.580
And by the way, I paid for it when I got it, amen?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.660
And the reality is that we didn't have cell phones.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.420
And so I'd go into the little mail room

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.660
where we went to college,

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.260
and I'd always go in to look at that box

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.100
to see if there was,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.500
I didn't care if there was a graded report in there,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.740
if there was some note from the dean in there.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.940
No, I was looking for a note from Holly.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.380
And if she had a note put in there,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.620
and it was in there, guess what I did with that note?

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.020
I just set it aside and ignored it.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.860
No, I read it.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.660
And guess how many times I read it?

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.020
Multiple.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.660
I didn't just read it one time.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.820
Sometimes you try to read between the lines.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.380
You know what I'm saying?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.420
You try to figure out,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.180
I wonder what she really means by that.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.980
I wonder, and so on and so forth.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.980
And you can understand, listen,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.700
this book is from the God of the universe,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.900
from our God, who loves us with an everlasting love,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.780
who wants to communicate with us,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.620
and he's given it to us.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.380
And when I remember what this book is,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.660
when I remember that this book is like no other book,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.780
I have books all over my house,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.180
I got books in my library,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.180
I got books on my desk,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.980
I got them in my drawer on my desk,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.460
I got books all over the place,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.060
but there's no book that I enjoy reading

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.220
as much as I enjoy reading this book.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.100
There's no other book.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.220
Listen, if I'm only gonna have time to read one book a day,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.300
it's gonna be this one.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.980
It's not going to be something else.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.060
It's not gonna be some news or some whatever periodical.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.060
No, this book is from by God to me as his child.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.700
And I believe that when we come with that approach,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.420
it's going to really help us to learn, to listen,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.860
to have that ear to hear what God has for me.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.700
Why?

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.100
Because God's speaking to me.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.060
I understand that as we study the scriptures,

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.420
it's important to have proper hermeneutics

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.300
and to interpret the scriptures properly

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.980
and to understand who the letter or the book was written to

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.880
in the time and so on and so forth.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.620
But this book is a divine book.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.980
This book carries with it not only a message

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.580
to the original hearers,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.340
but it carries with it a message to me

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.420
as God's child today.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.620
And that's amazing.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.460
And so we come from that position.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.140
When I come from that position,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.000
it leads me to my second thought this evening,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.380
that I must then desire to hear from God.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.340
Let me say this, not only desiring,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.540
but expecting to hear from God.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.380
I think about this.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.760
I have had the opportunity in recent days

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.960
to be at conferences and hear folks preach.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.980
I don't hear a ton of preaching

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.100
because I often am preaching,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.680
but I do listen to some preaching.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.500
I have opportunity to go to some conferences.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.060
Of course, Sunday night, Brother Damastus preached.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.900
And man, when I come to church,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.620
I'm expecting to hear from God.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.420
When I open my Bible to read each morning,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.320
I'm expecting, I'm desiring to hear something from God.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.840
If I don't have that desire,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.100
if I don't have that expectation,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.780
then I'm not really probably gonna hear from God.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.580
I'm not going to, it's just gonna be,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.500
yep, check the box, I got it done, I made it through.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.980
But I want you to think about this.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.340
Psalm 119 and verse 18,

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.700
we're familiar with the verse of Scripture.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.860
The Bible says that the psalmist cries out,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.500
"'Open thou mine eyes,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.340
"'that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.'"

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.460
You know how often it is?

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.500
Listen, I don't know how many times

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.540
I've read the Bible through,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.740
and I don't say that for any prideful type of reason.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.260
I just really don't know.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.380
I read the Bible through multiple times a year.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.460
I've preached through,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.980
I have, as the pastor of Fellowship Adventist Church

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.580
for 13, a little over 13 years,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.520
I've preached through like 29 books of the Bible, all right?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.380
That's how many books I have preached through,

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.020
verse by verse, chapter by chapter,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.520
but I still read it every day.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.520
You know what I find?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.460
There are times, Kevin,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.780
that I read a portion of Scripture

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.940
that I just got done preaching,

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.560
and God shows me something that I never saw

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.120
the first time that I read it,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.620
or the 50th time that I read it,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.980
or even when I preached it

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.140
and studied to preach that message.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.580
This book is awesome.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.680
And I come to it expecting, desiring to hear from God.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.900
I think about that verse that I quoted in Psalm 118.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.320
I think about the reference to Samuel

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.900
by way of introduction this evening

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.340
when he said, "'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'"

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.700
And those are two prayers that I pray each day

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.500
when I open up my Bible and I begin to read.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.940
I pray those two thoughts from Scripture,

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.900
Psalm 119 and verse 18, and 1 Samuel 3 and verse 10,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.300
because I wanna hear from God.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.780
I wanna hear from God.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.660
Turn over if you go to Psalm 42,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.840
and I want you to see the imagery that God gives us.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.700
It's a text that no doubt you're familiar with,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.860
but I want you to see it this evening.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.340
In Psalm 42, verses one and two,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.460
the Bible says,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.860
as the heart panteth after the water brooks,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.860
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.100
Notice it says, my soul thirsteth for God,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.900
for the living God.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.300
When shall I come and appear before God?

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.660
I wonder if your soul's ever thirsted for God.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.740
You need to hear from God.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.020
You need a message from the Lord.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.460
You're longing to have that communication from God,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.500
and you go to his word and you receive it.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.140
Listen, I've read accounts of individuals

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.220
that have not had the privilege

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.660
of having a Bible like you and like me.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.100
They've been outlawed.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.180
There are people that were killed, martyred,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.860
burned at the stake simply for having a copy of the Bible.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.060
There are people that were Christians

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.220
living under communist rule,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.860
that the communist, even,

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.060
I mean, I'm talking just 100 years ago.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.220
I'm not talking 400 years ago.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.300
In portions of Europe,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.340
you find that just 100 years ago,

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.820
somebody found with a Bible

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.620
how they would face great persecution,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.380
be imprisoned.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.980
I remember reading a story once

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.620
of a young girl that did not have a Bible,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.860
but she attended a church where they preached the Bible,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.260
and she so desperately wanted to have a Bible of her own

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.340
that she'd have the opportunity to read it,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.380
to not just have to only be able to hear it

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.740
when she would go to church,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.500
but that she'd be able to read it every day of her life,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.340
and she enjoyed the opportunity to go to church

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.380
and to hear the preaching,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.140
but man, she just longed to be able to read it every day,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.220
and she asked the preacher if she could have the Bible

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.300
and she would take it each evening

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.940
and bring it back each morning,

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.300
and he didn't know exactly what she was doing.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.180
He thought maybe that she was just reading

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.020
as much as she possibly could,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.780
and she came back, and after a period of time,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.820
he began to inquire.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820
She said, no, I'm not reading it

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.140
because if I just read it,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.380
then I would just read it once and I'm done.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.140
I am writing it down word for word

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.460
so that I can have my own copy.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.500
Can you imagine?

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.380
Wow.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.660
We have the Bible.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.540
You know, sometimes when we have something,

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.980
we don't really appreciate what we have.

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:38.420
There are people all over the world tonight

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.739
that don't have a Bible.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.860
They would do just about anything to get a Bible.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.420
They don't have one,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.700
and sometimes we have and we neglect,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.700
and that's unfortunate,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.100
and so what we must do as we're developing this plan,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.980
yes, we have to start by understanding

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.980
who this book is from and what this book is,

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.179
and then we have that desire, that expectation

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:04.340
that I wanna hear from God.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.460
I would say this, number three,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.780
as we develop this plan,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.540
we need to prepare to hear from God.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.340
We need to take steps to prepare to hear from God.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.179
How do I prepare?

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:18.700
Well, number one, I better prepare my heart.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.619
The Bible talks of Josiah of having a tender heart,

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:26.059
and oh, how our heart needs to be tender

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:27.460
toward the things of God,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.140
and as we approach the scriptures

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.340
that we are preparing to hear.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.619
Deuteronomy 32 and verse 46,

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:35.460
the Bible says this,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.739
and it's such a wonderful truth

00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:40.500
in this text of scripture,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.780
nearing the end of the children of Israel

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.260
preparing to enter into the land of promise,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.619
and in Deuteronomy 32 and verse 46,

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:52.580
Moses, it says, made an end of speaking, verse 45,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.619
and he said unto them,

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:55.780
set your hearts unto all the words

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.020
which I testify among you this day,

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.580
which you should command your children to observe.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.260
to do all the words of this law.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.100
And you notice it says, set your hearts onto all the words.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.540
We have a prepared heart when we have that desire

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.500
in our heart, I wanna hear from God.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.340
I wanna, I have that desire, but then I'm going

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.980
and I'm making the preparation, how am I gonna hear?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.380
Listen, I wonder tonight, when you're speaking to someone,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.580
do you desire that they're listening to you?

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.260
When you're speaking to somebody.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
If you're talking to somebody, I don't know myself,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.220
I'm gonna grab it, right?

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.580
But if you're talking to somebody

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.740
and as you're talking to them,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.740
they're just doing this the whole time, does that annoy you?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.340
I'm being honest, does it annoy you?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.380
Do you think that they're listening to you?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.660
No, and there are times in which I've been guilty of,

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.620
and I've said to some people, somebody's talking to me

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.040
and I said, listen, I'm not ignoring you,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.900
I'm just trying to find something to be able to use

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.880
in our conversation and I try to be careful to do that.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.720
Why?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.860
Because I want the, I understand the person's talking,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.180
they wanna have somebody that's listening to them.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.340
Let me ask you this, when you pray,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.980
do you want God to listen to you?

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.420
Do you want God to listen to you when you pray?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.620
Yeah, no doubt.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.900
I'm thankful for the promise that says,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.540
call unto me and I will answer thee

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.800
and show thee great and mighty things

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.140
which thou knowest not.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.820
But I'm mindful this evening,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.660
the Bible says this in Proverbs 22 and verse 17,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.100
bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.820
and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.500
We need to think about the imagery of that verse

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.540
where it says bow down thine ear

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.820
and hear the words of the wise

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.820
and just the imagery that is given there

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.740
and of course we understand

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.660
that Solomon is writing to his son

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.980
but in a much more greater truth,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.060
it is God writing to his people in the book of Proverbs

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.380
and we understand that God is giving us,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.220
he has all wisdom, he is the all wise God

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.980
and we need to have prepared hearts, tender hearts.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.060
We need to bow down our ears,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.220
we need to listen and apply our heart

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.660
unto the knowledge that God would give us.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.000
I think about our minds

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.300
and how we can clear our minds of distractions.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.760
You know, it's easy to be distracted.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.740
I dealt with that a few weeks ago on Sunday morning

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.340
of a good soldier and the reality is

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.900
that when we come into church,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.420
anytime we come into church,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.340
anytime that we open up our Bible to read our Bibles

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.940
in our personal Bible study,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.980
you know that the enemy doesn't like that

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.420
and you know that distractions are gonna come.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.140
How many of you have tried to witness to somebody?

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.920
You've either gone door knocking,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.040
tried to witness to someone

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.580
or maybe you have had the opportunity

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.140
just in some other setting to try to witness to someone

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.420
and it seems like just as you're getting to the point

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.940
of being able to share the gospel with them,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.000
there's some distraction.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.620
I mean, it could be a phone call,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.860
it could be a baby crying,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.260
it could be as it happened to us on Saturday

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.100
that the person says,

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.160
well, actually I got something cooking on my stove

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.380
and it's on right now so I probably should go

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.820
and what am I supposed to say?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.220
No, let your house burn down.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.220
I mean, it's a tough thing

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.140
but the reality is that there are distractions

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.660
but it's for you as well.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.160
You open up your Bible in the morning to read

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.980
and this happens and that happens

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.040
and this distraction and that distraction.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.860
You come into church, especially on a Wednesday evening,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.220
it's in the middle of a work week,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.980
there's all sorts of things going on.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.980
You had things at the office that were undone when you left

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.200
and there are things that you have to deal with tomorrow

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.500
and there's something going on with the kids

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.340
and there's something going on with whatever

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.760
and you can come with distractions

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.940
and you cannot even hear what God has for you.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.860
So what do we do?

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.940
We prepare our hearts, we prepare our minds.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.140
God, help me to eliminate the distractions.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.700
Help me to be focused on what's at hand

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.280
because I know you have something for me.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.060
Why?

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.380
Because when you come to our church,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.700
you know the Bible's gonna be used

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.180
and so if the Bible's being used,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.340
then God is going to speak to his people

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.760
and what a blessing that is

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.720
but the reality is that there's some preparation

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.140
on our part that we need to deal with.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.140
I'm interested and amazed by some cultures

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.620
and it's not so common in the American culture

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.780
but I've witnessed it in America

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.220
and I've witnessed it by a number of other cultures

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.320
that as they enter into a church building,

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.020
the first thing they do is sit down and begin to pray.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.720
They sit down and begin to pray

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.560
and then they stand up and they begin to worship.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.440
Why?

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.400
I believe they're trying to get their heart prepared.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.680
I believe they're trying to get focused on,

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.000
I'm here to worship God.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.640
I'm not bringing in all those distractions of the world.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.180
Let me say this, number four,

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.680
I believe that we need to predetermine

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.960
that we will agree with God.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.400
Predetermine that we're gonna agree with God.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.000
You say, well, I don't particularly like what I read.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.460
I don't particularly like what I heard.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.200
You're gonna agree with God or you're not?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.600
You say, well, isn't there some middle ground?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.540
No, not really.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.480
You're gonna agree with God or you're not

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.920
and the reality is that if we predetermine,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.000
we sing that song sometimes when we have a revival meeting,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.520
we sing it before every message of the revival meeting.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.760
I'll say yes, Lord, yes to your will and to your way.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.800
I'll say yes, Lord, yes to your,

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.760
man, I just forgot the words.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.840
With my whole heart, I'll agree

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.700
and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.200
When your spirit speaks to me,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.520
that was the line that I missed.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.400
When your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.120
I'll agree and my answer will be yes, Lord, yes.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.280
You open your Bible at whatever time

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.720
you have your time with the Lord

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.760
and you come to church for church service,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.720
you predetermine, I'm gonna agree with God.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.520
I'm gonna take the truth that God has given to me

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.200
and I'm going to agree that God knows best.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.440
I'm not gonna lean on my own understanding.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.160
I'm not going to lean on the cultural understandings.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.280
I'm not going to, no, I'm gonna agree with God.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.200
Let me use an illustration if I could,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.480
Jeremiah, if you will, chapter 42

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.960
and I won't have time to develop all of this.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.160
I'm gonna just kinda pick through about a chapter and a half

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.420
very quickly this evening so that we have time for prayer

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.100
but in Jeremiah 42, I'm giving you an example here

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.020
to close this little, this message tonight,

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.980
this example that really helps us be mindful

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.320
of the fact that we need to predetermine to agree with God

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.700
but looking at an example here in Jeremiah 42

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.700
where they seemingly do that

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.440
but then they don't agree with God.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.180
They disobey.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.580
In Jeremiah 42, the Bible says in verse number two,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.180
and said unto Jeremiah the prophet,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.300
let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.460
for thee and pray for us unto the Lord thy God

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.580
even for all this remnant for we are left

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.560
but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.120
that the Lord thy God may show us the way

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.640
wherein we may walk and the things that we may do.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.300
Now, is that a good request?

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.900
I mean, it's a good desire, is it not?

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.580
I mean, these people are coming to Jeremiah

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.940
and say, Jeremiah, pray for us.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.100
We need to know what to do.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.900
We need to know where to go and what to do.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.140
And Jeremiah in verse four, the prophet said unto them,

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.500
I have heard you behold, I will pray to the Lord your God

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.800
according to your words and it shall come to pass

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.820
that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.340
I will declare it unto you.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.100
I will keep nothing back from you.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.860
Now that's a good prophet of the Lord, is it not?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.460
He says, all right, I'm gonna pray for you.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.120
And I'm gonna give you exactly what God says.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.020
I'm gonna give you the example.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.540
I'm not gonna hold anything back.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.820
I'm gonna give you exactly what God says.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.380
Then verse five, they said to Jeremiah,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.080
the Lord be a true and faithful witness between us

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.740
if we do not even according to all things

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.740
for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us,

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.700
whether it be good or whether it be evil,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.500
we will obey the voice of the Lord our God

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.380
to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.080
when we obey the voice of the Lord.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.340
After 10 days, the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.740
according to verse number seven.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.340
And Jeremiah delivers the message.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.900
He goes and he tells them, and again,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.820
I don't have time to deal with all of this,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.440
but we find that he gives them all of the information

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.620
that God had communicated to him

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.400
beginning in these verses that we see

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.900
that Jeremiah receives after those 10 days

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.260
and he calls in verse number eight,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.900
the people back and he begins to deliver the message.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.060
He's declaring it as he promised to do so in verse number four

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.800
he's keeping nothing back from them

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.460
as he promised in verse number four.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.780
And we find that in verse number, look at verse number 20.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.340
Let's back up in verse 19.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.540
The Lord hath said concerning you, O you remnant of Judah,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.900
go ye not into Egypt.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.460
Know certainly that I have admonished you this day

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:43.700
for ye dissembled in your hearts

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.940
when you sent me unto the Lord, your God,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.980
saying, pray for us to the Lord, our God,

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.299
and according unto all that our Lord,

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:52.660
the Lord, our God shall say, so declare unto us

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.559
and we will do it.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.660
That idea that he says there,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.420
ye dissembled in your hearts,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.380
it means to disguise or to conceal.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.880
It means to conceal one's true motives.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.220
And now verse 21, I have this day declared it to you,

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.880
but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, your God,

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.420
nor anything for the which he hath sent me unto you.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.820
Now therefore, know certainly that ye shall die

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.900
by the sword, by the famine, by the pestilence,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.540
in the place whether you desire to go into sojourn.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.340
Look at chapter 43.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.220
And it came to pass that when Jeremiah

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.260
had made an end of speaking at all the people,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.179
all the words of the Lord, their God,

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:32.559
for which the Lord, their God had sent him to them,

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.640
even all these words.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.840
Now, just understand,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.440
I know I'm reading through this quickly,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.880
but get the thought here.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.880
These people come to Jeremiah.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.880
Jeremiah didn't go to them, amen?

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.920
The people came to Jeremiah and they said to Jeremiah,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.080
pray and ask God what we should do.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.440
And here's our commitment.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.140
We're going to obey what God says.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.980
Jeremiah faithfully prays, he faithfully delivers,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.559
but the people do not obey.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.559
Jeremiah ends his speech in verse two.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:00.960
The Bible says, then speak.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960
the son of Uzziah, the son of Azariah,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.960
the son of Hoshiah, and Johanan, the son of Koriah,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.960
and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.960
by the way, there's a key there in the proud men,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.960
they said to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.960
The Lord our God hath not sent thee to say,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.960
go not into Egypt to sojourn there.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.960
Now, understand with me,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.960
what they really wanted to do was go to Egypt.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.960
You know what they were looking for?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.960
They wanted somebody to tell them, go to Egypt.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960
And when Jeremiah said, don't go to Egypt,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.960
they didn't like it.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.960
So here's what I'm saying to you this evening,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.960
we need to take and understand as we develop that plan

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.960
for how can I learn to listen,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.960
and we see that we ought to listen up

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.960
when I approach the Bible,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.960
when I understand that this is God's authoritative word,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.960
it is God's letter, His message to me as His child,

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.960
I'm desiring to hear from Him,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.960
I'm expecting to hear from Him,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.960
I've prepared my heart, I've prepared my mind,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.960
I've tried to eliminate the distractions as best I can,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.960
but I must predetermine that I'm going to agree with God.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.960
What God says, I'm going to do.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.960
What God says, I'm going to do.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.960
I'm going to agree with God.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.960
It's one thing for us to say we're going to agree with God,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960
it's another thing that we agree with God,

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.960
that we take and we apply the truth

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.960
that God has given to us in His word.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.960
Unfortunately, this group of people in Jeremiah 43,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.960
they did not obey the voice of the Lord,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.960
they did not obey the message

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.960
that God delivered through His man Jeremiah,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.960
and it's a sad reality,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960
but we find that even today,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.960
even as we look back at Hebrews chapter 2,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.960
that it says this, and again,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960
the last part of that first verse,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960
he says this,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960
to the things which we have heard,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960
lest at any time we should let them slip.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
Why do they slip?

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.960
Is it that we don't remember them,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.960
or is it that we just simply don't want to

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.960
hearken unto the voice of the Lord?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.960
You know, we live in a society

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.960
where a lot of people want to do what they want to do.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.960
They want to be their own authority,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.960
their own boss, their own person,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.960
and as believers, as Christians,

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.960
we submit to the authority of this book.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.960
Say, God, it's your word,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.960
I want to hear from you.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.960
I want to give the more earnest heed.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960
I don't want it to just,

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960
I'm not looking for my ears being tickled,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.960
I'm not looking for somebody to just tell me

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.960
what I want to hear,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960
I'm not looking for someone to just

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.960
tell me everything is going to be okay.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.960
Sat in my office with somebody on Friday,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.960
and I said, listen, it is absolutely wrong for us

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.960
as the people of God to put our arm around somebody,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.960
whether physically or just, you know,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.960
in a imagery kind of a way,

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.960
and say, oh, everything's going to be okay.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.960
No, everything's not going to be okay.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.960
Everything's not going to be okay.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960
Oh, you just be you,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.960
and you just do what you think is right.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960
God's given us a word.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.960
He's given us the truth.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.960
There's a song, I don't know the entirety of it,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.960
I've only heard it sung one time.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960
It talks about preachers,

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.960
about standing with courage and with boldness,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960
and don't tell us what we want to hear,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.960
but tell us what we need to hear.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960
You know, when we go to the Bible,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960
in your daily life, when you come to church

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.960
and you hear the Bible taught,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960
we need to have a plan on,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.960
how am I going to hear from God today?

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.960
How am I going to, I'm coming prepared

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.960
so that I might hear something from God,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.960
so that I might get the instruction that I need,

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.960
so that I can apply the truth in my life,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.960
so that I can be conformed to the image of his dear son,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.960
so that I can please him with my life.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.960
We ought to listen up.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960
Let's pray together.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960
Father, we love you.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.960
Thank you for your word.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.960
I do thank you for the truth that's contained therein.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.960
I pray, Lord, that you'd help us tonight.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.960
We see the danger of not listening up,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.960
of not giving heed to those who ignored,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.960
to those who flat out would not listen,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960
to those who rebelled,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.960
to those who denied the authority of the message,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.960
to those who are scoffers and mockers.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.960
We see all through the scripture,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.960
all of these examples of those that would not hear.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.960
God, I pray tonight that you'd help us to have a heart

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.960
that longs for thee,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.960
or a desire to hear from thee.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.960
I pray, God, that you would help us daily

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.960
as we open your word and each service

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.960
that we have the opportunity to attend,

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.960
Lord, that we'd have ears to hear.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.960
We'll thank you for the work that you'll do,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.960
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960
Amen.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.960
If you have your prayer bulletin with you this evening,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.960
we'll start.
