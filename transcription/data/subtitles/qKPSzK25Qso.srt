1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
this evening, 1 Kings chapter 19.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,079
I gave you both in Sunday school

3
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,000
and also in the morning service,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,079
just a word or two about the subject

5
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,680
that we'll be dealing with tonight

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,319
in 1 Kings chapter 19.

7
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,479
I'm thankful for the life of Elijah.

8
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,120
And we find that Elijah and Elisha

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,940
are two great Old Testament prophets.

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,579
There's much that we can learn from their lives.

11
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:22,420
In fact, several years ago on Wednesday evening,

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,600
I did a study in our Bible study on Wednesday night

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,959
through the life of Elijah and the life of Elisha.

14
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,920
And I thoroughly enjoyed that study.

15
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,520
Certainly have the opportunity to be able to go back

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,119
and read these portions of scripture

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,759
and be challenged afresh as we look at these things.

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,599
Elijah appears on the pages of scripture

19
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:45,360
seemingly out of nowhere in 1 Kings chapter 17.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,159
There's not much information given to us

21
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,240
about him and his upbringing and all that sort of thing,

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,599
but he comes onto the page of scripture in chapter 17

23
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,520
and he's standing before Ahab,

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,400
who was a wicked, ungodly, immoral king of Israel.

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,959
We understand that the wickedness in Israel was great

26
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,040
and God was going to bring judgment.

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
And Elijah stood before this wicked king

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,879
who was the son of Amorai.

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,559
And it said that of Amorai,

30
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:15,480
that he did worse than all that were before him.

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,639
And so Amorai was the worst of the worst.

32
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:21,239
And then came Ahab and did even more wickedly

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,339
than his father did.

34
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:24,959
I mean, it was a dim time in Israel's history.

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,300
It was a dark time full of idolatry and wickedness

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,680
and all sorts of things that were contrary to God's word.

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,839
We find that as we read 1 Kings 17 and 18,

38
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,620
really a quick read of those two chapters,

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,639
give us much information about the life of Elijah.

40
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,519
We won't take time this evening to deal with it.

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,199
We're gonna really focus on chapter 19 this evening.

42
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:49,000
But as you study chapter 17 and 18 of 1 Kings,

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,160
you find that the prophet Elijah

44
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,160
served the Lord God Almighty faithfully and courageously.

45
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,080
I love the courage and the faith,

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,319
the faithfulness of Elijah and how he served the Lord

47
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,679
during this very difficult time in Israel's history.

48
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,479
And we find that it was through his hands

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
that God would work miracles

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
and we find amazing things that happen.

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,039
But as you begin reading 1 Kings chapter 19,

52
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,720
you find that things change considerably.

53
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:25,679
The high point, if you will, in chapter 18

54
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,759
is there at Mount Carmel when fire,

55
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,639
God sends fire from heaven to consume the offering

56
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,479
and the prophets of Baal are destroyed.

57
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,039
And I mean, it's a great victory in the life of Elijah,

58
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,440
passage of scripture that truly is exciting to preach from.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,039
It's a favorite, it's a passage

60
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,720
that just preaches so easily

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,479
and there's so much application

62
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,740
that we can get from 1 Kings chapter 18.

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,899
But we come to the 19th chapter,

64
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,300
begin reading in verse number one

65
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
and the Bible says, and Ahab told Jezebel,

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,419
now Jezebel was just as wicked or more wicked

67
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,880
than King Ahab, she was the wicked queen.

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,020
And no one is gonna name their son Ahab

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,619
that has any idea of who Ahab is

70
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,160
and no one in their right mind

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,259
is gonna name their daughter Jezebel, amen.

72
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,619
And we find that Ahab and Jezebel,

73
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,020
they are wicked king and queen.

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,139
And we find that here the Bible says

75
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,139
that Ahab reports to Jezebel all that Elijah had done.

76
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,020
Now understand with me just for a moment

77
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,460
that it was God working through Elijah.

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,839
It was God that did the work,

79
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:35,339
but Elijah is the human instrument that God was using.

80
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,880
And thus Ahab says, this is what Elijah did.

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,460
We know that the prophets, those wicked men

82
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,559
in the 18th chapter were killed.

83
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,619
And we find that Jezebel hears this information

84
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,460
and notice the end of verse one,

85
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,100
how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

86
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,619
And so Jezebel finds out about what's going on.

87
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,059
And as we study through this 19th chapter this evening,

88
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,539
we're gonna look at the first 18 verses.

89
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:05,300
The call of Elisha is recorded in verses 19 through 21

90
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,580
and will not be part of our message this evening.

91
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,020
But as we look at these first 18 verses,

92
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,339
we find that on two occasions,

93
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,779
once here in verse number nine,

94
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,880
and then again in verse number 13,

95
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,959
God asks a question.

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,940
And that question that God asks is going to serve

97
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,519
as the title for our message this evening.

98
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,920
Notice at the very end of verse number nine,

99
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,920
the Bible says, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

100
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,399
And then in verse number 13,

101
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,239
the Bible says again at the very end

102
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,399
of the verse of scripture,

103
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,399
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

104
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,220
In order to preach a message this evening

105
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,660
that I've simply entitled from that question

106
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,619
in verse nine and 13, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

107
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,179
As we look at the passage of scripture,

108
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:56,600
I seek to be able to provide historical content

109
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,739
from chapter 19 of the book of First Kings

110
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,380
and look at the life of Elijah

111
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,260
and understanding the truth of this question

112
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,299
that was asked of Elijah.

113
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,140
But I hope tonight that each of us

114
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,820
could take the portion of scripture

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,899
and we could make application in our own lives.

116
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,940
I hope that tonight,

117
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,700
just as we find throughout the scriptures,

118
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,179
it's important that we're doers of the word

119
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,420
and not hearers only,

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,980
and we find that the scriptures have been given to us,

121
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,320
yes, for us to understand historically what took place,

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,420
but then we take and we apply the truth,

123
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,140
the principles to our lives.

124
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
If we could take liberty this evening

125
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,579
as we go through the message,

126
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,940
here's what I want you to think

127
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,220
when we come to that portion

128
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,779
and we begin to make application in our lives.

129
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,559
Yes, God is saying to Elijah,

130
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,339
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

131
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,380
But I'd like for you to insert your name.

132
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,179
In that question, what doest thou hear?

133
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:52,920
Chris, Tim, Mark, Holly, Lauren,

134
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,799
fill in the blank, all of you.

135
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,640
What are we doing here?

136
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,779
You ever wonder?

137
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,980
People have this question, what am I here for?

138
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,200
What am I doing?

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,059
Sometimes if we're not careful in life,

140
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,399
we can get in a rut.

141
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,940
Just get into the monotony of life

142
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
and just the routine of life

143
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,899
and it's just the same thing over and over and over

144
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,859
and we can ask ourselves, what are we doing here?

145
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,540
What is the purpose?

146
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,619
What does God have for us?

147
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,220
We find in a very real way

148
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,380
that Elijah's in a very particular specific place

149
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,579
and God says, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

150
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,880
But I think that as we take application in our lives,

151
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,100
I hope that as we go through the message this evening

152
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
that we would put that focus in that question on our hearts

153
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,579
as if God were speaking to us this evening.

154
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,179
What are we doing here?

155
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,700
Notice the passage of scripture in verses one and two.

156
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,959
Number one, if you're taking notes,

157
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,500
I want you to first notice the threat.

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,880
After Jezebel hears this report from Ahab in verse number one

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,100
we find that Jezebel then sends a messenger.

160
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,820
She sends the messenger directly to Elijah

161
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,980
according to verse number two and she gives a threat.

162
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,820
Notice the Bible says,

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,260
then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying,

164
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,480
so let the gods do to me and more also,

165
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,579
if I make not thy life as the life of one of them

166
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,239
by tomorrow about this time.

167
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,260
You know what the threat is?

168
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,420
I'm gonna kill you.

169
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,779
I'm gonna have you put to death.

170
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,540
I mean, really, if we boil it down to a single statement,

171
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,820
we find that the threat from Jezebel

172
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,220
was that she was going to have Elijah killed

173
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,760
and by the way, she meant business.

174
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,739
By the way, she's a wicked queen.

175
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,820
She had no problem with this.

176
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,980
She had the power.

177
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,260
She had the resources.

178
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,019
We find that in just a little while

179
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,059
as you go through the book of 1 Kings

180
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,299
and you begin to think about a man by the name of Naboth

181
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,260
and Ahab was disappointed

182
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,299
because he wanted Naboth's vineyard

183
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,940
and he couldn't figure out how to get it

184
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,019
and Queen Jezebel is the one that devises the plan.

185
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,339
She's a wicked woman and she gives this threat.

186
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,980
She says, I'm gonna have your life.

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,579
I'm gonna have you put to death

188
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,019
and by the way, she says at the end of the verse,

189
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:03,779
by this time tomorrow and so it was an imminent threat.

190
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,380
I mean, it was an immediate situation.

191
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,339
It was something in which there was great urgency,

192
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,160
if you will.

193
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,320
Now, I'm thankful this evening to be able to report

194
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,279
that I've never had a threat on my life.

195
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,200
Amen, I hope that you too can be in the position

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,540
in your life where you can say

197
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,160
that I've never had a threat on my life

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,660
but we do know that there are some

199
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,480
that have had a threat placed upon their life.

200
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,119
I do not pretend for any moment of time

201
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,200
to understand what that would be like.

202
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,760
I do not understand I could say

203
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,840
and you could say how you would respond

204
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
or react in a situation like that

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,840
but the reality is I've never been there

206
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,239
so I don't know, amen.

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,599
I see the courage of Elijah in chapter 17 and 18

208
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:49,039
and then I see the threat of Jezebel

209
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,039
to begin chapter 19 and I find that Jezebel's threat

210
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,919
is so significant and has such an impact

211
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,359
with regard to it being carried to Elijah

212
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:06,000
that he immediately is going to depart.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
It was a real situation.

214
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,380
We find that as you look at the text,

215
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,340
we notice the threat but I want you to notice number two,

216
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,159
the trip.

217
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,200
Beginning in verse number three

218
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,919
and down through verse number 14,

219
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,299
we see this trip that Elijah takes.

220
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,919
Notice the Bible says and when he saw that,

221
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,320
he arose and went for his life.

222
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,799
And he came to Beersheba which belongeth to Judah

223
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,840
and left his servant there.

224
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,539
As we begin to think about this,

225
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,000
I want you to think about the life of Elijah

226
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,080
and I want you to think about when he stood there

227
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,440
before Ahab in chapter number 17 and verse number one

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,559
and he delivered that declaration,

229
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,159
a 25-word declaration with regard to the judgment of God

230
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,440
on the house of Israel and we find that after that,

231
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,640
the word of the Lord came to Elijah

232
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,400
and told Elijah where to go.

233
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,219
Where was it that he was to go immediately?

234
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,080
The brook Cherith.

235
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,580
And you read that, God was giving clear direction.

236
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,780
and we find that God says, go to Cherith,

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,340
and he goes to Cherith, and what happens at Cherith?

238
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,240
Well, the water dries up, why?

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Because there's a drought.

240
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,360
Now, by the way, God knew that that would happen.

241
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,140
God knows everything.

242
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,780
But we find that then God speaks to him

243
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,960
and says, go to Zarephath.

244
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,540
Do you find in chapter 17

245
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,200
how God is providing the leadership, the direction?

246
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,140
You know what you miss in chapter 19?

247
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,100
You miss anywhere where God comes to Elijah and says,

248
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,100
go, depart, go to this place, you don't see it.

249
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,620
You see that Elijah, because of the threat

250
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,380
that's been made in verse number two,

251
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
he hears that, he sees that, he's aware of that,

252
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,420
and he rises up and he goes for his life.

253
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,060
The Bible says that he comes to Beersheba,

254
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,800
which belongeth to Judah, and he left his servant there,

255
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,340
but verse four says, but he himself went a day's journey

256
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,700
into the wilderness, and he came and sat down

257
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,320
under a juniper tree, and he requested for himself

258
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,580
that he might die.

259
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,000
He said, it is enough.

260
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,080
Now, O Lord, take away my life,

261
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,320
for I am not better than my father's.

262
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
This is a low point in the life of Elijah.

263
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,040
I mean, this is a difficult,

264
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,340
when you read through chapter 19,

265
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,920
you say, what happened to the guy in chapter 17 and 18?

266
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,200
What's going on in the life of Elijah?

267
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
And we find that he's dealing with this threat,

268
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,640
but he takes this trip and he responds to the threat

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
by fleeing for safety.

270
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,760
And we find that though we might understand

271
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,380
that Jezebel was not aware of his location,

272
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,700
that Jezebel did not know where Elijah might be,

273
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,160
I rejoice in this truth that God knew exactly

274
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,640
where his servant was.

275
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,140
Jezebel put the threat on his life,

276
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,000
but Jezebel had no means of knowing exactly

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,360
where Elijah had fled to, but God, all along the way,

278
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,320
God knew his steps, God knew where he was,

279
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,600
and God meets him.

280
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
And I want you to see in verse number four,

281
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
the Bible, verse number five, excuse me,

282
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,840
it says, and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree,

283
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,680
behold, then an angel touched him

284
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,280
and said unto him, arise and eat.

285
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
When I look at this trip,

286
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,600
I want you to really notice two things

287
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,520
within this thought tonight of the trip that Elijah takes.

288
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,100
I want you to first consider with me the provision of God.

289
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm so thankful that our God is the God who provides.

290
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,480
In fact, that'll be one of the names of God

291
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,640
that we study on that Wednesday night series.

292
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,120
He's the God who provides.

293
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,480
And we begin to think about our lives

294
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,720
and we think about the provision,

295
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,000
and so often, when we consider provision,

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,640
yes, we think about the things that we need,

297
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,160
but you understand that Jesus says twice,

298
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,080
within just a few verses in the book of Matthew,

299
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,280
that God already knows, our Father knows

300
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,960
what we have need of.

301
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,880
We need not to be concerned of those things.

302
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,200
God knows what we have need of.

303
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,220
We understand that God is able to provide for us,

304
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,840
that God is able to meet your needs

305
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,600
and my needs and our needs,

306
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,160
and we can rejoice in that,

307
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,200
and we find that God is going to provide for his servant.

308
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,760
Again, God knew exactly where Elijah was,

309
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,920
and God sent an angel in verse number five,

310
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,080
and that angel touched Elijah.

311
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,800
When Elijah was in that low place,

312
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,140
when Elijah said, take my life from me,

313
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,160
when Elijah was in despair,

314
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,120
God met him and God sent this angel

315
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,060
and said unto him, arise and eat.

316
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,480
Notice verse six, and he looked,

317
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,000
and behold, there was a cake baking on the coals,

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
and a cruise of water at his head,

319
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,040
and the Bible says that he didn't eat and drink

320
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,920
and laid him down again.

321
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
I mean, I'd be absolutely astonished,

322
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,560
and where'd that come from?

323
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,480
What's going on?

324
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,700
I mean, it's an amazing thing, is it not?

325
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,720
The way that God supernaturally,

326
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,680
miraculously provided for his servant.

327
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
That's our God.

328
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
That's who we serve.

329
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
Our God is a real God.

330
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,320
Our God is a God who is able.

331
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,640
You say, but I don't see how.

332
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,200
You don't have to see how,

333
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,520
because God works in the impossible situations.

334
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,680
Because when we look at it and we say,

335
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,640
there's no hope, it's impossible,

336
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,680
that's really the time in which God is ready to work.

337
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,120
For with our God, nothing is impossible.

338
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,480
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

339
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
We find this evening that he laid down again,

340
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,400
according to the end of verse number six,

341
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,560
and the angel of the Lord in verse seven

342
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,400
came again the second time and touched him

343
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,740
and said, arise and eat,

344
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,440
because the journey is too great for thee.

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
And he rose and did eat and drink

346
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
and went in the strength of that meat

347
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,920
40 days and 40 nights into Horeb, the mount of God.

348
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,280
What a meal it must have been.

349
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Amen?

350
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,440
There is nothing that I have ever consumed

351
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
that kept me for 40 days and 40 nights.

352
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,000
And I'm guessing it's not anything

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,080
that you've ever consumed either, amen?

354
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,360
And the reality is that we ate lunch

355
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,260
and in a little while we'll be ready for dinner.

356
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,300
And that's just how it works.

357
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,080
And here we find that God provides.

358
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,040
Just rejoice for a moment this evening that God provides.

359
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
He's a good God.

360
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,640
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

361
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,640
He leads us, He provides for us.

362
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,240
As a good shepherd, the shepherd knows the needs

363
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,080
of the sheep.

364
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,480
Our God knows what we need.

365
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,760
And He provides what we need.

366
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,120
It may not always be the way that we think

367
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,160
or what we might figure that it should be,

368
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
but God always provides.

369
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,640
He's a good God, He's a gracious God.

370
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
But I notice in this trip that Elijah takes

371
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
when he's fleeing for his life

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
that there's not just the provision of God,

373
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,640
but I also want us to consider this evening

374
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,780
the probing of God.

375
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,620
The probing of God.

376
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
Have you ever been asked a question

377
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,480
that's a probing question?

378
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,540
A question that requires you to do some soul searching?

379
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,640
In fact, I believe this evening that really

380
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
the question of that first song that we sang this evening

381
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,820
is such a question.

382
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,940
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus?

383
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,640
Every time I sing that song, it convicts me.

384
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,940
He is worthy of our best.

385
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,000
Not just good enough, not just get by,

386
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,900
but He's worthy of our best.

387
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,660
We're working for the master, the king of the universe.

388
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,500
And here, there's a probing question.

389
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,900
We've used it for the title of our message this evening,

390
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,060
but we find that in verse nine,

391
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,100
the Bible says he came thither into a cave

392
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,260
and lodged there, and behold,

393
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,820
the word of the Lord came to him,

394
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,280
and he said unto him, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

395
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,320
You understand how that's a probing question?

396
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,220
Could I phrase it this way,

397
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,820
maybe a way that we might use it today?

398
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,020
What are you doing here?

399
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,140
What are you doing here?

400
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,140
Why are you here?

401
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,020
Elijah gives an answer in verse 10,

402
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,300
and he says this, I have been very jealous

403
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,780
for the Lord God of hosts,

404
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,260
for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant.

405
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,320
They've thrown down thine altars

406
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,700
and slain thy prophets with the sword,

407
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,140
and I, even I only, am left,

408
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,920
and they seek my life to take it away.

409
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,860
Elijah understood the circumstances,

410
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,620
the conditions in Israel,

411
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,300
and that which he was, and how he was serving the Lord.

412
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,060
He was wrong on his assessment

413
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,820
that he was the only one remaining,

414
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,700
and we'll see that at the end of the text,

415
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,520
but we find that he was, he gave an answer,

416
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,700
but I wanna, I would submit to you this evening

417
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,680
that as you look at the continuation

418
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,160
of the text of Scripture,

419
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,400
that it was probably not satisfactory.

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
Why?

421
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,060
Because in verse number 11,

422
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,900
the Bible says, and he said,

423
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,340
go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord,

424
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,660
and behold, the Lord passed by in a great and strong wind,

425
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,860
rent the mountains and break in pieces

426
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,420
the rocks before the Lord,

427
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,860
but the Lord was not in the wind,

428
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,180
and after the wind, an earthquake,

429
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,500
but the Lord was not in the earthquake,

430
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,360
and after the earthquake, a fire,

431
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,580
but the Lord was not in the fire,

432
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,420
and after the fire,

433
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,760
notice what it says, a still, small voice.

434
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,980
We've often spoken about that still, small voice.

435
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,500
We find that the Bible says that it was so

436
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,480
that when Elijah heard it,

437
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,300
can I pause just for a moment and ask the question,

438
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,260
do you hear the voice of God?

439
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,560
I don't mean audibly,

440
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,520
but I mean, do you hear from God when he's speaking to you?

441
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,640
Do you have a ear that is sensitive

442
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,119
to the voice of the Lord?

443
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
You know, it's amazing how many times

444
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,340
throughout the Scriptures,

445
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,760
you'll find the phraseology of hear.

446
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,900
Let him that hath ears hear.

447
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
And we find this evening,

448
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,600
the Bible says that when Elijah heard it,

449
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,400
sometimes there's noise,

450
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,960
just background noise, right?

451
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,440
And it might not have your attention,

452
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,440
but then you hear somebody's voice that you know,

453
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,200
maybe your spouse, maybe a child,

454
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,440
maybe a parent for a child.

455
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,880
You hear that voice, and it gets your attention, why?

456
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,280
Because you're sensitive to the voice of that individual.

457
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,320
Does that make sense tonight?

458
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,280
We know the voices of people,

459
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,140
no doubt this evening,

460
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,619
if you were to be in a crowd of people,

461
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,340
and if you have a spouse here this evening,

462
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,260
if you have a child here this evening,

463
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,940
and you heard them call out,

464
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,020
if you had a friend, a parent that you knew very well,

465
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,179
and you heard them cry out your name,

466
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,220
you're familiar with their voice.

467
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,500
You hear it.

468
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
Listen, we ought to know the voice of God.

469
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,739
We ought to long to hear from God.

470
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,940
We come to church,

471
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
we don't come just for a social gathering.

472
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,739
We read our Bibles on a daily basis,

473
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:54,940
we don't just read our Bibles

474
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,940
to check a box in a Bible reading schedule plan, no.

475
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,320
and we come to church so we can hear from God.

476
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,780
Because this is the amazing thing,

477
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,080
the God of the universe wants to talk to us.

478
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,780
He has a message for us.

479
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,860
Listen, of all the 7,000 that had not bowed the knee

480
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,240
according to what God said,

481
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,620
in this chapter, He's focused on one, Elijah.

482
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,080
And He's speaking to one, Elijah.

483
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
And what a joy to know that our God loves us

484
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,160
and He cares about us

485
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,840
and He wants to speak to us.

486
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,040
And I wonder tonight, are we listening for the voice of God?

487
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,280
Are we hearing the voice of God?

488
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,160
Are we responding to the voice of God?

489
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,200
You ever find someone that's good at ignoring?

490
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
I mean, like, you know they heard you.

491
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,300
Men, oftentimes, we get accused of having selective hearing.

492
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
Amen?

493
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,240
He says he needs hearing aids.

494
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,560
He don't need hearing aids, he just has selective hearing.

495
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,080
He's not hard of hearing, he just has selective hearing.

496
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,120
And all the women said, praise the Lord, Pastor,

497
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
thank you for helping us out, amen?

498
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,440
But the reality is that sometimes we have that select,

499
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,120
listen, Nova is one.

500
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,360
Can she ignore?

501
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,080
Holy cow, that girl can ignore.

502
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,080
You're like, hey, Nova, Nova.

503
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,040
And man, she ain't paying no kind of attention to you.

504
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,080
She can ignore you and ignore you.

505
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,760
Listen, that's not how we should be with the voice of God.

506
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,440
We ought to be sensitive.

507
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
We ought to be ready to hear it,

508
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,920
longing to hear the voice of God

509
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,760
and responding in obedience to the voice of God.

510
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,400
It says when Elijah heard it,

511
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,800
that he wrapped his face in his mantle

512
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,639
and he went out and stood in the entering of the cave.

513
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
Some people are looking for some big things.

514
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,319
The strong wind, the earthquake, and the fire,

515
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,800
they really didn't impact Elijah.

516
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,639
We know the still, small voice of God.

517
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,800
It calls him to go out.

518
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,479
And he wrapped himself in his mantle

519
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,320
and he went out and stood in the entering of the cave.

520
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,639
And the Bible says,

521
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:16,199
behold, there came a voice unto him and said,

522
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,160
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

523
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,800
Now, if I could make the illustration this evening,

524
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,040
God is our heavenly father.

525
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,919
Do we agree with that?

526
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,000
We are his children.

527
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,600
If you're saved this evening, you're a child of God.

528
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,279
You were born in the family of God

529
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,760
and he became our father.

530
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,960
And what a joy that is.

531
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,880
And I understand that as we study the scriptures

532
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,160
and we get the opportunity to see the truth

533
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,600
of how he deals with us as his children,

534
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,320
he disciplines us and he corrects us.

535
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,800
He loves us.

536
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
There's so many things that he does.

537
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,119
But I look at this passage of scripture

538
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,199
and I'm reminded of how a father might behave

539
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,720
and interact with their children.

540
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Have you ever, maybe a parent,

541
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,279
and I'll understand that God is our father,

542
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,040
but as a parent this evening,

543
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,119
have you ever asked your child a question

544
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,639
and they gave you an answer,

545
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,320
but it wasn't the right answer?

546
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,800
And so what did you do?

547
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,919
You asked the question again, right?

548
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,000
And they look at you and they say,

549
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
well, I already gave you an answer.

550
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Well, I'm asking you again

551
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,880
because obviously it wasn't the right answer, right?

552
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,600
Are we tracking?

553
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
So what does God do?

554
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,600
God didn't change the question.

555
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,680
God asked the same question again.

556
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,520
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

557
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,000
I believe tonight that Elijah could have slept

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,240
on the steps of the palace

559
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,960
and God could have spared his life.

560
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,800
I believe that tonight.

561
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,639
That's the God that we serve.

562
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,600
Listen, I believe tonight that Abraham

563
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,919
didn't have to lie about Sarah being his sister.

564
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,360
I believe that Abraham could have went

565
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
right up into Egypt and said,

566
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,279
she's my wife, what are you gonna do about it?

567
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,919
Why? Because I know God.

568
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,199
I believe that.

569
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,080
And I believe that Elijah could have slept

570
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,880
on the very steps of the palace of Jezebel

571
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,160
and God could have protected his servant.

572
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
That's the God that we serve.

573
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,119
He's able to exceeding abundantly

574
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,040
above all that we ask or think.

575
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,600
And we find this evening that God says,

576
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

577
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,360
Notice in verse 14, he said,

578
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,720
I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts

579
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,000
because the children of Israel

580
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,360
have forsaken thy covenant,

581
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,440
thrown down thine altars

582
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
and slain thy prophets with the sword

583
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,720
and I even I only am left

584
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
and they seek my life to take it away.

585
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,519
Guess what? He gives the same answer.

586
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
But here's what I love.

587
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,279
God is patient.

588
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,399
God is patient.

589
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,200
God's far more patient than I am.

590
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,320
And he's far more patient than you are.

591
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,799
Aren't you thankful for that?

592
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,279
We use the term long suffering

593
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,200
and I love the Bible term

594
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,399
that our God is a God who is long suffering.

595
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,080
And our God is patient with us.

596
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,600
Our God meets us where we are

597
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,679
and he helps to develop us to be what we ought to be.

598
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,839
I think about Gideon and when Gideon's faith was weak

599
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,799
and he asked God for a sign,

600
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,040
guess what God did?

601
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,360
God gave him a sign.

602
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,880
Isn't that gracious of God?

603
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,640
And after God gave him a sign, guess what?

604
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,959
Gideon's faith still wasn't enough.

605
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,160
And so what does Gideon do?

606
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,880
He asked for another sign and what does God do?

607
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,279
God gives another sign.

608
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,160
We serve a God who is so gracious.

609
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,040
He's so loving.

610
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,440
Listen, Elijah gave an answer to the question,

611
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,839
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

612
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,160
And he gave a response and he gives the same response

613
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,200
to the question two times when we find that God,

614
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,880
instead of going through and beating him over the head,

615
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
we find that God responds in patient, loving kindness.

616
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,799
Our God is so merciful.

617
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,799
But I want you to understand this evening

618
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,760
that when we look at the trip of Elijah,

619
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,040
when we look at his response to the threat

620
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,080
that was given to flee for his own safety,

621
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
that in that time of fleeing,

622
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
we still see the provision of God,

623
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
but we see the probing of God.

624
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,200
And this evening I'm focused on that thought

625
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,559
of the probing of God.

626
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,000
What are we doing?

627
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,959
Why are we here?

628
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,399
What's the purpose?

629
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,200
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

630
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,640
But in a real sense, each of us could put our name

631
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,640
in place of Elijah, and I wonder what our answer

632
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,600
would be to God.

633
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,880
If God were to come down to you this evening

634
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,200
and say, what are you doing here?

635
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,720
What would you say?

636
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,040
What would your answer be?

637
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,600
We find that God knows where we are.

638
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,440
He knows why we're where we are.

639
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,959
He knows where we're supposed to be.

640
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,720
The question is, do we know why we are where we are?

641
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,000
We notice in the next few verses of our text of Scripture,

642
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,360
not only the trip, we see the threat, the trip,

643
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,799
and then I want you to notice the task.

644
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,200
God reveals his plans for Elijah.

645
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,760
There's a task that needs to be completed.

646
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,279
According to verses 15 through 18,

647
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,799
there's three specific things that God reveals to Elijah.

648
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,000
Notice it says in verse 15,

649
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,559
and the Lord said unto him,

650
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus,

651
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,239
and when thou comest, anoint Haziel to be king over Syria.

652
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,000
Jehu, the son of Nimshi,

653
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
shall thou anoint to be king over Israel,

654
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,440
and Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah,

655
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

656
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,880
And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth

657
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,200
the sword of Haziel shall Jehu slay,

658
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu

659
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,239
shall Elisha slay.

660
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:07,239
In verses 15 and 16, God gives revelation to Elijah

661
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,600
with regard to the task that Elijah had,

662
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,080
and the task was threefold.

663
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,279
Number one, he was to anoint Haziel to be king of Syria,

664
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,279
according to verse number 15.

665
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,600
He was to anoint Jehu to be the king of Israel,

666
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,519
according to verse 16,

667
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,839
and Elisha to be the prophet in his place,

668
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,000
according to verse number 16.

669
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,839
We find that as we look at this task that is given,

670
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,760
that even though Elisha says in the beginning of the text,

671
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,359
when he first flees, he says, in verse number four,

672
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,440
that he requested for himself that he might die,

673
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,280
and said, it is enough now, O Lord,

674
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,940
take my life, for I am not better than my father's.

675
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,440
Listen, God still had a plan for Elijah.

676
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,080
God still had a task for Elijah to complete.

677
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,559
There was still a work for Elijah to do,

678
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,359
and we find that in this position,

679
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,919
in this circumstance that Elijah finds himself,

680
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,799
we find that God, in his grace and his mercy,

681
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,280
he says, I have a task for you.

682
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,359
In other words, when I'm asking you what you're doing here,

683
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,720
yes, there was a location where Elijah was,

684
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,039
but Elijah was in a place

685
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,320
where he was not going to be able to fulfill

686
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,940
the task that God had for him.

687
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,479
Notice what God says in beginning to reveal this task,

688
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,960
revealing the plan.

689
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,640
He says, in verse number 15,

690
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,960
go return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus,

691
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,200
and he's gonna go and anoint Haziel to be king over Syria.

692
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,559
He could not anoint Haziel, Jehu, or Elisha

693
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,400
from the place where he was.

694
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,580
He was in the wrong place.

695
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,440
He fled because of a threat,

696
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,840
and because he fled, he took this trip,

697
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,880
and he finds himself in this cave.

698
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,880
He finds himself in this place of being in this location

699
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,859
where he's not going to be able to fulfill

700
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,179
the task that God has for him.

701
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,880
Where we are is important.

702
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,680
Where we are is important.

703
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
Someone said this to me last week,

704
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
we were chatting on the phone,

705
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,640
and they said, I know exactly why God has me

706
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,240
at the job where he has me,

707
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
because there are people that need to hear the gospel,

708
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,280
and I've had so many opportunities.

709
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
You know what that does to my heart?

710
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,380
It thrills my soul.

711
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,220
Why?

712
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,680
Because that individual understands

713
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,120
that the job that they have

714
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,200
is more than just providing an income

715
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,840
or some level of benefits,

716
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,040
that they have the perspective

717
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,060
that they're an ambassador of Christ in that place,

718
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,500
because where we are matters.

719
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,860
And we find that this task that God had for Elijah

720
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,540
was specific in nature.

721
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,180
There were three people that he was to anoint

722
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,860
to have positions in,

723
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,440
the king of Syria, of Israel,

724
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,220
and then Elisha to be a prophet in his room and his stead,

725
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,260
and we find that those were specific things,

726
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,820
but I want you to understand tonight

727
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,400
that God has a task for us.

728
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,060
God has a task for us.

729
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,140
God has a work for us to do.

730
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,580
How appropriate tonight.

731
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,020
I had no idea what the songs were for tonight

732
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,180
until tonight,

733
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,300
because I saw the numbers,

734
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
but I didn't know what the songs were,

735
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,460
and have I done my best for Jesus

736
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,020
and work for the night is coming.

737
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,940
How appropriate that those two songs,

738
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,260
I feel like in my spirit tonight

739
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,740
that they blend so well with this text of scripture,

740
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,380
because God has a task for us.

741
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,580
But here's the thing.

742
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,900
We can't allow the threats from others

743
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,820
to take us on a trip somewhere

744
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,820
that will keep us from fulfilling the task.

745
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,580
That's exactly what the enemy wants to do.

746
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,620
Elijah had an enemy named Jezebel.

747
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,020
We have an enemy named Satan.

748
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,420
And Satan will threaten us.

749
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,260
It's the tactic that he used in the book of Acts.

750
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,480
He used the religious leaders of the day

751
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,100
to threaten the disciples

752
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,820
of not speaking in the name of Jesus any longer.

753
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,300
They bring these threats.

754
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
Why?

755
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,980
Because they wanna shut us down.

756
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,780
They wanna keep us from fulfilling

757
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,900
what God has called us to do.

758
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,500
God's given us a task.

759
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,100
What happens if we're not careful,

760
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,500
that threat comes and we take a trip like Elijah did.

761
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,980
We go someplace and in that place,

762
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,460
we're not able to fulfill the task that God has for us.

763
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,980
Tonight, God has a task for us.

764
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,900
Individually and corporately as a church,

765
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,860
he has a task for us to complete.

766
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,220
There's a work to be done.

767
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:34,940
So we begin to think about this question this evening

768
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,220
as we kinda conclude here tonight.

769
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,380
We think about this recurring question in 1 Kings 19.

770
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,700
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

771
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,500
And I wonder tonight, if we were to be asked that question,

772
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,700
how well we would be able to answer the question.

773
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
I wonder tonight if we would have assurance

774
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,940
of being able to stand and say with absolute certainty

775
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,100
that I know that I'm in the place where God wants me to be,

776
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,660
doing the work that God wants me to do,

777
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,020
that I have that confidence, that assurance.

778
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,340
I want you to think about Joseph

779
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,059
and use two examples tonight by way of closing.

780
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,139
I want you to look back at Genesis chapter 45

781
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:12,340
and many of us are familiar with the life of Joseph

782
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,100
and what a great life it is.

783
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,419
Of course, not long ago, we finished up on Sunday nights

784
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,860
looking and studying through the book of Genesis

785
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
and of course, the latter chapters

786
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,460
dealing specifically with the life of Joseph.

787
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,059
We come to Genesis chapter 45 and this is the place

788
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,620
in which Joseph reveals his identity to his brethren.

789
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,820
We find that his brothers have come,

790
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,260
they're seeking sustenance

791
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,059
and he had made himself unknown to them

792
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,300
and now he's revealed his identity.

793
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,860
And in chapter number 45 in verse number seven,

794
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,820
after he revealed his identity

795
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,260
and he says they were troubled

796
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,100
according to verse number three at his presence

797
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,779
and he calls them close to him

798
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,940
and he begins to communicate with them

799
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,139
and he says in verse number seven,

800
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,040
notice what he says, and God sent me before you

801
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,620
to preserve you a posterity in the earth

802
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,779
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

803
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,300
So, verse number eight, now it was not you

804
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,620
that sent me hither, but God

805
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,740
and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh

806
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,980
and Lord of all his house and a ruler

807
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,020
throughout all the land of Egypt.

808
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,940
See, sometimes what happens in life

809
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,339
is we don't really know why we're where we are

810
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,540
and then we don't finish and complete the task

811
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,940
that God has for us in that place.

812
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,080
What if Joseph ended up in Egypt

813
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,980
and just decided that he'd have a pity party

814
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,459
for all of his days in Egypt

815
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:30,260
and just lay around and do nothing

816
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,820
and just sulk and sorrow and woe is me

817
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,860
and it's not fair and everybody else is doing this

818
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,320
and I'm stuck with this.

819
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,320
No, he said God is in control

820
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,279
and God sent me here.

821
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,619
I don't believe that Joseph knew on the first day

822
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,959
all that we know about the life of Joseph on this day.

823
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,480
Joseph lived life day by day, just like we do

824
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,959
and Joseph had no idea that he would end up

825
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,080
second in command, that he would have all of that,

826
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,119
but you know what Joseph did?

827
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,320
He had his eyes on the Lord

828
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
and knew that God had a purpose

829
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,640
and God had a plan and he says to his brothers,

830
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,260
don't be afraid, God sent me here.

831
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,360
He knew that he was there for a purpose.

832
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,679
He knew that God was using him at that time

833
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,800
in chapter 50 after Jacob dies

834
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,520
and his brothers are concerned

835
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,279
that now Joseph would seek revenge

836
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,860
because now that dad is gone,

837
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,200
there's no hope for us to be saved,

838
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,480
to be delivered, that Joseph will get recompense

839
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,040
for what we did to him

840
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,239
because the brothers knew what they did was wrong

841
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,720
and they thought, well, so long as dad was alive

842
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,320
that their life was protected in some manner

843
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,520
and now that dad is gone, then our life is in jeopardy

844
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,839
and so they devised this story in Genesis 50

845
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,320
and I won't deal with all of it,

846
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,520
but they tell him, dad told us to tell you this

847
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,559
before he died, but notice as Joseph responds to that

848
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,360
in verse number 19, he says that Joseph said unto them,

849
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,399
fear not, for am I in the place of God,

850
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,459
but as for you, you thought evil against me,

851
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:07,160
but God meant it unto good to bring to pass

852
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,480
as it is this day to save much people alive.

853
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,679
You ever wonder the magnitude of the work

854
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,360
that Joseph did in Egypt?

855
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,779
I mean, literally scores of people,

856
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:28,339
I can't even put the number of people's lives

857
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,339
that were spared because he was confident

858
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,260
that he was where he was supposed to be for a reason.

859
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:38,540
I want you to think about Mordecai,

860
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
turn to the book of Esther, if you will.

861
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,980
Esther chapter number four.

862
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
We know some things about the book of Esther.

863
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,839
In fact, not long ago, we had a Bible quiz

864
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,679
on the book of Esther.

865
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,420
Brother Jeff was teaching some Sunday school lessons

866
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,820
on the book of Esther.

867
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,739
It's a great book.

868
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,260
I actually preached through the book several years ago.

869
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,179
Our theme for that particular calendar year

870
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:08,520
was from this verse, for such a time as this.

871
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,100
I believe, Ronnie, you can correct me

872
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,980
because you know all of it, but I think it was 2016

873
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,459
that that was our theme for the calendar year.

874
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:19,300
Ronnie tells me, he reminds me regularly, he quizzes me.

875
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,540
He says, pastor, do you remember what the theme was in 2015?

876
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,380
I have no idea, but I have a record of it.

877
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,619
I can go look, but I believe it was 2016

878
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,899
for such a time as this.

879
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,300
I want you to understand there's some things

880
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,260
that take place in this particular book,

881
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,899
and of course, I cannot develop all of it for sake of time,

882
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,660
but Mordecai had a perspective,

883
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,580
and he has some correspondence in chapter number four

884
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,760
between him and Esther because of the threat

885
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,459
that's been given with regard to the Jewish people

886
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:51,339
being annihilated, and of course,

887
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:53,220
Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people,

888
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,580
and all that was taking place,

889
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,459
and we find this correspondence comes back and forth,

890
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,420
and verse number 12, I'll pick it up.

891
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,339
They told to Mordecai Esther's words.

892
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:03,899
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther,

893
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,619
think not with thyself that thou shalt escape

894
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,800
in the king's house more than all the Jews.

895
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,179
In other words, he's saying to her,

896
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:12,540
just because you're in that place

897
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,580
doesn't mean there's going to be safety there.

898
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,779
Haman was a wicked man.

899
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:17,739
He wanted all the Jewish people killed,

900
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:20,140
and of course, we understand the influence of Satan

901
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,220
in that situation to destroy the messianic line,

902
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,700
and so on and so forth, but in verse 14, it says,

903
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,300
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,

904
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,539
then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise

905
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:32,840
to the Jews from another place.

906
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,900
You know what Mordecai had?

907
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,700
He had confidence and faith that God would deliver them,

908
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,299
that God would raise up somebody,

909
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:40,340
but notice what he says,

910
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,419
but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed,

911
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:45,220
and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom

912
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,539
for such a time as this?

913
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,299
That you've come to the kingdom for such a time as this.

914
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,020
You begin to think about the perspective of Mordecai

915
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,940
with regard to the subject that we're dealing with

916
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,700
from 1 Kings 19, when God says to Elijah,

917
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,220
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

918
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,340
When we ask ourselves as if God were asking us tonight,

919
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,380
what are we doing here?

920
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,500
I wonder tonight, do we have that perspective of Joseph,

921
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,460
that assurance that I know that I'm in the place

922
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,539
where God has me?

923
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:15,419
Do we have the perspective of Mordecai

924
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:19,820
that God has me here for such a time as this?

925
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,500
You know, so often I hear people,

926
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,900
and I don't mean to say anyone here specifically,

927
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,179
there's no one that I have specifically in mind

928
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,619
that's in the congregation this evening,

929
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,900
but I hear generally speaking in our world today

930
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,700
about how difficult the days are in which we're living,

931
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,299
and I understand they're difficult days,

932
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:41,099
but understand that God has us here for such a time as this.

933
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,780
I've heard people complaining about the day

934
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,660
in which we're living,

935
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,020
and they seem to wanna curse the day,

936
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,140
but the reality is that God has called us to be the light

937
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,179
in a dark, wicked world,

938
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:54,619
and we're here for such a time as this.

939
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:57,099
And so we must be able to answer the question this evening,

940
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:58,299
what are we doing here?

941
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:05,879
here. I know that God words it, what doest thou hear, Elijah? But if I could say it this

942
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:11,599
evening and I could ask us tonight by closing and beginning our invitation, what are we

943
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,519
doing here? I have asked myself that question so many times this week as God just arrested

944
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:26,439
my attention on 1 Kings 19. It just caused me to really do some examination. What are

945
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:33,719
we doing? What are we doing? Why does God have us here? If God was done with us, He'd

946
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:40,039
take us home. I believe that. I believe that if you're here tonight, if you're living and

947
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:45,039
breathing then God has a purpose for you. To boil this purpose down into one statement

948
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,159
as I taught in our Sunday school class this morning, your purpose and my purpose in life

949
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:57,039
is to bring glory to God. To bring glory to God. What are we doing? Are we bringing glory

950
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:02,279
to God? I said this in the Sunday school class this morning. It's a marriage class. We're

951
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,079
talking about the purpose in marriage and the purpose of our individual lives is to

952
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,359
bring glory to God as His people. But for those that are married, that individual responsibility

953
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,679
to bring glory to God doesn't cease when you join together, it's just doubled. Now as a

954
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:23,279
marriage, as a family, as a unit, we're to bring glory to God. You know the church has

955
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:27,599
a responsibility to bring glory to God. But the church is not the building, it's the people

956
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,679
and the church can only bring glory to God if the people are bringing glory to God. Elijah's

957
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:41,159
asked a very probing question. Elijah gives, I believe, the wrong answer on two occasions.

958
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:48,519
I didn't read verse 18, but God says to him, I have 7,000 that have not bowed the knee.

959
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:54,839
Elijah thought he was the only one. God corrects him in verse 18. But I wonder tonight if we

960
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:01,159
were to truly just examine ourselves and say, as if God were speaking to us, what am I doing

961
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,919
here? What am I doing here? I know it's time to be done, but I asked a man a question several

962
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:16,359
years ago. Their son came to our vacation Bible school, we were doing follow-up visits,

963
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:23,279
and I sat in his living room, Holly was with me. As I chatted with that man, he shared

964
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:29,479
a number of things with me. And he said, let me ask you this, if I could, 500 years from

965
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:35,879
now, what's really going to matter? And he said, 500 years from now? I mean he was shocked

966
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:40,919
at the question. I used the number 500 years because the reality is that none of us are

967
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:50,519
going to be around in 500 years. I would venture to say that most of us, unless we do something

968
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:57,519
extraordinary, are not even going to be known in 500 years. Most people have a difficult

969
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:06,919
time tracing their genealogy that far back. But what we do for Jesus is going to count.

970
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:15,319
And we really got to know, why are we here? You know why we're here? To work for Jesus.

971
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,599
To bring honor and glory to His name. To glorify Him. It doesn't mean that there's nothing

972
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,479
else that we do. It just means that all those other things are things that are working together

973
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:35,879
to accomplish that purpose, that singular goal. What are we doing here? The right answer

974
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:43,039
is that we're here to bring honor and glory to God. In Elijah's life, he was in a place,

975
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:49,719
because he took a trip, because of a threat, that left him in a place where he could not

976
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:59,359
fulfill the task that God had for him. He could not anoint Haziel, Jehu, and Elisha

977
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:07,839
from that cave. He had to get out and he had to go so that he could fulfill the task that

978
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:17,279
God had for him. You know what he did? He went. And he did. And you can read, not in

979
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,839
chapter 18, you can read of Elisha in the end of chapter 18, 19, excuse me. We can read

980
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,879
and you can see how God used Elijah to complete those three things. Because our God had a

981
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:33,479
task for him. And when God's done with us, when our task is complete, guess what He'll

982
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:36,799
do? He'll do the same thing He did in Elijah's life. Now we're probably not going to go up

983
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:42,359
with the chariot like He did, but we'll take our final breath here and enter into the presence

984
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:47,519
of our Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I

985
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:55,679
pray God that You would help us tonight. Thank You for working in my heart over these last

986
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:03,279
several days from this portion of Scripture, challenging me. And Lord, I pray tonight that

987
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:12,039
in a very real way that You'd help each of us to truly examine ourselves, our lives.

988
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:18,119
Lord, may I answer the question, what are we doing here? Am I bringing glory to Your

989
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,279
name? Am I fulfilling the task that You've left for me to do? And I pray that we'd be

990
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:29,399
honest and humble this evening. I pray God that You'd stir us up. I pray that as we have

991
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:36,799
that process of examination, that as You point things out in our lives that require adjustment,

992
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,079
Lord, I pray that You would help us to make the adjustments. Just as a pilot would have

993
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,759
to make adjustments for a smooth landing to avoid crash and burn. God, I pray that we

994
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:55,159
would be sensitive and that we would make the adjustments so that we would be able to

995
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:04,039
fulfill, complete the work that You've given for us to do. Well, thank You for the work

996
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:06,119
that You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
