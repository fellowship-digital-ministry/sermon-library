00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
this evening, 1 Kings chapter 19.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.079
I gave you both in Sunday school

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.000
and also in the morning service,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.079
just a word or two about the subject

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.680
that we'll be dealing with tonight

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.319
in 1 Kings chapter 19.

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.479
I'm thankful for the life of Elijah.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.120
And we find that Elijah and Elisha

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.940
are two great Old Testament prophets.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.579
There's much that we can learn from their lives.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.420
In fact, several years ago on Wednesday evening,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.600
I did a study in our Bible study on Wednesday night

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.959
through the life of Elijah and the life of Elisha.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:29.920
And I thoroughly enjoyed that study.

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.520
Certainly have the opportunity to be able to go back

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.119
and read these portions of scripture

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.759
and be challenged afresh as we look at these things.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.599
Elijah appears on the pages of scripture

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:45.360
seemingly out of nowhere in 1 Kings chapter 17.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.159
There's not much information given to us

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.240
about him and his upbringing and all that sort of thing,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.599
but he comes onto the page of scripture in chapter 17

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.520
and he's standing before Ahab,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.400
who was a wicked, ungodly, immoral king of Israel.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.959
We understand that the wickedness in Israel was great

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.040
and God was going to bring judgment.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.040
And Elijah stood before this wicked king

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.879
who was the son of Amorai.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:12.559
And it said that of Amorai,

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:15.480
that he did worse than all that were before him.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.639
And so Amorai was the worst of the worst.

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:21.239
And then came Ahab and did even more wickedly

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:22.339
than his father did.

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:24.959
I mean, it was a dim time in Israel's history.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.300
It was a dark time full of idolatry and wickedness

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.680
and all sorts of things that were contrary to God's word.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.839
We find that as we read 1 Kings 17 and 18,

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.620
really a quick read of those two chapters,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.639
give us much information about the life of Elijah.

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.519
We won't take time this evening to deal with it.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.199
We're gonna really focus on chapter 19 this evening.

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:49.000
But as you study chapter 17 and 18 of 1 Kings,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.160
you find that the prophet Elijah

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160
served the Lord God Almighty faithfully and courageously.

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:01.080
I love the courage and the faith,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.319
the faithfulness of Elijah and how he served the Lord

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.679
during this very difficult time in Israel's history.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.479
And we find that it was through his hands

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.800
that God would work miracles

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.440
and we find amazing things that happen.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.039
But as you begin reading 1 Kings chapter 19,

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.720
you find that things change considerably.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.679
The high point, if you will, in chapter 18

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.759
is there at Mount Carmel when fire,

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.639
God sends fire from heaven to consume the offering

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.479
and the prophets of Baal are destroyed.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.039
And I mean, it's a great victory in the life of Elijah,

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.440
passage of scripture that truly is exciting to preach from.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.039
It's a favorite, it's a passage

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.720
that just preaches so easily

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.479
and there's so much application

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.740
that we can get from 1 Kings chapter 18.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.899
But we come to the 19th chapter,

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.300
begin reading in verse number one

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300
and the Bible says, and Ahab told Jezebel,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.419
now Jezebel was just as wicked or more wicked

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.880
than King Ahab, she was the wicked queen.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.020
And no one is gonna name their son Ahab

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.619
that has any idea of who Ahab is

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.160
and no one in their right mind

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.259
is gonna name their daughter Jezebel, amen.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.619
And we find that Ahab and Jezebel,

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.020
they are wicked king and queen.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.139
And we find that here the Bible says

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.139
that Ahab reports to Jezebel all that Elijah had done.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.020
Now understand with me just for a moment

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.460
that it was God working through Elijah.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.839
It was God that did the work,

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:35.339
but Elijah is the human instrument that God was using.

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.880
And thus Ahab says, this is what Elijah did.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.460
We know that the prophets, those wicked men

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.559
in the 18th chapter were killed.

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.619
And we find that Jezebel hears this information

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.460
and notice the end of verse one,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.100
how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.619
And so Jezebel finds out about what's going on.

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.059
And as we study through this 19th chapter this evening,

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.539
we're gonna look at the first 18 verses.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:05.300
The call of Elisha is recorded in verses 19 through 21

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.580
and will not be part of our message this evening.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.020
But as we look at these first 18 verses,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.339
we find that on two occasions,

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.779
once here in verse number nine,

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.880
and then again in verse number 13,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.959
God asks a question.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.940
And that question that God asks is going to serve

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.519
as the title for our message this evening.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.920
Notice at the very end of verse number nine,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.920
the Bible says, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.399
And then in verse number 13,

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:37.239
the Bible says again at the very end

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:38.399
of the verse of scripture,

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.399
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.220
In order to preach a message this evening

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.660
that I've simply entitled from that question

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.619
in verse nine and 13, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:54.179
As we look at the passage of scripture,

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.600
I seek to be able to provide historical content

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.739
from chapter 19 of the book of First Kings

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:00.380
and look at the life of Elijah

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.260
and understanding the truth of this question

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.299
that was asked of Elijah.

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:06.140
But I hope tonight that each of us

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.820
could take the portion of scripture

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.899
and we could make application in our own lives.

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:11.940
I hope that tonight,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.700
just as we find throughout the scriptures,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.179
it's important that we're doers of the word

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:16.420
and not hearers only,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.980
and we find that the scriptures have been given to us,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.320
yes, for us to understand historically what took place,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.420
but then we take and we apply the truth,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.140
the principles to our lives.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.140
If we could take liberty this evening

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.579
as we go through the message,

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.940
here's what I want you to think

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.220
when we come to that portion

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.779
and we begin to make application in our lives.

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.559
Yes, God is saying to Elijah,

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.339
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.380
But I'd like for you to insert your name.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.179
In that question, what doest thou hear?

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:52.920
Chris, Tim, Mark, Holly, Lauren,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.799
fill in the blank, all of you.

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:55.640
What are we doing here?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.779
You ever wonder?

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.980
People have this question, what am I here for?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.200
What am I doing?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.059
Sometimes if we're not careful in life,

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:05.399
we can get in a rut.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:08.940
Just get into the monotony of life

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.420
and just the routine of life

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.899
and it's just the same thing over and over and over

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.859
and we can ask ourselves, what are we doing here?

00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:18.540
What is the purpose?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.619
What does God have for us?

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.220
We find in a very real way

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.380
that Elijah's in a very particular specific place

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.579
and God says, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.880
But I think that as we take application in our lives,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.100
I hope that as we go through the message this evening

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.100
that we would put that focus in that question on our hearts

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.579
as if God were speaking to us this evening.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.179
What are we doing here?

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:44.700
Notice the passage of scripture in verses one and two.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.959
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.500
I want you to first notice the threat.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.880
After Jezebel hears this report from Ahab in verse number one

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.100
we find that Jezebel then sends a messenger.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.820
She sends the messenger directly to Elijah

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.980
according to verse number two and she gives a threat.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.820
Notice the Bible says,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.260
then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.480
so let the gods do to me and more also,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.579
if I make not thy life as the life of one of them

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:13.239
by tomorrow about this time.

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:14.260
You know what the threat is?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.420
I'm gonna kill you.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.779
I'm gonna have you put to death.

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.540
I mean, really, if we boil it down to a single statement,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.820
we find that the threat from Jezebel

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.220
was that she was going to have Elijah killed

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.760
and by the way, she meant business.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.739
By the way, she's a wicked queen.

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.820
She had no problem with this.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.980
She had the power.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.260
She had the resources.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.019
We find that in just a little while

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:39.059
as you go through the book of 1 Kings

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.299
and you begin to think about a man by the name of Naboth

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:43.260
and Ahab was disappointed

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.299
because he wanted Naboth's vineyard

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:46.940
and he couldn't figure out how to get it

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.019
and Queen Jezebel is the one that devises the plan.

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.339
She's a wicked woman and she gives this threat.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.980
She says, I'm gonna have your life.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.579
I'm gonna have you put to death

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:00.019
and by the way, she says at the end of the verse,

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:03.779
by this time tomorrow and so it was an imminent threat.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.380
I mean, it was an immediate situation.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.339
It was something in which there was great urgency,

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:08.160
if you will.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.320
Now, I'm thankful this evening to be able to report

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.279
that I've never had a threat on my life.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:16.200
Amen, I hope that you too can be in the position

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.540
in your life where you can say

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.160
that I've never had a threat on my life

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.660
but we do know that there are some

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.480
that have had a threat placed upon their life.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.119
I do not pretend for any moment of time

00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:30.200
to understand what that would be like.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.760
I do not understand I could say

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.840
and you could say how you would respond

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.000
or react in a situation like that

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.840
but the reality is I've never been there

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.239
so I don't know, amen.

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:46.599
I see the courage of Elijah in chapter 17 and 18

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:49.039
and then I see the threat of Jezebel

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:54.039
to begin chapter 19 and I find that Jezebel's threat

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.919
is so significant and has such an impact

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:02.359
with regard to it being carried to Elijah

00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:06.000
that he immediately is going to depart.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.200
It was a real situation.

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:10.380
We find that as you look at the text,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.340
we notice the threat but I want you to notice number two,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.159
the trip.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.200
Beginning in verse number three

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.919
and down through verse number 14,

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:20.299
we see this trip that Elijah takes.

00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:22.919
Notice the Bible says and when he saw that,

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.320
he arose and went for his life.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.799
And he came to Beersheba which belongeth to Judah

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.840
and left his servant there.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.539
As we begin to think about this,

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:34.000
I want you to think about the life of Elijah

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:36.080
and I want you to think about when he stood there

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.440
before Ahab in chapter number 17 and verse number one

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.559
and he delivered that declaration,

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:46.159
a 25-word declaration with regard to the judgment of God

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:50.440
on the house of Israel and we find that after that,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.640
the word of the Lord came to Elijah

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.400
and told Elijah where to go.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.219
Where was it that he was to go immediately?

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:58.080
The brook Cherith.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.580
And you read that, God was giving clear direction.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.780
and we find that God says, go to Cherith,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.340
and he goes to Cherith, and what happens at Cherith?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.240
Well, the water dries up, why?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240
Because there's a drought.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.360
Now, by the way, God knew that that would happen.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.140
God knows everything.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.780
But we find that then God speaks to him

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.960
and says, go to Zarephath.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.540
Do you find in chapter 17

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.200
how God is providing the leadership, the direction?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.140
You know what you miss in chapter 19?

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.100
You miss anywhere where God comes to Elijah and says,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.100
go, depart, go to this place, you don't see it.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.620
You see that Elijah, because of the threat

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.380
that's been made in verse number two,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.380
he hears that, he sees that, he's aware of that,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.420
and he rises up and he goes for his life.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.060
The Bible says that he comes to Beersheba,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.800
which belongeth to Judah, and he left his servant there,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.340
but verse four says, but he himself went a day's journey

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.700
into the wilderness, and he came and sat down

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.320
under a juniper tree, and he requested for himself

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.580
that he might die.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.000
He said, it is enough.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.080
Now, O Lord, take away my life,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.320
for I am not better than my father's.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.880
This is a low point in the life of Elijah.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.040
I mean, this is a difficult,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.340
when you read through chapter 19,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.920
you say, what happened to the guy in chapter 17 and 18?

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.200
What's going on in the life of Elijah?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.400
And we find that he's dealing with this threat,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.640
but he takes this trip and he responds to the threat

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.240
by fleeing for safety.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.760
And we find that though we might understand

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.380
that Jezebel was not aware of his location,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.700
that Jezebel did not know where Elijah might be,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.160
I rejoice in this truth that God knew exactly

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.640
where his servant was.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.140
Jezebel put the threat on his life,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.000
but Jezebel had no means of knowing exactly

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.360
where Elijah had fled to, but God, all along the way,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.320
God knew his steps, God knew where he was,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.600
and God meets him.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.600
And I want you to see in verse number four,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.200
the Bible, verse number five, excuse me,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.840
it says, and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.680
behold, then an angel touched him

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.280
and said unto him, arise and eat.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.360
When I look at this trip,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.600
I want you to really notice two things

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.520
within this thought tonight of the trip that Elijah takes.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.100
I want you to first consider with me the provision of God.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.360
I'm so thankful that our God is the God who provides.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.480
In fact, that'll be one of the names of God

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.640
that we study on that Wednesday night series.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.120
He's the God who provides.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.480
And we begin to think about our lives

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.720
and we think about the provision,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.000
and so often, when we consider provision,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.640
yes, we think about the things that we need,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.160
but you understand that Jesus says twice,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.080
within just a few verses in the book of Matthew,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.280
that God already knows, our Father knows

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.960
what we have need of.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.880
We need not to be concerned of those things.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.200
God knows what we have need of.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.220
We understand that God is able to provide for us,

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.840
that God is able to meet your needs

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.600
and my needs and our needs,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.160
and we can rejoice in that,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.200
and we find that God is going to provide for his servant.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.760
Again, God knew exactly where Elijah was,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.920
and God sent an angel in verse number five,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.080
and that angel touched Elijah.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.800
When Elijah was in that low place,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.140
when Elijah said, take my life from me,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.160
when Elijah was in despair,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.120
God met him and God sent this angel

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.060
and said unto him, arise and eat.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.480
Notice verse six, and he looked,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.000
and behold, there was a cake baking on the coals,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.480
and a cruise of water at his head,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.040
and the Bible says that he didn't eat and drink

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.920
and laid him down again.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.680
I mean, I'd be absolutely astonished,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.560
and where'd that come from?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.480
What's going on?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.700
I mean, it's an amazing thing, is it not?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.720
The way that God supernaturally,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.680
miraculously provided for his servant.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.880
That's our God.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.480
That's who we serve.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.800
Our God is a real God.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.320
Our God is a God who is able.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.640
You say, but I don't see how.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.200
You don't have to see how,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.520
because God works in the impossible situations.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.680
Because when we look at it and we say,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.640
there's no hope, it's impossible,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.680
that's really the time in which God is ready to work.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.120
For with our God, nothing is impossible.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.480
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.880
We find this evening that he laid down again,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.400
according to the end of verse number six,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.560
and the angel of the Lord in verse seven

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.400
came again the second time and touched him

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.740
and said, arise and eat,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.440
because the journey is too great for thee.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.200
And he rose and did eat and drink

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.520
and went in the strength of that meat

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.920
40 days and 40 nights into Horeb, the mount of God.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.280
What a meal it must have been.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280
Amen?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.440
There is nothing that I have ever consumed

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.040
that kept me for 40 days and 40 nights.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.000
And I'm guessing it's not anything

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.080
that you've ever consumed either, amen?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.360
And the reality is that we ate lunch

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.260
and in a little while we'll be ready for dinner.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.300
And that's just how it works.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.080
And here we find that God provides.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.040
Just rejoice for a moment this evening that God provides.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.400
He's a good God.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.640
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.640
He leads us, He provides for us.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.240
As a good shepherd, the shepherd knows the needs

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.080
of the sheep.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.480
Our God knows what we need.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.760
And He provides what we need.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.120
It may not always be the way that we think

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.160
or what we might figure that it should be,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.160
but God always provides.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.640
He's a good God, He's a gracious God.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.600
But I notice in this trip that Elijah takes

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.000
when he's fleeing for his life

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.120
that there's not just the provision of God,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.640
but I also want us to consider this evening

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.780
the probing of God.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.620
The probing of God.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.880
Have you ever been asked a question

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.480
that's a probing question?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.540
A question that requires you to do some soul searching?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.640
In fact, I believe this evening that really

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.640
the question of that first song that we sang this evening

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.820
is such a question.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.940
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.640
Every time I sing that song, it convicts me.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.940
He is worthy of our best.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.000
Not just good enough, not just get by,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.900
but He's worthy of our best.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.660
We're working for the master, the king of the universe.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.500
And here, there's a probing question.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.900
We've used it for the title of our message this evening,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.060
but we find that in verse nine,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.100
the Bible says he came thither into a cave

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.260
and lodged there, and behold,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.820
the word of the Lord came to him,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.280
and he said unto him, what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.320
You understand how that's a probing question?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.220
Could I phrase it this way,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.820
maybe a way that we might use it today?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.020
What are you doing here?

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.140
What are you doing here?

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.140
Why are you here?

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.020
Elijah gives an answer in verse 10,

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.300
and he says this, I have been very jealous

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.780
for the Lord God of hosts,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.260
for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.320
They've thrown down thine altars

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.700
and slain thy prophets with the sword,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.140
and I, even I only, am left,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.920
and they seek my life to take it away.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.860
Elijah understood the circumstances,

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.620
the conditions in Israel,

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.300
and that which he was, and how he was serving the Lord.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.060
He was wrong on his assessment

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.820
that he was the only one remaining,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.700
and we'll see that at the end of the text,

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.520
but we find that he was, he gave an answer,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.700
but I wanna, I would submit to you this evening

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.680
that as you look at the continuation

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.160
of the text of Scripture,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.400
that it was probably not satisfactory.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.240
Why?

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.060
Because in verse number 11,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.900
the Bible says, and he said,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.340
go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord,

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.660
and behold, the Lord passed by in a great and strong wind,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.860
rent the mountains and break in pieces

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.420
the rocks before the Lord,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.860
but the Lord was not in the wind,

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.180
and after the wind, an earthquake,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.500
but the Lord was not in the earthquake,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.360
and after the earthquake, a fire,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.580
but the Lord was not in the fire,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.420
and after the fire,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.760
notice what it says, a still, small voice.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.980
We've often spoken about that still, small voice.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.500
We find that the Bible says that it was so

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.480
that when Elijah heard it,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.300
can I pause just for a moment and ask the question,

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.260
do you hear the voice of God?

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.560
I don't mean audibly,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.520
but I mean, do you hear from God when he's speaking to you?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.640
Do you have a ear that is sensitive

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.119
to the voice of the Lord?

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.440
You know, it's amazing how many times

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.340
throughout the Scriptures,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.760
you'll find the phraseology of hear.

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.900
Let him that hath ears hear.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.520
And we find this evening,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.600
the Bible says that when Elijah heard it,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.400
sometimes there's noise,

00:18:57.239 --> 00:18:59.960
just background noise, right?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.440
And it might not have your attention,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.440
but then you hear somebody's voice that you know,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.200
maybe your spouse, maybe a child,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.440
maybe a parent for a child.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.880
You hear that voice, and it gets your attention, why?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.280
Because you're sensitive to the voice of that individual.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.320
Does that make sense tonight?

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.280
We know the voices of people,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.140
no doubt this evening,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.619
if you were to be in a crowd of people,

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.340
and if you have a spouse here this evening,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.260
if you have a child here this evening,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.940
and you heard them call out,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.020
if you had a friend, a parent that you knew very well,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.179
and you heard them cry out your name,

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:40.220
you're familiar with their voice.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.500
You hear it.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.600
Listen, we ought to know the voice of God.

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.739
We ought to long to hear from God.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.940
We come to church,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.940
we don't come just for a social gathering.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.739
We read our Bibles on a daily basis,

00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:54.940
we don't just read our Bibles

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.940
to check a box in a Bible reading schedule plan, no.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.320
and we come to church so we can hear from God.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.780
Because this is the amazing thing,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.080
the God of the universe wants to talk to us.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.780
He has a message for us.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.860
Listen, of all the 7,000 that had not bowed the knee

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.240
according to what God said,

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.620
in this chapter, He's focused on one, Elijah.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.080
And He's speaking to one, Elijah.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.240
And what a joy to know that our God loves us

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.160
and He cares about us

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.840
and He wants to speak to us.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.040
And I wonder tonight, are we listening for the voice of God?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.280
Are we hearing the voice of God?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.160
Are we responding to the voice of God?

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.200
You ever find someone that's good at ignoring?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.000
I mean, like, you know they heard you.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.300
Men, oftentimes, we get accused of having selective hearing.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.720
Amen?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.240
He says he needs hearing aids.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.560
He don't need hearing aids, he just has selective hearing.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.080
He's not hard of hearing, he just has selective hearing.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.120
And all the women said, praise the Lord, Pastor,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.120
thank you for helping us out, amen?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.440
But the reality is that sometimes we have that select,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.120
listen, Nova is one.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.360
Can she ignore?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.080
Holy cow, that girl can ignore.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.080
You're like, hey, Nova, Nova.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.040
And man, she ain't paying no kind of attention to you.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.080
She can ignore you and ignore you.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.760
Listen, that's not how we should be with the voice of God.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.440
We ought to be sensitive.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.200
We ought to be ready to hear it,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.920
longing to hear the voice of God

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.760
and responding in obedience to the voice of God.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.400
It says when Elijah heard it,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.800
that he wrapped his face in his mantle

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.639
and he went out and stood in the entering of the cave.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.360
Some people are looking for some big things.

00:21:55.319 --> 00:22:00.319
The strong wind, the earthquake, and the fire,

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.800
they really didn't impact Elijah.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.639
We know the still, small voice of God.

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:07.800
It calls him to go out.

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:10.479
And he wrapped himself in his mantle

00:22:10.479 --> 00:22:12.320
and he went out and stood in the entering of the cave.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.639
And the Bible says,

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:16.199
behold, there came a voice unto him and said,

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:21.160
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.800
Now, if I could make the illustration this evening,

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.040
God is our heavenly father.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.919
Do we agree with that?

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:29.000
We are his children.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.600
If you're saved this evening, you're a child of God.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.279
You were born in the family of God

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:34.760
and he became our father.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.960
And what a joy that is.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.880
And I understand that as we study the scriptures

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.160
and we get the opportunity to see the truth

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.600
of how he deals with us as his children,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.320
he disciplines us and he corrects us.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.800
He loves us.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.080
There's so many things that he does.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.119
But I look at this passage of scripture

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:55.199
and I'm reminded of how a father might behave

00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:56.720
and interact with their children.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.320
Have you ever, maybe a parent,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.279
and I'll understand that God is our father,

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:03.040
but as a parent this evening,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.119
have you ever asked your child a question

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:06.639
and they gave you an answer,

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:08.320
but it wasn't the right answer?

00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:10.800
And so what did you do?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.919
You asked the question again, right?

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.000
And they look at you and they say,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.440
well, I already gave you an answer.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.400
Well, I'm asking you again

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.880
because obviously it wasn't the right answer, right?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.600
Are we tracking?

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.760
So what does God do?

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.600
God didn't change the question.

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:29.680
God asked the same question again.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.520
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.000
I believe tonight that Elijah could have slept

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.240
on the steps of the palace

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.960
and God could have spared his life.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.800
I believe that tonight.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.639
That's the God that we serve.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.600
Listen, I believe tonight that Abraham

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.919
didn't have to lie about Sarah being his sister.

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:56.360
I believe that Abraham could have went

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.960
right up into Egypt and said,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.279
she's my wife, what are you gonna do about it?

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.919
Why? Because I know God.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.199
I believe that.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.080
And I believe that Elijah could have slept

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.880
on the very steps of the palace of Jezebel

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.160
and God could have protected his servant.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.160
That's the God that we serve.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.119
He's able to exceeding abundantly

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:22.040
above all that we ask or think.

00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:25.600
And we find this evening that God says,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.760
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.360
Notice in verse 14, he said,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.720
I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.000
because the children of Israel

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.360
have forsaken thy covenant,

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.440
thrown down thine altars

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.360
and slain thy prophets with the sword

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.720
and I even I only am left

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.640
and they seek my life to take it away.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.519
Guess what? He gives the same answer.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.360
But here's what I love.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.279
God is patient.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.399
God is patient.

00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:52.200
God's far more patient than I am.

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:55.320
And he's far more patient than you are.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.799
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.279
We use the term long suffering

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:00.200
and I love the Bible term

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.399
that our God is a God who is long suffering.

00:25:03.399 --> 00:25:05.080
And our God is patient with us.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.600
Our God meets us where we are

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.679
and he helps to develop us to be what we ought to be.

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:12.839
I think about Gideon and when Gideon's faith was weak

00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:14.799
and he asked God for a sign,

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:17.040
guess what God did?

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.360
God gave him a sign.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.880
Isn't that gracious of God?

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.640
And after God gave him a sign, guess what?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.959
Gideon's faith still wasn't enough.

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.160
And so what does Gideon do?

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.880
He asked for another sign and what does God do?

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.279
God gives another sign.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.160
We serve a God who is so gracious.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.040
He's so loving.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.440
Listen, Elijah gave an answer to the question,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.839
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.160
And he gave a response and he gives the same response

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.200
to the question two times when we find that God,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.880
instead of going through and beating him over the head,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.880
we find that God responds in patient, loving kindness.

00:25:58.239 --> 00:25:59.799
Our God is so merciful.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.799
But I want you to understand this evening

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.760
that when we look at the trip of Elijah,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.040
when we look at his response to the threat

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.080
that was given to flee for his own safety,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.000
that in that time of fleeing,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.720
we still see the provision of God,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.480
but we see the probing of God.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.200
And this evening I'm focused on that thought

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.559
of the probing of God.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.000
What are we doing?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.959
Why are we here?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.399
What's the purpose?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.200
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.640
But in a real sense, each of us could put our name

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.640
in place of Elijah, and I wonder what our answer

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.600
would be to God.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.880
If God were to come down to you this evening

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.200
and say, what are you doing here?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.720
What would you say?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.040
What would your answer be?

00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:58.600
We find that God knows where we are.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.440
He knows why we're where we are.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.959
He knows where we're supposed to be.

00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:08.720
The question is, do we know why we are where we are?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.000
We notice in the next few verses of our text of Scripture,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.360
not only the trip, we see the threat, the trip,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.799
and then I want you to notice the task.

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:22.200
God reveals his plans for Elijah.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.760
There's a task that needs to be completed.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.279
According to verses 15 through 18,

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:29.799
there's three specific things that God reveals to Elijah.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:31.000
Notice it says in verse 15,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.559
and the Lord said unto him,

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:35.679
go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus,

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.239
and when thou comest, anoint Haziel to be king over Syria.

00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:43.000
Jehu, the son of Nimshi,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.200
shall thou anoint to be king over Israel,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.440
and Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.799
shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:54.880
And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.200
the sword of Haziel shall Jehu slay,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.760
and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.239
shall Elisha slay.

00:28:02.239 --> 00:28:07.239
In verses 15 and 16, God gives revelation to Elijah

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.600
with regard to the task that Elijah had,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.080
and the task was threefold.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.279
Number one, he was to anoint Haziel to be king of Syria,

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:18.279
according to verse number 15.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:20.600
He was to anoint Jehu to be the king of Israel,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.519
according to verse 16,

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:25.839
and Elisha to be the prophet in his place,

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:28.000
according to verse number 16.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.839
We find that as we look at this task that is given,

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:33.760
that even though Elisha says in the beginning of the text,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.359
when he first flees, he says, in verse number four,

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:38.440
that he requested for himself that he might die,

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.280
and said, it is enough now, O Lord,

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.940
take my life, for I am not better than my father's.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.440
Listen, God still had a plan for Elijah.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.080
God still had a task for Elijah to complete.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.559
There was still a work for Elijah to do,

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:53.359
and we find that in this position,

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:55.919
in this circumstance that Elijah finds himself,

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:58.799
we find that God, in his grace and his mercy,

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:01.280
he says, I have a task for you.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.359
In other words, when I'm asking you what you're doing here,

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:05.720
yes, there was a location where Elijah was,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.039
but Elijah was in a place

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:09.320
where he was not going to be able to fulfill

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.940
the task that God had for him.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.479
Notice what God says in beginning to reveal this task,

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:16.960
revealing the plan.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.640
He says, in verse number 15,

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.960
go return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.200
and he's gonna go and anoint Haziel to be king over Syria.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.559
He could not anoint Haziel, Jehu, or Elisha

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:33.400
from the place where he was.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.580
He was in the wrong place.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.440
He fled because of a threat,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.840
and because he fled, he took this trip,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.880
and he finds himself in this cave.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.880
He finds himself in this place of being in this location

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:51.859
where he's not going to be able to fulfill

00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:55.179
the task that God has for him.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.880
Where we are is important.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.680
Where we are is important.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.200
Someone said this to me last week,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.320
we were chatting on the phone,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.640
and they said, I know exactly why God has me

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.240
at the job where he has me,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.240
because there are people that need to hear the gospel,

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.280
and I've had so many opportunities.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.360
You know what that does to my heart?

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.380
It thrills my soul.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.220
Why?

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.680
Because that individual understands

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.120
that the job that they have

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.200
is more than just providing an income

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.840
or some level of benefits,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.040
that they have the perspective

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.060
that they're an ambassador of Christ in that place,

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.500
because where we are matters.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.860
And we find that this task that God had for Elijah

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.540
was specific in nature.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.180
There were three people that he was to anoint

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.860
to have positions in,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.440
the king of Syria, of Israel,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.220
and then Elisha to be a prophet in his room and his stead,

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.260
and we find that those were specific things,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.820
but I want you to understand tonight

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.400
that God has a task for us.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.060
God has a task for us.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.140
God has a work for us to do.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.580
How appropriate tonight.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.020
I had no idea what the songs were for tonight

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.180
until tonight,

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.300
because I saw the numbers,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.300
but I didn't know what the songs were,

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.460
and have I done my best for Jesus

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.020
and work for the night is coming.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.940
How appropriate that those two songs,

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.260
I feel like in my spirit tonight

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.740
that they blend so well with this text of scripture,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.380
because God has a task for us.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.580
But here's the thing.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.900
We can't allow the threats from others

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.820
to take us on a trip somewhere

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.820
that will keep us from fulfilling the task.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.580
That's exactly what the enemy wants to do.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.620
Elijah had an enemy named Jezebel.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.020
We have an enemy named Satan.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.420
And Satan will threaten us.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.260
It's the tactic that he used in the book of Acts.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.480
He used the religious leaders of the day

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.100
to threaten the disciples

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.820
of not speaking in the name of Jesus any longer.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.300
They bring these threats.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.140
Why?

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.980
Because they wanna shut us down.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.780
They wanna keep us from fulfilling

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.900
what God has called us to do.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.500
God's given us a task.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.100
What happens if we're not careful,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.500
that threat comes and we take a trip like Elijah did.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.980
We go someplace and in that place,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.460
we're not able to fulfill the task that God has for us.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.980
Tonight, God has a task for us.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.900
Individually and corporately as a church,

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.860
he has a task for us to complete.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.220
There's a work to be done.

00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:34.940
So we begin to think about this question this evening

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.220
as we kinda conclude here tonight.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.380
We think about this recurring question in 1 Kings 19.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.700
What doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.500
And I wonder tonight, if we were to be asked that question,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.700
how well we would be able to answer the question.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.700
I wonder tonight if we would have assurance

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.940
of being able to stand and say with absolute certainty

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.100
that I know that I'm in the place where God wants me to be,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.660
doing the work that God wants me to do,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.020
that I have that confidence, that assurance.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.340
I want you to think about Joseph

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.059
and use two examples tonight by way of closing.

00:33:08.059 --> 00:33:10.139
I want you to look back at Genesis chapter 45

00:33:10.139 --> 00:33:12.340
and many of us are familiar with the life of Joseph

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.100
and what a great life it is.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.419
Of course, not long ago, we finished up on Sunday nights

00:33:17.419 --> 00:33:19.860
looking and studying through the book of Genesis

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.860
and of course, the latter chapters

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.460
dealing specifically with the life of Joseph.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.059
We come to Genesis chapter 45 and this is the place

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:31.620
in which Joseph reveals his identity to his brethren.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.820
We find that his brothers have come,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.260
they're seeking sustenance

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.059
and he had made himself unknown to them

00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:40.300
and now he's revealed his identity.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.860
And in chapter number 45 in verse number seven,

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.820
after he revealed his identity

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.260
and he says they were troubled

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.100
according to verse number three at his presence

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.779
and he calls them close to him

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.940
and he begins to communicate with them

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.139
and he says in verse number seven,

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:57.040
notice what he says, and God sent me before you

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.620
to preserve you a posterity in the earth

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.779
and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:05.300
So, verse number eight, now it was not you

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.620
that sent me hither, but God

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.740
and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.980
and Lord of all his house and a ruler

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.020
throughout all the land of Egypt.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.940
See, sometimes what happens in life

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.339
is we don't really know why we're where we are

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:20.540
and then we don't finish and complete the task

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.940
that God has for us in that place.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.080
What if Joseph ended up in Egypt

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.980
and just decided that he'd have a pity party

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.459
for all of his days in Egypt

00:34:28.459 --> 00:34:30.260
and just lay around and do nothing

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.820
and just sulk and sorrow and woe is me

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.860
and it's not fair and everybody else is doing this

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.320
and I'm stuck with this.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.320
No, he said God is in control

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.279
and God sent me here.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.619
I don't believe that Joseph knew on the first day

00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:52.959
all that we know about the life of Joseph on this day.

00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:56.480
Joseph lived life day by day, just like we do

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.959
and Joseph had no idea that he would end up

00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:02.080
second in command, that he would have all of that,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.119
but you know what Joseph did?

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.320
He had his eyes on the Lord

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.600
and knew that God had a purpose

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.640
and God had a plan and he says to his brothers,

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.260
don't be afraid, God sent me here.

00:35:13.279 --> 00:35:15.360
He knew that he was there for a purpose.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.679
He knew that God was using him at that time

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.800
in chapter 50 after Jacob dies

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.520
and his brothers are concerned

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.279
that now Joseph would seek revenge

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:25.860
because now that dad is gone,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.200
there's no hope for us to be saved,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.480
to be delivered, that Joseph will get recompense

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.040
for what we did to him

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.239
because the brothers knew what they did was wrong

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:39.720
and they thought, well, so long as dad was alive

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.320
that their life was protected in some manner

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.520
and now that dad is gone, then our life is in jeopardy

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.839
and so they devised this story in Genesis 50

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:52.320
and I won't deal with all of it,

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.520
but they tell him, dad told us to tell you this

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.559
before he died, but notice as Joseph responds to that

00:35:57.559 --> 00:36:00.360
in verse number 19, he says that Joseph said unto them,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.399
fear not, for am I in the place of God,

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:04.459
but as for you, you thought evil against me,

00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:07.160
but God meant it unto good to bring to pass

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.480
as it is this day to save much people alive.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.679
You ever wonder the magnitude of the work

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:20.360
that Joseph did in Egypt?

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.779
I mean, literally scores of people,

00:36:24.779 --> 00:36:28.339
I can't even put the number of people's lives

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:33.339
that were spared because he was confident

00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:36.260
that he was where he was supposed to be for a reason.

00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:38.540
I want you to think about Mordecai,

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.540
turn to the book of Esther, if you will.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.980
Esther chapter number four.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.420
We know some things about the book of Esther.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.839
In fact, not long ago, we had a Bible quiz

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:54.679
on the book of Esther.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:57.420
Brother Jeff was teaching some Sunday school lessons

00:36:57.459 --> 00:36:58.820
on the book of Esther.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.739
It's a great book.

00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:02.260
I actually preached through the book several years ago.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.179
Our theme for that particular calendar year

00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:08.520
was from this verse, for such a time as this.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.100
I believe, Ronnie, you can correct me

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.980
because you know all of it, but I think it was 2016

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.459
that that was our theme for the calendar year.

00:37:16.459 --> 00:37:19.300
Ronnie tells me, he reminds me regularly, he quizzes me.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.540
He says, pastor, do you remember what the theme was in 2015?

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.380
I have no idea, but I have a record of it.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.619
I can go look, but I believe it was 2016

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:30.899
for such a time as this.

00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:32.300
I want you to understand there's some things

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.260
that take place in this particular book,

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.899
and of course, I cannot develop all of it for sake of time,

00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:41.660
but Mordecai had a perspective,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.580
and he has some correspondence in chapter number four

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.760
between him and Esther because of the threat

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.459
that's been given with regard to the Jewish people

00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:51.339
being annihilated, and of course,

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:53.220
Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people,

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.580
and all that was taking place,

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.459
and we find this correspondence comes back and forth,

00:37:57.459 --> 00:37:59.420
and verse number 12, I'll pick it up.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.339
They told to Mordecai Esther's words.

00:38:01.339 --> 00:38:03.899
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther,

00:38:03.899 --> 00:38:06.619
think not with thyself that thou shalt escape

00:38:06.619 --> 00:38:08.800
in the king's house more than all the Jews.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.179
In other words, he's saying to her,

00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:12.540
just because you're in that place

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.580
doesn't mean there's going to be safety there.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.779
Haman was a wicked man.

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:17.739
He wanted all the Jewish people killed,

00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:20.140
and of course, we understand the influence of Satan

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.220
in that situation to destroy the messianic line,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.700
and so on and so forth, but in verse 14, it says,

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.300
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.539
then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:32.840
to the Jews from another place.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.900
You know what Mordecai had?

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.700
He had confidence and faith that God would deliver them,

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.299
that God would raise up somebody,

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:40.340
but notice what he says,

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.419
but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed,

00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:45.220
and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.539
for such a time as this?

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.299
That you've come to the kingdom for such a time as this.

00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:57.020
You begin to think about the perspective of Mordecai

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.940
with regard to the subject that we're dealing with

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.700
from 1 Kings 19, when God says to Elijah,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.220
what doest thou hear, Elijah?

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.340
When we ask ourselves as if God were asking us tonight,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.380
what are we doing here?

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.500
I wonder tonight, do we have that perspective of Joseph,

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.460
that assurance that I know that I'm in the place

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.539
where God has me?

00:39:13.539 --> 00:39:15.419
Do we have the perspective of Mordecai

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:19.820
that God has me here for such a time as this?

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.500
You know, so often I hear people,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.900
and I don't mean to say anyone here specifically,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.179
there's no one that I have specifically in mind

00:39:27.179 --> 00:39:28.619
that's in the congregation this evening,

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:31.900
but I hear generally speaking in our world today

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.700
about how difficult the days are in which we're living,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.299
and I understand they're difficult days,

00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:41.099
but understand that God has us here for such a time as this.

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:42.780
I've heard people complaining about the day

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.660
in which we're living,

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.020
and they seem to wanna curse the day,

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.140
but the reality is that God has called us to be the light

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.179
in a dark, wicked world,

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:54.619
and we're here for such a time as this.

00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:57.099
And so we must be able to answer the question this evening,

00:39:57.099 --> 00:39:58.299
what are we doing here?

00:39:58.299 --> 00:40:05.879
here. I know that God words it, what doest thou hear, Elijah? But if I could say it this

00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:11.599
evening and I could ask us tonight by closing and beginning our invitation, what are we

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:18.519
doing here? I have asked myself that question so many times this week as God just arrested

00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:26.439
my attention on 1 Kings 19. It just caused me to really do some examination. What are

00:40:26.439 --> 00:40:33.719
we doing? What are we doing? Why does God have us here? If God was done with us, He'd

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:40.039
take us home. I believe that. I believe that if you're here tonight, if you're living and

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:45.039
breathing then God has a purpose for you. To boil this purpose down into one statement

00:40:45.039 --> 00:40:49.159
as I taught in our Sunday school class this morning, your purpose and my purpose in life

00:40:49.199 --> 00:40:57.039
is to bring glory to God. To bring glory to God. What are we doing? Are we bringing glory

00:40:57.039 --> 00:41:02.279
to God? I said this in the Sunday school class this morning. It's a marriage class. We're

00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:06.079
talking about the purpose in marriage and the purpose of our individual lives is to

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:11.359
bring glory to God as His people. But for those that are married, that individual responsibility

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:16.679
to bring glory to God doesn't cease when you join together, it's just doubled. Now as a

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:23.279
marriage, as a family, as a unit, we're to bring glory to God. You know the church has

00:41:23.279 --> 00:41:27.599
a responsibility to bring glory to God. But the church is not the building, it's the people

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:34.679
and the church can only bring glory to God if the people are bringing glory to God. Elijah's

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:41.159
asked a very probing question. Elijah gives, I believe, the wrong answer on two occasions.

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:48.519
I didn't read verse 18, but God says to him, I have 7,000 that have not bowed the knee.

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:54.839
Elijah thought he was the only one. God corrects him in verse 18. But I wonder tonight if we

00:41:54.839 --> 00:42:01.159
were to truly just examine ourselves and say, as if God were speaking to us, what am I doing

00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:07.919
here? What am I doing here? I know it's time to be done, but I asked a man a question several

00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:16.359
years ago. Their son came to our vacation Bible school, we were doing follow-up visits,

00:42:16.359 --> 00:42:23.279
and I sat in his living room, Holly was with me. As I chatted with that man, he shared

00:42:23.279 --> 00:42:29.479
a number of things with me. And he said, let me ask you this, if I could, 500 years from

00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:35.879
now, what's really going to matter? And he said, 500 years from now? I mean he was shocked

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:40.919
at the question. I used the number 500 years because the reality is that none of us are

00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:50.519
going to be around in 500 years. I would venture to say that most of us, unless we do something

00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:57.519
extraordinary, are not even going to be known in 500 years. Most people have a difficult

00:42:57.519 --> 00:43:06.919
time tracing their genealogy that far back. But what we do for Jesus is going to count.

00:43:06.919 --> 00:43:15.319
And we really got to know, why are we here? You know why we're here? To work for Jesus.

00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:21.599
To bring honor and glory to His name. To glorify Him. It doesn't mean that there's nothing

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:27.479
else that we do. It just means that all those other things are things that are working together

00:43:27.919 --> 00:43:35.879
to accomplish that purpose, that singular goal. What are we doing here? The right answer

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:43.039
is that we're here to bring honor and glory to God. In Elijah's life, he was in a place,

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:49.719
because he took a trip, because of a threat, that left him in a place where he could not

00:43:49.719 --> 00:43:59.359
fulfill the task that God had for him. He could not anoint Haziel, Jehu, and Elisha

00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:07.839
from that cave. He had to get out and he had to go so that he could fulfill the task that

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:17.279
God had for him. You know what he did? He went. And he did. And you can read, not in

00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:21.839
chapter 18, you can read of Elisha in the end of chapter 18, 19, excuse me. We can read

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:27.879
and you can see how God used Elijah to complete those three things. Because our God had a

00:44:27.879 --> 00:44:33.479
task for him. And when God's done with us, when our task is complete, guess what He'll

00:44:33.479 --> 00:44:36.799
do? He'll do the same thing He did in Elijah's life. Now we're probably not going to go up

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:42.359
with the chariot like He did, but we'll take our final breath here and enter into the presence

00:44:42.399 --> 00:44:47.519
of our Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. I

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:55.679
pray God that You would help us tonight. Thank You for working in my heart over these last

00:44:55.679 --> 00:45:03.279
several days from this portion of Scripture, challenging me. And Lord, I pray tonight that

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:12.039
in a very real way that You'd help each of us to truly examine ourselves, our lives.

00:45:12.039 --> 00:45:18.119
Lord, may I answer the question, what are we doing here? Am I bringing glory to Your

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:23.279
name? Am I fulfilling the task that You've left for me to do? And I pray that we'd be

00:45:23.279 --> 00:45:29.399
honest and humble this evening. I pray God that You'd stir us up. I pray that as we have

00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:36.799
that process of examination, that as You point things out in our lives that require adjustment,

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:42.079
Lord, I pray that You would help us to make the adjustments. Just as a pilot would have

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:48.759
to make adjustments for a smooth landing to avoid crash and burn. God, I pray that we

00:45:48.759 --> 00:45:55.159
would be sensitive and that we would make the adjustments so that we would be able to
