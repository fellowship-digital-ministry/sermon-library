1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,239
I'm thankful to have dual citizenship though. My citizenship is in heaven as well

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:08,119
Amen, and I am a pilgrim and a stranger in this land

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,439
And if you're saved you are as well and we are heaven-bound and what glory

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:19,079
That is but as far as our earthly citizenship, I am thankful to be an American

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,879
I am thankful for the freedoms that we enjoy but I want you to understand this morning that our freedoms are under attack

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,680
And I want you to understand this morning that there are many people even as we think about today and this weekend Memorial Day weekend

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,319
I had prepared this message early in the week Monday Tuesday

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,400
had finished up preparations for the message this morning due to knowing that the move was going to be at the end of the week and

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,919
All of that and I have in my notes. I wrote out on Tuesday

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,360
About the way in which many people in our society today. Look at this weekend this

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,000
Day as being nothing more than a long weekend as being nothing more

12
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,319
Than a day off a bank holiday if you will and in fact yesterday

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,680
The vice president of the United States of America said enjoy your long weekend and made no reference whatsoever

14
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,879
To Memorial Day now after a lot of backlash. She corrected it this morning

15
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,559
I'll give her credit for that and she sent out another tweet this morning thanking those that gave the ultimate

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Sacrifice of their lives for our freedom

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,379
But just about 20 miles from here or less than 20 miles in Georgetown area of DC

18
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,319
There was a fake petition going around this weekend to cancel Memorial Day

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,440
The reason that was cited is that it only celebrated American imperialism and

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,319
Then there were some that when they were asked if they wanted to sign the fake petition they said well

21
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,319
No, I still want my day off

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,599
Look it up it this happened. I

23
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,319
Had this stuff in my notes and then I saw some news feeds and I'm like man. I mean this what's going on

24
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,400
I am thankful for those

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
That gave the ultimate sacrifice

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,839
for us to enjoy the freedom to assemble

27
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:22,000
The freedoms that we have been afforded and I'm so I listen America's not perfect

28
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,559
There's no church. That's perfect. There's no individual. That's perfect

29
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm thankful that God and all of his perfection had a perfect plan to redeem mankind

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,000
And in that perfect plan he sent his son God in the flesh

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,759
To die on the cross of Calvary to pay for your sin and my sin and the sin of the world

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,919
He was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose in victory

33
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,800
Conquering sin death in the grave one day one glorious day

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,679
We'll go to be with him and it'll be perfect in heaven. I know that America's got problems. I understand

35
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:02,919
But I'm thankful for the heritage that we have it's under attack. No doubt and there are many people

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,440
Unfortunately, I remember some of the songs that we sang my country tis of thee this morning

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,639
I remember singing that when I was in public school as a child

38
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,759
I

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,399
Remember as a child having some understanding not only because my dad served in the military but understanding Memorial Day and its significance

40
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:27,160
Not just the start of the summer vacations and a long weekend and a trip to the beach

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but those that died

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
for our freedom and

43
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,160
This morning. I want to look at Psalm 103 and I understand that even

44
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:45,800
As we think about the holiday in our church on our calendar here in America and we think about this Memorial Day holiday and

45
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,919
Obviously, there are many memorials

46
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,960
I hope that many of you have had the opportunity to visit some of the more memorials that are not far from us

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,479
We're a unique location to be able to easily go and see some of those memorials and those memorials

48
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,440
Have been designed they've been set up with the purpose of preserving

49
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:07,839
the memory of a person or an event

50
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:13,080
And we find that these memorials really they're designed to be a reminder

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,480
you go and you walk down to some of these memorials and you are reminded of

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,880
Those that paid the ultimate price for our freedom

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
you go to the

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,480
Vietnam memorial to the wall down there and you see all of the names that are listed right and

55
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,640
it's a reminder for us as

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,959
We think about the rich heritage that we have as Americans

57
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,119
We understand this morning that as believers as followers of Jesus Christ

58
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,600
We have a rich heritage and and we find that throughout the Word of God

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,920
we have been given many references to memorials and to

60
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,959
Remembering and to beware lest thou forget

61
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:04,480
We find that the nation of Israel had been instructed to set up some memorials so they would remember in fact

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,959
The Passover was instituted to be observed annually so that they would remember how God delivered them from Egyptian bondage

63
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,959
So that would serve not only as a reminder

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,839
But that it would serve as a picture of Messiah who would one day come Christ our

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,079
Passover and take upon himself the sin of the world

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,920
We find that the nation of Israel as they would enter into the land of promise

67
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:37,040
After those wilderness wanderings as they would cross the Jordan that they had been instructed by God Almighty to set up

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,239
Memorials there was a memorial that was established in Gilgal

69
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:47,359
There was a memorial that was established and set up those twelve stones in the midst of the river and you understand that the instruction

70
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:53,359
That was given by God Almighty to Joshua and then to the children of Israel was to set up these memorials

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,440
So that in time to come when your children should ask what mean ye by these stones

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You have an opportunity to say let me tell you what God did let me tell you how God worked

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Let me tell you how we walked over that Jordan on dry ground

74
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
In fact, you may not be able to see it

75
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,959
But we set up a memorial right in the midst of the Jordan because that's where God let us cross over

76
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,000
We find that there are many references to

77
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:29,359
The children of Israel not only having memorials, but to be careful about not forgetting see as human beings we we forget things

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Sometimes we forget important things

79
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,519
Sometimes we forget those things that we say we're not gonna forget this

80
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,399
We're gonna do whatever we can do to ensure that we remember something

81
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,320
The children of Israel prior to entrance into the land of promise in Deuteronomy chapter number six, they were told this beware

82
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,839
Lest thou forget

83
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,119
the Lord

84
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,760
What was it that they were to be careful of?

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,239
Well, they were going to go into a land where they were going to enjoy

86
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,040
The fruit of the vineyards that they did not plant they were gonna live in houses that they did not build

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
God said when you experience all of that goodness

88
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,880
Beware lest thou forget the Lord

89
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,880
And you say oh, how could we forget the Lord?

90
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,679
You know that the nation of Israel the Bible says that they forgot God days without number

91
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,480
Book of Jeremiah

92
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,799
We find that the indictment against Jeremiah or against the the nation of Judah by Jeremiah

93
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:32,920
Of course from the Lord was that they had followed after idols

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,839
Why did they follow after idols because they had forgotten the Lord?

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,079
They forsook the Lord they forgot the Lord and this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture

96
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,239
we find that it's a psalm that's ascribed to David and

97
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:53,279
Here is we would look at this passage. The Bible says bless the Lord. Oh my soul and

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,320
All that is within me bless his holy name

99
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,480
Now when you read verse number one that does not seem like it does not sound like

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,040
That it's some little kind of just go through the motions, whatever. No, he's saying

101
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,559
God's been good to us

102
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:15,320
They were singing that song this morning about being saved. They've tasted, you know, David said in Psalm

103
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,920
34 taste and see that the Lord is good and he is good and

104
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,519
Here the psalmist mean you you look at the passion. He says bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me

105
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,840
Bless his holy name

106
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:39,080
Bless the Lord. Oh my soul notice verse 2 and forget not all

107
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,359
His benefits

108
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:49,280
This morning. I'm going to preach a message that I've simply entitled from verse number 2 forget not all his benefits

109
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,159
How is it that we as the people of God? How is it that we as human beings that?

110
00:08:55,719 --> 00:09:00,760
Often forget things how is it that we can forget not all his benefits?

111
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,679
What are some things that we can do as a nation as we've mentioned already?

112
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,880
We've established some memorials for the purpose of remembering

113
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:15,719
The nation of Israel they've established some memorials under the direction of God so that they would remember

114
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,320
Now we understand that as generations pass by

115
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,619
the knowledge of those things the remembrance of those things

116
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,659
Unfortunately can pass and

117
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,940
No longer be recognized by a new generation

118
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,520
The Lord's Supper table that sits before me this morning has this do in remembrance of me

119
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,619
first Corinthians chapter 3 11 for the church for us as New Testament believers

120
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:49,979
He's given us that that truth of observing the Lord's Supper that ordinance if you will

121
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:54,659
And it reminds us of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us

122
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,380
And it shows us what he did for us till he returns

123
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,320
What a blessing.

124
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
So forget not all his benefits.

125
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,320
I want to just look at a few things, we'll be in a few passages, turn to Psalm 68, just

126
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,120
several chapters back, if you will, Psalm 68, and I want you to notice verse 19.

127
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,600
If you're taking notes this morning, first we must recognize all his benefits.

128
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,840
Until we recognize all his benefits, we're in a position where when the psalmist says

129
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,880
forget not all of his benefits, I've not yet recognized them, so how am I not going to

130
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
forget them?

131
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,960
And so as we look at this passage in Psalm 68, verse number 19, I want you to be mindful

132
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
of the goodness of God.

133
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:48,920
Notice what the psalmist says, blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits,

134
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,880
even the God of our salvation, Selah.

135
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,520
As we look at this verse, we recognize all of his benefits, obviously the verse before

136
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,760
us does not list all of his benefits, all of his blessings, all of his goodness to us,

137
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,800
but we are mindful of God's goodness in our lives, and we notice the psalmist as he says

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,160
blessed be the Lord, I want you to think about the words that are used, he says who daily

139
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,280
loadeth me with benefits.

140
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,120
Aren't you thankful for the daily?

141
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,080
I mean every day, his mercies are new every morning, amen?

142
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,720
His compassions, they fail not.

143
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:37,000
And I am so thankful that every single day, my God blesses me, it says this, he daily

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
loadeth me.

145
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,120
I mean I'm not sure what your mind's eye sees when you read verses like this, when you consider

146
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,040
the verbiage that is given, but I see some, this loadeth, right, I mean this isn't just

147
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,080
a little bit of a blessing, this isn't just a little bit of a benefit, it's not just scarce,

148
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,920
it's a load, amen?

149
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,680
And you think about the imagery that is here throughout these verses, and when we consider

150
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,000
this morning, we recognize all of God's benefits to us.

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,440
And we find that those benefits are daily, and that those benefits are loaded, again,

152
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,080
it's not with, they're not scarce, they're not reserved for I don't have that many and

153
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,440
so I have to be careful how I give them out, no, it's an abundance, God's goodness and

154
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,360
God's grace, and he loads you today, and he'll load you again tomorrow, and he'll load you

155
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,160
again the next day, and the day after, isn't that wonderful?

156
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,279
And then the psalmist says this, even the God of our salvation, Selah, we find that

157
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,800
word throughout the book of Psalms.

158
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:06,440
Sometimes in our fast-paced culture that we live in, we don't have time for Selah, right?

159
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,160
We're fast-paced.

160
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,360
We get all kinds of things going on, we're just, get it done, get it done, what's next,

161
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:29,840
what's next, what's next, Selah, just stop and meditate, take it in, my God daily loadeth

162
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,360
me with benefits.

163
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
We have to recognize this truth.

164
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,160
We have to not only recognize all of his benefits, but if you take and turn to Psalm 103, the

165
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,160
passage that we started in, number two, we must rehearse all his benefits.

166
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,680
See it's important that we recognize his benefits, but as we recognize them, we must then rehearse

167
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
them.

168
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,240
What does it mean to rehearse them?

169
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,360
Let's talk about them, amen?

170
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,480
There's a song many years ago, I remember a college group, let's talk about Jesus.

171
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,440
And the king of kings is he, amen, he is, and it went through all sorts of attributes

172
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:18,959
of our God, and it was a wonderful song that would just remind you of how good God is.

173
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,279
We notice in Psalm 103 that the psalmist says, bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is

174
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:30,959
within me, bless his holy name, bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.

175
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,559
Well, how do I forget not?

176
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,239
You know, if we daily recognize that he loads us with benefits, and then we rehearse those

177
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:45,320
benefits, those blessings, it's not likely that you're going to forget them, right?

178
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Why?

179
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,880
Because you're rehearsing them.

180
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,480
What do you do to not forget something?

181
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,239
People have various things that they do, they, I try to be really good at not forgetting

182
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:02,720
people's names, and so what I will do is I'll try to associate their name with somebody

183
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,619
else that I know, that sort of thing.

184
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:10,100
When the Trejos came here, they have 11 children, and so I was trying to remember their names,

185
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
and so what did I do?

186
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I rehearsed them.

187
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,860
And then I'm like, man, I don't know who's next.

188
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,820
Armando has that problem, and they're his kids, amen?

189
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:26,619
And the reality is that I would sit with the kids, with Joseph and Brianna and Juliana,

190
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:28,200
and I'd say, okay, tell me if I'm right.

191
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,839
Did I not do this?

192
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,739
I'm not joking with y'all, I did it, I said, all right, Brianna, tell me if I'm right,

193
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:34,739
quiz me.

194
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,339
And I'd try to list them all, and they're like, no, no, you got those two wrong, right?

195
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,899
And so I rehearsed them.

196
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:48,700
We do that in life with various things, but I wonder this morning, how often are we rehearsing

197
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,899
the benefits?

198
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,580
Forget not all his benefits.

199
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,739
So if I'm going to forget not, I better start rehearsing.

200
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:01,940
I recognize them, until I recognize them, I can't rehearse them.

201
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,980
But I recognize his benefits, and then I rehearse his benefits.

202
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,100
In our passage of Scripture, there are at least seven benefits that the psalmist mentions

203
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,619
here in Psalm 103.

204
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:17,179
Notice with me, the first is forgiveness.

205
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,020
Oh, aren't you thankful for the forgiveness of God?

206
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:27,220
I'm so thankful that the Bible tells us that with thee, with the Lord, there is forgiveness.

207
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,220
I'm thankful that the Word of God declares that our God is ready to pardon, He is ready

208
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,300
to forgive.

209
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm thankful that the Word of God says that if we confess our sins, that He is faithful

210
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,339
and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

211
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,059
It's a wonderful thing to be forgiven.

212
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,140
Amen?

213
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,820
Notice what the psalmist says in verse number three, who redeemeth thy life from destruction,

214
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,540
who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies.

215
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,059
Notice in verse number ten, He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according

216
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,300
to our iniquities.

217
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,500
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear

218
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Him.

219
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,619
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.

220
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,020
Oh, the forgiveness of God.

221
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,059
Daily, being mindful of the fact that He has forgiven you.

222
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm thankful for that redemption, that one-time regeneration, the fact that we are redeemed

223
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,140
by the blood of the Lamb, and there is a day you must be born again.

224
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Amen?

225
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,100
There's a day that we're saved, but once you're saved, you don't automatically stop sinning.

226
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,860
Amen?

227
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,739
We're delivered at that moment from the penalty of sin.

228
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:48,380
The Word of God would teach us that at that moment, we're delivered from the power of

229
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,339
sin.

230
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:57,660
In that same passage in 1 John, the Bible says if you say you have no sin, the truth's

231
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
not in you.

232
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,540
You make God a liar.

233
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,860
And I'm thankful that every day that we can go to God and have forgiveness.

234
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,899
I understand being forgiven forever, having the penalty of my sin, being forgiven for

235
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,380
that and being heaven-bound.

236
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:24,339
But you know, daily, when that sin will hinder our fellowship with God, we go to God and

237
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,339
have forgiveness.

238
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:28,500
Notice number two, the provision of God.

239
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,020
Here, the psalmist again, he says, forget not all of his benefits, and then I believe

240
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,859
that he begins to rehearse several for us.

241
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,179
In verse number five, we notice the provision.

242
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,580
Notice this, who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed

243
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,059
like the eagles.

244
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,859
Hasn't God been good to us?

245
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,539
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

246
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:51,539
Amen?

247
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,260
We find that our God, His provision in our lives.

248
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,580
You think about the nation of Israel, how God miraculously provided for them.

249
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,739
I mean, as they had enjoyed manna in the morning, they were complaining in the afternoon that

250
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:08,099
we have no meat.

251
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,099
We hate this bread.

252
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,020
We loathe it, is what the Word of God says.

253
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,580
This we're back in Egypt, right, isn't that what they said?

254
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,059
See, God has been so good to us.

255
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:29,919
His provision is not just in, you know, food, but we're thankful for the food that He provides.

256
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,859
You think about the shelter and the raiment and all those things.

257
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:36,700
Remember there in Matthew chapter number six, as he goes through and he's teaching about

258
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,479
the provision, listen, God knows what you have need of.

259
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,179
It is He that has formed us and not we ourselves.

260
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:50,220
He made us as individual human beings that require some provision and He graciously provides

261
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
it.

262
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,179
He's been so good to us.

263
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,179
We see forgiveness.

264
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,179
We see provision.

265
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,419
Notice number three, deliverance in verse number six.

266
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:07,339
6, the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.

267
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,039
It says that the Lord is merciful in verse number 8, and gracious, slow to anger, plenteous

268
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,499
in mercy.

269
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:19,179
And we think about the way in which the Lord has provided deliverance, the nation of Israel

270
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:23,419
many times throughout the Psalms in particular, you'll find where the Bible talks about how

271
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,759
He was saved from His enemies.

272
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,739
He's not dealing with salvation as we would speak of redemption, but deliverance from

273
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:32,639
a particular situation.

274
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,339
And I'm thankful for God's deliverance in our lives.

275
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,839
We find that number 4, He speaks about direction.

276
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,599
Notice in verse number 7, He made known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children

277
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,599
of Israel.

278
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,519
You know, Moses was a faithful minister.

279
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,579
He was faithful to give the people of God the Word of God.

280
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,639
As God would speak to Moses, Moses would then speak to the people.

281
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:01,779
And as God would speak to Moses and then Moses to the people, you know what God was doing?

282
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,399
He was providing them with direction.

283
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,479
When I think about direction, I'm not just speaking about which way to go, though He

284
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,619
provided that direction as well.

285
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,819
Not only the way to travel when they would leave Egypt land, that God would provide them

286
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,819
with direction.

287
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,339
The Bible says that God led them, not this way, not that way, but God led them this way

288
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:27,619
exactly where they were supposed to go so that they could see the power of God.

289
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,859
But I think about His direction in providing us with the Word of God.

290
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,899
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, a light to my path.

291
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,619
The Bible provides direction for daily living.

292
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,219
How is it that we could know how to please a holy God?

293
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:49,099
How is it that we could know how to approach a holy God?

294
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,419
He's given us direction in His Word.

295
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:54,099
Oh, I'm so thankful.

296
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:58,259
You ever try to put something together without directions?

297
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,619
Sometimes we as men are guilty of saying, I don't need those directions, right?

298
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,099
And then all of a sudden when you're halfway through and it's not going together right,

299
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,019
you say, hey, hey, hey, Joseph, go get those directions.

300
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,899
I think we're going to need those.

301
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:14,579
Well, the Word of God is our direction manual.

302
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,099
I don't mean to use that in a disrespectful way.

303
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:24,219
I don't mean to be irreverent, but it does provide us direction for living.

304
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,259
What do I do? How do I do?

305
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,979
See, so many people want to look at this book as just being a book of rules,

306
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:33,299
of do's and don'ts, and they want to criticize this book,

307
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,939
but I'm thankful that God gave us this book.

308
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:41,299
Because when He says, don't do this because this is going to bring judgment,

309
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,339
I'm thankful that He revealed that to me instead of just letting me be judged.

310
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,939
Right? Praise God.

311
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:53,459
Number five, notice verse eight.

312
00:22:53,459 --> 00:23:04,859
The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy.

313
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:09,099
Here in one verse of Scripture, we see the mercy, the grace of God.

314
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:15,459
We see His long-suffering, His slow to anger, His loving kindness toward us.

315
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,339
Oh, I'm so thankful for who God is.

316
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:22,859
I'm so thankful for His attributes that have been revealed to us in His Word.

317
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,419
And I understand that His attributes go much further than just verse number eight,

318
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,779
but as the psalmist is rehearsing some of these benefits,

319
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:32,259
remember, he says, forget not all of His benefits,

320
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,339
we recognize that He daily loatheth us with benefits.

321
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:38,139
And then we rehearse those things.

322
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:41,979
And he's saying, I'm thankful for who God is.

323
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,339
He's the Lord God Almighty.

324
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,499
He's merciful, He's gracious, He's slow to anger.

325
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,539
He's patient and long-suffering toward us.

326
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,899
Aren't you thankful for that?

327
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:59,139
Number six, I believe.

328
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:00,619
Compassionate.

329
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,379
Notice verse 13.

330
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:10,859
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.

331
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,659
For He knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust.

332
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:21,579
As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower the field, so he flourisheth.

333
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:25,339
Verse 16, for the wind passeth over it and it is gone.

334
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,859
And the place thereof shall know it no more.

335
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,579
Notice in verse number 13, the Bible uses the word pitieth twice.

336
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:38,339
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.

337
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:44,299
This word pitieth means to love deeply, to be compassionate, to have tender affection

338
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,299
toward.

339
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,419
Oh, I'm thankful for God's compassion.

340
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,419
The Bible tells us that He's compassionate, the Bible tells us that He's full of compassion,

341
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,859
that His compassions fail not.

342
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:59,419
The Bible tells us of the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry that He was moved

343
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,139
with compassion.

344
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:07,899
I'm thankful for the truth in verse number 14, for He knoweth our frame.

345
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:10,619
He remembereth that we are dust.

346
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:16,579
Listen, there are times in which as human beings we just are, we find ourselves in a

347
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:20,179
position where we say, we just don't know what to do, we don't know where to go, we

348
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:23,419
don't know up from down, left from right, so on and so forth.

349
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,779
And God made us, He formed us, He knows that.

350
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,579
He knows our frame.

351
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:32,819
And He graciously meets our needs.

352
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:38,539
I believe that as we look at a verse like verse number 14, and He says He remembereth

353
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:44,539
that we are dust, of course a reference back to creation, and you'd be mindful of understanding

354
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:49,339
that without Him, we can do nothing.

355
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,299
He is the vine.

356
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,619
We are the branches.

357
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,259
We must abide in Him.

358
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,499
He knows our frame.

359
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:02,539
Listen, that problem that you have, that difficulty that you're dealing with, that emotional whatever

360
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:08,539
that's going on, and you're struggling, God made you.

361
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:09,539
And He knows you.

362
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,779
And He's compassionate.

363
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:20,899
Number seven, if you skip down to verse number 19, He rules and He reigns.

364
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:28,579
The Bible says, the Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom ruleth

365
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:31,899
over all.

366
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:36,459
And we live in a day like today, and it seems like things are so confusing, and there's

367
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:43,939
chaos that is just seeming to reign, and man, every day the headlines change, and we just

368
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:49,939
rest in knowing that our God, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

369
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:52,939
He rules and He reigns.

370
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:56,619
He's never been defeated, and He never will be.

371
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,659
You say, well what's going on?

372
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,219
God's in control.

373
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:05,139
I may not know everything, but I do understand that He's long-suffering, and sometimes He's

374
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:07,579
long-suffering to people.

375
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:12,459
When He's long-suffering to somebody else, we're like, come on, let's get going here.

376
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:18,979
But in my life, when I want God to be long-suffering, I want Him to be long-suffering, right?

377
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:23,579
God's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

378
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:28,459
Listen, I know that Jesus is coming back, and I pray that He comes back soon.

379
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:34,059
But you know, there are billions of people in our world that are lost, and He's not willing

380
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,239
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

381
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,539
His timeline is perfect.

382
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,539
I don't know when He's going to return, but I know He rules and He reigns.

383
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:48,659
When you see people that shake their fist at God, when you see people that act as if

384
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,179
they're the ones that are in control, just remind yourself of what Pilate said to Jesus.

385
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,139
And Pilate said, don't you know that I have power to release you?

386
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,379
Or I have power to crucify you?

387
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,899
And what did Jesus say?

388
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,919
In a meek kind of response, He said, don't you understand that the only power you have

389
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,499
is the power I give you?

390
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,339
Amen!

391
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:16,939
The Proverbs, the wise man Solomon said that the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.

392
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:22,259
On Wednesday evening, Brother Maldolph preached from the book of Nehemiah, and he said, which

393
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,259
brother are you?

394
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:27,619
And he spoke of Nehemiah and Hanani, but you understand that in the preliminaries of that

395
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:32,539
message he shared with us how that God moved in the heart of Cyrus to have the people of

396
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:37,299
God return, that were in captivity.

397
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:46,619
Cyrus was His servant, He's the king, but God is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

398
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:52,859
I look at Psalm 103, and I know we didn't exhaustively study this passage this morning,

399
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,700
but we find that the psalmist begins with this heart of praise, and it's passionate

400
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,380
praise.

401
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,139
It's bless the Lord, O my soul, in all that is within me.

402
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:07,179
Bless His holy name.

403
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:12,539
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.

404
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,539
How am I going to not forget?

405
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,019
Rehearse them.

406
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:22,940
We recognize that He daily loadeth us with benefits, and then we rehearse those benefits.

407
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,059
At least seven.

408
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,419
You study Psalm 103, you might find more.

409
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,299
I kind of coupled several together in verse number eight, when I spoke about who God is.

410
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,519
But I'm going to tell you, the songwriter said, count your blessings, name them one

411
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,059
by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

412
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:50,299
I wonder, when's the last time you were struggling, dealing with just living in this world?

413
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:55,219
And instead of complaining and murmuring, and woe is me, and I don't know what's going

414
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:59,139
on, just take out a sheet of paper and just start writing down the blessings of God.

415
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:06,519
one by one. One by one. See how many sheets you can fill up. See how far you

416
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:14,499
can get. I mean, we can spend much time just praising God for who He is. Being

417
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:20,859
mindful of His wonderful attributes. The psalmist in Psalm 150 made that clear

418
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,899
that we are to praise God not only for the things that He does, but we're to

419
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:28,659
praise God for who He is. I've said many times over the years that when we learn

420
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,019
to praise God for who He is, we will never lack reason to rejoice because He

421
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,259
never changes. He's immutable. And so when you begin to fill up your prayer time

422
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,499
with praise and you begin to start that time of prayer by praising God for who

423
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:46,179
He is, you're always going to have reason to rejoice. God, I don't understand this

424
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:51,099
situation I'm in, but I understand who you are. I don't know how you're gonna

425
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,379
deal with this, but I know that you have a plan. This surprised me, but it didn't

426
00:30:55,379 --> 00:31:00,539
surprise you. Aren't you thankful for that? Have you ever been caught off guard?

427
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:05,539
You ever been surprised? Blindsided, if you will? You say, man, I didn't see that

428
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:11,219
coming. Listen, as vigilant as we try to be as human beings, there are times in

429
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:16,579
which we get blindsided. Because we're not omniscient. We don't know all things.

430
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:21,299
We're not eternal in the same sense that God is of being

431
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,499
outside of time and seeing the end from the beginning. There are times in which

432
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:28,419
things happen in our life we say, I didn't see that coming. I didn't

433
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,739
expect that. But when we know who God is, we can rest in knowing that it didn't

434
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:45,859
surprise Him. God has never said, I didn't see that coming. Never. Jesus Christ is

435
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:49,779
the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world. Before Adam and

436
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,539
Eve ever sinned in the garden, God knew they were going to sin and God provided

437
00:31:53,539 --> 00:32:01,299
a way. Because our God is outside of time. He is Alpha and Omega. He has no beginning,

438
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:07,939
no ending. And He has never been caught off guard. See, the psalmist is rehearsing

439
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:14,659
the benefits. We recognize, we rehearse them. I'd ask this question, how is it

440
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:19,119
that we should, number three, what is our response to all His benefits? Well, we see

441
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:25,319
it in this passage. The response is one of rejoicing, of praise. The response is

442
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,479
one of just, just bless the Lord. He says, all that is within me, bless His holy

443
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:38,199
name. Notice what the psalmist says. Turn over to Psalm 116, if you will. Another

444
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:43,119
psalm here, and much praise is mentioned here. Again, if we were to take the time to

445
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,199
read through the entirety of the psalm, you would see that there are many

446
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:51,919
references here with regard to the blessings, the benefits of the Lord, who

447
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:59,519
He is, what He does. The Bible speaks of, in Psalm 116 and verse 15, precious in

448
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,839
the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. Why? As we understand the

449
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,039
whole, the entirety of the Bible, to be absent from the body is to be present with

450
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,679
the Lord. But I want you to notice the question that the psalmist asks in verse

451
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:23,239
number 12. What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me? What

452
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:29,599
is it that I shall render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me? We once

453
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,279
again see this phrase, all His benefits. Remember, the psalmist said in Psalm 103

454
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,359
and verse 2, forget not all His benefits. Here he says, what is it that I shall

455
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,959
render unto the Lord for all His benefits? The psalmist said in Psalm 68, he did not

456
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:51,919
use that phrase, but he said, He daily loadeth us with benefits. And so here, the

457
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,119
psalmist asks an appropriate question, but you understand that in asking this

458
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,439
question, it's not as if we owe God something as far as, you did this for me

459
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:06,959
and so I have to pay you back with something. It's not really the idea. The

460
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:11,559
idea is that when I recognize all of His benefits and I rehearse all of His

461
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,279
benefits, my response is going to be one of praise and thanksgiving. My response

462
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:21,479
is going to be one of a life of surrender, that I recognize all that

463
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:26,079
He has done for me and I've daily rehearsed. And so we sing the song about

464
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,279
living for Jesus. Why? Because of all that He's done for me, because of all that He

465
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:38,919
is. Notice in verse number 17 of this passage here in Psalm 116, it says, I will

466
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:44,079
offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name

467
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,239
of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all those

468
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,279
people. Notice verse 19, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O

469
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:57,919
Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord. Psalm 117 is a very short psalm, two verses, but

470
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:03,119
notice these two verses in Psalm 117, O praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise

471
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,119
Him, all ye people, for His merciful kindness is great toward us and the

472
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,679
truth of the Lord endureth forever. Praise ye the Lord. We're living in the

473
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:23,559
midst of a time where people have said, what is truth? You can't know truth. Truth

474
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:33,759
is relative. Your truth, my truth, their truth. Nonsense. Truth is truth. Jesus

475
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:39,439
Christ said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father

476
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:46,359
but by me. His truth endureth forever. Aren't you thankful for that? You

477
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,119
understand the truth is constantly under attack, though. Why? Because Satan's a

478
00:35:51,119 --> 00:36:01,079
liar. And so truth is constantly under attack, but truth endures because God

479
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:08,919
said it would. Begin to think about our response, the response of praise and

480
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:13,439
thanksgiving. We're mindful of the truth in 1 Thessalonians, turn of the New

481
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:17,479
Testament, if you will, in chapter number 5 of the book of 1 Thessalonians, and

482
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:25,119
it's a familiar verse of Scripture to us, but as we consider this morning, this

483
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,559
thought of the psalmist in Psalm 103, forget not all his benefits, I've

484
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:38,679
recognized them, I've rehearsed them, and what's my response? In verse 18, notice

485
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,999
with me in verse 16, it says, rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In

486
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:53,559
everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning

487
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:59,999
you. I believe this morning that our response as the people of God to all of

488
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:08,199
his benefits is one of rejoicing, one of praise. Our God is worthy. The word

489
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,719
worship in our English language, it originally carried with it the idea of

490
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:22,719
worthship. He is worthy of our praise. He is worthy of our thanksgiving. And this

491
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,879
morning, as we would notice some parallels perhaps as I began the

492
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,959
meeting this morning and the introduction, if you will, to the message

493
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,639
with speaking about some of the sad realities of what we're living in in

494
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:43,479
2021 with regard to our nation and our heritage. And the fact that there's a

495
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:48,879
generation today that would literally sign a petition to get rid of a holiday

496
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:58,439
that exists because of the sacrifice of those that preserve the freedom

497
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:05,079
that we enjoy. And they're just clueless. That's probably the best word to think

498
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,159
of. They're clueless. In fact, and I don't know, I'm just gonna share what the

499
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:16,799
article said about this fake petition. I've never seen the movie Frozen, but

500
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,359
some of you have. The guy that was writing the article said that he's a

501
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,799
Marine but he has a daughter and he's watched Frozen too many times. But

502
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:29,399
evidently there's a snowman in that movie. Is that true? Come on, somebody

503
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:33,119
help me out. I know somebody's seen Frozen, right? Okay, there's a snowman,

504
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,479
Olaf or something like this, right? And he's singing a song about looking

505
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:45,079
forward to the summer. Is this true? Okay, now how stupid is that? That a snowman

506
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,879
is looking forward to the summer. He ain't gonna exist anymore. That was the

507
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,599
parallel that the person that wrote the article about these people signing this

508
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,159
fake petition. I thought, man, now you confirmed that that story is true

509
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,319
about Frozen. I'd never seen the movie. I think my kids were a little bit too

510
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,019
old when Frozen came out that I didn't have to sit there and watch it. But the

511
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:17,439
reality is that, listen, the same things happened in the Church of God. There's a

512
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:25,319
generation that has raised up that has forgotten all of his benefits. Listen, I'm

513
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,359
saddened at the state of our country that there are young people that do not

514
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,599
recognize the the ultimate price that was paid for the freedom that they

515
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:45,239
enjoy. I'm saddened by that. Breaks my heart. But as the Church of God, there are

516
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:53,799
some young people that were raised in church that are no longer in church.

517
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:58,919
They've walked away. They've turned their back.

518
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:03,099
They've forgotten the Lord.

519
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,719
Is that not sad to you?

520
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,719
Breaks my heart."

521
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,559
I said, what happened?

522
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,279
I don't know the answer to the question.

523
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:16,399
In fact, people that are much smarter than I am have written many books on it.

524
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:20,799
It's a problem that has been widely recognized in churches in America.

525
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:32,559
There's a poll that was recently taken that a high percentage of those within the Millennials

526
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:40,199
said they don't know and don't care if there even is a God.

527
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:45,159
But I just wonder sometimes about the state of the church.

528
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,039
We can see the state of our nation, it's sad.

529
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,039
Breaks our heart.

530
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:56,039
But what about the state of the church, that people could be raised up?

531
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,439
I mean, think about the nation of Israel.

532
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,439
Isn't that what happened with the nation of Israel?

533
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:04,079
Psalm, let's just think about Judges.

534
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,679
There was another generation that knew not the Lord.

535
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,679
What did they do?

536
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,679
They served Balaam.

537
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:16,599
Judges, go back and read it.

538
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:22,039
Generation that rose up after Joshua and all the elders, and they served Balaam.

539
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,199
Psalm 78 gives us the answer.

540
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:30,319
How is it that we ensure that a future generation would set their hope in God, not forsake God?

541
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,119
We have to rehearse His benefits.

542
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,279
We got to share with the generation, hey, our God is good.

543
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:40,119
Our God is real.

544
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,679
We got to have some memorials even as the people of God.

545
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:51,839
To come to this place where the psalmist says, forget not all His benefits.

546
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,879
I hope that the generation to come in our church, I hope that your children, that my

547
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:04,719
children, regularly hear us rehearsing the blessings of God.

548
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,839
That they regularly hear us talking about how good God is.

549
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:16,799
Listen, your kids don't need to hear you complaining about life and church and the

550
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,959
pastor's message.

551
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:22,399
No one would complain about that, I'm sure.

552
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:23,399
Amen.

553
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,919
Right, Armando?

554
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:29,759
But I'm just saying, what does that do?

555
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,519
What do you think that does to your children?

556
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,259
It doesn't help them.

557
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,039
It doesn't cause them to want to serve God.

558
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:43,159
It doesn't cause them to have that desire to go and do for the Lord all that He said

559
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,839
that we should do.

560
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,879
The Bible talks about, I believe it's in Psalm 106, I don't have it in my notes here, let

561
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:52,319
me just check to see if that's the right Psalm, and if not, we'll just keep on going forward.

562
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,039
I think it's in Psalm 106.

563
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:03,479
The Bible talks about here in Psalm 106 the way in which they talked and spoke badly about

564
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:08,879
the Lord and how they were doing that even within their tents.

565
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:14,759
And the reality is that they sang His praises, they believed, but then they soon forgot.

566
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,359
Look at verse number 13 of Psalm 106.

567
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,479
They soon forgot His works, they waited not for His counsel.

568
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:25,339
They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert.

569
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:30,439
He gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul in verse number 15.

570
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,839
It talks about the way in which they changed things in verse 21.

571
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,119
They forgot God their Savior which had done great things in Egypt.

572
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,679
Wow.

573
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,239
They despised the pleasant land.

574
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,939
They believed not His word in verse number 24.

575
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:45,359
Look at verse 25.

576
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,919
But murmured in their tents.

577
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:54,079
Now for them, what was their tent?

578
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,139
Their home, their dwelling place, right?

579
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:02,199
And they murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

580
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:06,579
What do you think their murmuring did to that next generation?

581
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,579
Further and further away.

582
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,859
I understand that we have problems and difficulties, but can we not recognize this morning that

583
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,539
our God is good?

584
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,179
I mean, through the storms He's good.

585
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,139
He's got a purpose and a plan.

586
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:23,619
And so what happens sometimes in our lives is when we're in the midst of the storm, we

587
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,259
begin to complain and murmur because we're in the midst of it.

588
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:28,779
We don't know all that God's doing.

589
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:33,779
Then we get through the storm and perhaps we've learned that lesson, that lesson that

590
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:36,099
could only be learned in that storm.

591
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:41,899
We say, oh God, thank you for teaching me that lesson.

592
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:49,499
And I wonder if we've murmured about the storm and our children heard that, did we go back

593
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:54,619
and say, hey listen, I know I complained about that storm, but man, God taught me something.

594
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:57,779
Can I share with you what God taught me?

595
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,979
I'm not suggesting that we completely erase from their minds that murmuring, but you know

596
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:06,859
there's some times in which we need to go back and say, listen, God's been good to us.

597
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:14,739
This morning, the state of our nation is sad, but I would say that the state of our church,

598
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:20,419
broadly speaking, there's a generation that has forgotten the Lord, just as there's a

599
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:28,659
generation that has forgotten the sacrifice of many to preserve the freedom in this nation.

600
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:36,379
And today, we're challenged by this thought of the psalmist, forget not all his benefits.

601
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:38,179
I need to recognize them.

602
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:42,379
Oh, he daily loadeth me with benefits.

603
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:43,899
God's been good.

604
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:47,619
Every day, God's been good.

605
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,979
And then we rehearse them.

606
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:49,979
Let's talk about the Lord.

607
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,979
Let's talk about what he's done.

608
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:57,419
Maybe we get around the table and, hey, share testimony, share a blessing, what did God

609
00:45:57,419 --> 00:45:58,419
do for you today?

610
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:02,339
How's God good to you today?

611
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:06,499
Because our response as we rehearse them, our response is one of, bless the Lord, oh

612
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:13,419
my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

613
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:18,099
Our God is worthy of our worship and our praise and our thanksgiving.

614
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:20,219
Forget not all his benefits.

615
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:21,219
Let's pray.

616
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,019
Father, we love you.

617
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:27,539
We thank you for loving us.

618
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:34,099
We readily acknowledge this morning that you've been good to us.

619
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:44,539
We agree with the psalmist that you have daily loadeth us with benefits.

620
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:50,859
The psalmist asked that question, what shall we render unto the Lord for all of his benefits?

621
00:46:50,859 --> 00:47:00,739
I believe an answer that is worth giving is one of praise and thanksgiving, adoration,

622
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:04,299
standing in awe of who you are.

623
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:12,939
God as we have seen in our nation, a generation that has risen up that has forgotten the sacrifice

624
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:22,899
of a former generation, I pray God that it would not be so in the church.

625
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:28,339
Not only would we be mindful of the freedoms that we have as Americans and the sacrifice

626
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:36,219
that was made to protect and preserve those freedoms, that we'd be mindful as the people

627
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:44,259
of God for all of your benefits, that our children, a generation to come, would set

628
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:52,379
their hope in God, they would serve you faithfully, they'd live for you.

629
00:47:52,379 --> 00:47:57,099
I'm not sure, Lord, how you've worked in hearts and lives today, but I pray that you'd help

630
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:01,459
us to respond, help us to just thank you.

631
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:08,659
Perhaps there's one that's not sure of heaven, whether here or watching live stream.

632
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:14,139
The group sang about being saved this morning, we spoke about forgiveness.

633
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:21,099
I pray God that you would help them today to understand their need for Christ.

634
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:25,859
For we as thy people, help us to rejoice in thee.

635
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,339
Well thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

636
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,779
Would you stand with me?

637
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:32,779
Eyes are bowed, eyes are closed.

638
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:35,700
Forget not all his benefits.

639
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,659
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.

640
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:42,859
Maybe you just need to come to the altar this morning and just rejoice for a little bit.

641
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:44,459
Just thank God for his benefits.

642
00:48:44,459 --> 00:48:47,940
Maybe as a family, right there in your pew, you just want to sit down or come to the altar

643
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,940
as a family and just say, let's thank God as a family for all his benefits, because

644
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,519
truly God has been good to us.

645
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:57,760
Forget not all his benefits.

646
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,399
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
