WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.239
I'm thankful to have dual citizenship though. My citizenship is in heaven as well

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:08.119
Amen, and I am a pilgrim and a stranger in this land

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.439
And if you're saved you are as well and we are heaven-bound and what glory

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.079
That is but as far as our earthly citizenship, I am thankful to be an American

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:25.879
I am thankful for the freedoms that we enjoy but I want you to understand this morning that our freedoms are under attack

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.680
And I want you to understand this morning that there are many people even as we think about today and this weekend Memorial Day weekend

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.319
I had prepared this message early in the week Monday Tuesday

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.400
had finished up preparations for the message this morning due to knowing that the move was going to be at the end of the week and

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.919
All of that and I have in my notes. I wrote out on Tuesday

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:55.360
About the way in which many people in our society today. Look at this weekend this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.000
Day as being nothing more than a long weekend as being nothing more

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.319
Than a day off a bank holiday if you will and in fact yesterday

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.680
The vice president of the United States of America said enjoy your long weekend and made no reference whatsoever

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:16.879
To Memorial Day now after a lot of backlash. She corrected it this morning

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:22.559
I'll give her credit for that and she sent out another tweet this morning thanking those that gave the ultimate

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680
Sacrifice of their lives for our freedom

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.379
But just about 20 miles from here or less than 20 miles in Georgetown area of DC

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.319
There was a fake petition going around this weekend to cancel Memorial Day

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.440
The reason that was cited is that it only celebrated American imperialism and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.319
Then there were some that when they were asked if they wanted to sign the fake petition they said well

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.319
No, I still want my day off

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.599
Look it up it this happened. I

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:05.319
Had this stuff in my notes and then I saw some news feeds and I'm like man. I mean this what's going on

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.400
I am thankful for those

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
That gave the ultimate sacrifice

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.839
for us to enjoy the freedom to assemble

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:22.000
The freedoms that we have been afforded and I'm so I listen America's not perfect

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.559
There's no church. That's perfect. There's no individual. That's perfect

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:30.960
I'm thankful that God and all of his perfection had a perfect plan to redeem mankind

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.000
And in that perfect plan he sent his son God in the flesh

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.759
To die on the cross of Calvary to pay for your sin and my sin and the sin of the world

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.919
He was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose in victory

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.800
Conquering sin death in the grave one day one glorious day

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.679
We'll go to be with him and it'll be perfect in heaven. I know that America's got problems. I understand

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:02.919
But I'm thankful for the heritage that we have it's under attack. No doubt and there are many people

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.440
Unfortunately, I remember some of the songs that we sang my country tis of thee this morning

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.639
I remember singing that when I was in public school as a child

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.759
I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.399
Remember as a child having some understanding not only because my dad served in the military but understanding Memorial Day and its significance

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:27.160
Not just the start of the summer vacations and a long weekend and a trip to the beach

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but those that died

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160
for our freedom and

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.160
This morning. I want to look at Psalm 103 and I understand that even

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:45.800
As we think about the holiday in our church on our calendar here in America and we think about this Memorial Day holiday and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.919
Obviously, there are many memorials

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.960
I hope that many of you have had the opportunity to visit some of the more memorials that are not far from us

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.479
We're a unique location to be able to easily go and see some of those memorials and those memorials

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.440
Have been designed they've been set up with the purpose of preserving

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.839
the memory of a person or an event

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.080
And we find that these memorials really they're designed to be a reminder

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.480
you go and you walk down to some of these memorials and you are reminded of

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.880
Those that paid the ultimate price for our freedom

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.880
you go to the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.480
Vietnam memorial to the wall down there and you see all of the names that are listed right and

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.640
it's a reminder for us as

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.959
We think about the rich heritage that we have as Americans

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:43.119
We understand this morning that as believers as followers of Jesus Christ

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:48.600
We have a rich heritage and and we find that throughout the Word of God

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.920
we have been given many references to memorials and to

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.959
Remembering and to beware lest thou forget

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:04.480
We find that the nation of Israel had been instructed to set up some memorials so they would remember in fact

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.959
The Passover was instituted to be observed annually so that they would remember how God delivered them from Egyptian bondage

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.959
So that would serve not only as a reminder

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.839
But that it would serve as a picture of Messiah who would one day come Christ our

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.079
Passover and take upon himself the sin of the world

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.920
We find that the nation of Israel as they would enter into the land of promise

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:37.040
After those wilderness wanderings as they would cross the Jordan that they had been instructed by God Almighty to set up

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.239
Memorials there was a memorial that was established in Gilgal

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:47.359
There was a memorial that was established and set up those twelve stones in the midst of the river and you understand that the instruction

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:53.359
That was given by God Almighty to Joshua and then to the children of Israel was to set up these memorials

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.440
So that in time to come when your children should ask what mean ye by these stones

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You have an opportunity to say let me tell you what God did let me tell you how God worked

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.720
Let me tell you how we walked over that Jordan on dry ground

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.440
In fact, you may not be able to see it

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.959
But we set up a memorial right in the midst of the Jordan because that's where God let us cross over

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.000
We find that there are many references to

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:29.359
The children of Israel not only having memorials, but to be careful about not forgetting see as human beings we we forget things

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.200
Sometimes we forget important things

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:38.519
Sometimes we forget those things that we say we're not gonna forget this

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.399
We're gonna do whatever we can do to ensure that we remember something

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.320
The children of Israel prior to entrance into the land of promise in Deuteronomy chapter number six, they were told this beware

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.839
Lest thou forget

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:55.119
the Lord

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.760
What was it that they were to be careful of?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.239
Well, they were going to go into a land where they were going to enjoy

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:06.040
The fruit of the vineyards that they did not plant they were gonna live in houses that they did not build

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.480
God said when you experience all of that goodness

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.880
Beware lest thou forget the Lord

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:15.880
And you say oh, how could we forget the Lord?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.679
You know that the nation of Israel the Bible says that they forgot God days without number

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.480
Book of Jeremiah

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.799
We find that the indictment against Jeremiah or against the the nation of Judah by Jeremiah

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:32.920
Of course from the Lord was that they had followed after idols

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.839
Why did they follow after idols because they had forgotten the Lord?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.079
They forsook the Lord they forgot the Lord and this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.239
we find that it's a psalm that's ascribed to David and

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:53.279
Here is we would look at this passage. The Bible says bless the Lord. Oh my soul and

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.320
All that is within me bless his holy name

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.480
Now when you read verse number one that does not seem like it does not sound like

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.040
That it's some little kind of just go through the motions, whatever. No, he's saying

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:10.559
God's been good to us

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:15.320
They were singing that song this morning about being saved. They've tasted, you know, David said in Psalm

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.920
34 taste and see that the Lord is good and he is good and

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.519
Here the psalmist mean you you look at the passion. He says bless the Lord. Oh my soul and all that is within me

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:32.840
Bless his holy name

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:39.080
Bless the Lord. Oh my soul notice verse 2 and forget not all

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.359
His benefits

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:49.280
This morning. I'm going to preach a message that I've simply entitled from verse number 2 forget not all his benefits

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:55.159
How is it that we as the people of God? How is it that we as human beings that?

00:08:55.719 --> 00:09:00.760
Often forget things how is it that we can forget not all his benefits?

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.679
What are some things that we can do as a nation as we've mentioned already?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:08.880
We've established some memorials for the purpose of remembering

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:15.719
The nation of Israel they've established some memorials under the direction of God so that they would remember

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.320
Now we understand that as generations pass by

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.619
the knowledge of those things the remembrance of those things

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.659
Unfortunately can pass and

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.940
No longer be recognized by a new generation

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:38.520
The Lord's Supper table that sits before me this morning has this do in remembrance of me

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.619
first Corinthians chapter 3 11 for the church for us as New Testament believers

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:49.979
He's given us that that truth of observing the Lord's Supper that ordinance if you will

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:54.659
And it reminds us of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:59.380
And it shows us what he did for us till he returns

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.320
What a blessing.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.440
So forget not all his benefits.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.320
I want to just look at a few things, we'll be in a few passages, turn to Psalm 68, just

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.120
several chapters back, if you will, Psalm 68, and I want you to notice verse 19.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.600
If you're taking notes this morning, first we must recognize all his benefits.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.840
Until we recognize all his benefits, we're in a position where when the psalmist says

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.880
forget not all of his benefits, I've not yet recognized them, so how am I not going to

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880
forget them?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.960
And so as we look at this passage in Psalm 68, verse number 19, I want you to be mindful

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.400
of the goodness of God.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:48.920
Notice what the psalmist says, blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.880
even the God of our salvation, Selah.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.520
As we look at this verse, we recognize all of his benefits, obviously the verse before

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.760
us does not list all of his benefits, all of his blessings, all of his goodness to us,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.800
but we are mindful of God's goodness in our lives, and we notice the psalmist as he says

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.160
blessed be the Lord, I want you to think about the words that are used, he says who daily

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.280
loadeth me with benefits.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.120
Aren't you thankful for the daily?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.080
I mean every day, his mercies are new every morning, amen?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.720
His compassions, they fail not.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:37.000
And I am so thankful that every single day, my God blesses me, it says this, he daily

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.920
loadeth me.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.120
I mean I'm not sure what your mind's eye sees when you read verses like this, when you consider

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:51.040
the verbiage that is given, but I see some, this loadeth, right, I mean this isn't just

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.080
a little bit of a blessing, this isn't just a little bit of a benefit, it's not just scarce,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.920
it's a load, amen?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.680
And you think about the imagery that is here throughout these verses, and when we consider

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.000
this morning, we recognize all of God's benefits to us.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.440
And we find that those benefits are daily, and that those benefits are loaded, again,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.080
it's not with, they're not scarce, they're not reserved for I don't have that many and

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.440
so I have to be careful how I give them out, no, it's an abundance, God's goodness and

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:37.360
God's grace, and he loads you today, and he'll load you again tomorrow, and he'll load you

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:44.160
again the next day, and the day after, isn't that wonderful?

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:52.279
And then the psalmist says this, even the God of our salvation, Selah, we find that

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:56.800
word throughout the book of Psalms.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:06.440
Sometimes in our fast-paced culture that we live in, we don't have time for Selah, right?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.160
We're fast-paced.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.360
We get all kinds of things going on, we're just, get it done, get it done, what's next,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:29.840
what's next, what's next, Selah, just stop and meditate, take it in, my God daily loadeth

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.360
me with benefits.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.320
We have to recognize this truth.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.160
We have to not only recognize all of his benefits, but if you take and turn to Psalm 103, the

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.160
passage that we started in, number two, we must rehearse all his benefits.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.680
See it's important that we recognize his benefits, but as we recognize them, we must then rehearse

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680
them.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.240
What does it mean to rehearse them?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.360
Let's talk about them, amen?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.480
There's a song many years ago, I remember a college group, let's talk about Jesus.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.440
And the king of kings is he, amen, he is, and it went through all sorts of attributes

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:18.959
of our God, and it was a wonderful song that would just remind you of how good God is.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:24.279
We notice in Psalm 103 that the psalmist says, bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:30.959
within me, bless his holy name, bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.559
Well, how do I forget not?

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:39.239
You know, if we daily recognize that he loads us with benefits, and then we rehearse those

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:45.320
benefits, those blessings, it's not likely that you're going to forget them, right?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320
Why?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.880
Because you're rehearsing them.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.480
What do you do to not forget something?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:57.239
People have various things that they do, they, I try to be really good at not forgetting

00:14:57.239 --> 00:15:02.720
people's names, and so what I will do is I'll try to associate their name with somebody

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.619
else that I know, that sort of thing.

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:10.100
When the Trejos came here, they have 11 children, and so I was trying to remember their names,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.100
and so what did I do?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100
I rehearsed them.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.860
And then I'm like, man, I don't know who's next.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.820
Armando has that problem, and they're his kids, amen?

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:26.619
And the reality is that I would sit with the kids, with Joseph and Brianna and Juliana,

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:28.200
and I'd say, okay, tell me if I'm right.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.839
Did I not do this?

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:33.739
I'm not joking with y'all, I did it, I said, all right, Brianna, tell me if I'm right,

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:34.739
quiz me.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.339
And I'd try to list them all, and they're like, no, no, you got those two wrong, right?

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:41.899
And so I rehearsed them.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:48.700
We do that in life with various things, but I wonder this morning, how often are we rehearsing

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.899
the benefits?

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.580
Forget not all his benefits.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.739
So if I'm going to forget not, I better start rehearsing.

00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:01.940
I recognize them, until I recognize them, I can't rehearse them.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.980
But I recognize his benefits, and then I rehearse his benefits.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:12.100
In our passage of Scripture, there are at least seven benefits that the psalmist mentions

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.619
here in Psalm 103.

00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:17.179
Notice with me, the first is forgiveness.

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:21.020
Oh, aren't you thankful for the forgiveness of God?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:27.220
I'm so thankful that the Bible tells us that with thee, with the Lord, there is forgiveness.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.220
I'm thankful that the Word of God declares that our God is ready to pardon, He is ready

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.300
to forgive.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.640
I'm thankful that the Word of God says that if we confess our sins, that He is faithful

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.339
and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:45.059
It's a wonderful thing to be forgiven.

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:47.140
Amen?

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.820
Notice what the psalmist says in verse number three, who redeemeth thy life from destruction,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.540
who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.059
Notice in verse number ten, He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:01.300
to our iniquities.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.500
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.500
Him.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:14.619
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:18.020
Oh, the forgiveness of God.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.059
Daily, being mindful of the fact that He has forgiven you.

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:29.700
I'm thankful for that redemption, that one-time regeneration, the fact that we are redeemed

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.140
by the blood of the Lamb, and there is a day you must be born again.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.140
Amen?

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.100
There's a day that we're saved, but once you're saved, you don't automatically stop sinning.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.860
Amen?

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.739
We're delivered at that moment from the penalty of sin.

00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:48.380
The Word of God would teach us that at that moment, we're delivered from the power of

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.339
sin.

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:57.660
In that same passage in 1 John, the Bible says if you say you have no sin, the truth's

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.660
not in you.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.540
You make God a liar.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:06.860
And I'm thankful that every day that we can go to God and have forgiveness.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:13.899
I understand being forgiven forever, having the penalty of my sin, being forgiven for

00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:15.380
that and being heaven-bound.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:24.339
But you know, daily, when that sin will hinder our fellowship with God, we go to God and

00:18:24.339 --> 00:18:25.339
have forgiveness.

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:28.500
Notice number two, the provision of God.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.020
Here, the psalmist again, he says, forget not all of his benefits, and then I believe

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.859
that he begins to rehearse several for us.

00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:37.179
In verse number five, we notice the provision.

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:42.580
Notice this, who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.059
like the eagles.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:46.859
Hasn't God been good to us?

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:50.539
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:51.539
Amen?

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:55.260
We find that our God, His provision in our lives.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.580
You think about the nation of Israel, how God miraculously provided for them.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:05.739
I mean, as they had enjoyed manna in the morning, they were complaining in the afternoon that

00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:08.099
we have no meat.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:11.099
We hate this bread.

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:15.020
We loathe it, is what the Word of God says.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.580
This we're back in Egypt, right, isn't that what they said?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.059
See, God has been so good to us.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:29.919
His provision is not just in, you know, food, but we're thankful for the food that He provides.

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.859
You think about the shelter and the raiment and all those things.

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:36.700
Remember there in Matthew chapter number six, as he goes through and he's teaching about

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.479
the provision, listen, God knows what you have need of.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.179
It is He that has formed us and not we ourselves.

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:50.220
He made us as individual human beings that require some provision and He graciously provides

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220
it.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.179
He's been so good to us.

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:55.179
We see forgiveness.

00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:56.179
We see provision.

00:19:56.179 --> 00:19:59.419
Notice number three, deliverance in verse number six.

00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:07.339
6, the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:12.039
It says that the Lord is merciful in verse number 8, and gracious, slow to anger, plenteous

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.499
in mercy.

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:19.179
And we think about the way in which the Lord has provided deliverance, the nation of Israel

00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:23.419
many times throughout the Psalms in particular, you'll find where the Bible talks about how

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:25.759
He was saved from His enemies.

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.739
He's not dealing with salvation as we would speak of redemption, but deliverance from

00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:32.639
a particular situation.

00:20:32.639 --> 00:20:36.339
And I'm thankful for God's deliverance in our lives.

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:39.839
We find that number 4, He speaks about direction.

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:44.599
Notice in verse number 7, He made known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:45.599
of Israel.

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:49.519
You know, Moses was a faithful minister.

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:53.579
He was faithful to give the people of God the Word of God.

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:57.639
As God would speak to Moses, Moses would then speak to the people.

00:20:57.639 --> 00:21:01.779
And as God would speak to Moses and then Moses to the people, you know what God was doing?

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:04.399
He was providing them with direction.

00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:08.479
When I think about direction, I'm not just speaking about which way to go, though He

00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:11.619
provided that direction as well.

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:16.819
Not only the way to travel when they would leave Egypt land, that God would provide them

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:17.819
with direction.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:22.339
The Bible says that God led them, not this way, not that way, but God led them this way

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:27.619
exactly where they were supposed to go so that they could see the power of God.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:32.859
But I think about His direction in providing us with the Word of God.

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:37.899
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, a light to my path.

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:41.619
The Bible provides direction for daily living.

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:45.219
How is it that we could know how to please a holy God?

00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:49.099
How is it that we could know how to approach a holy God?

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.419
He's given us direction in His Word.

00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:54.099
Oh, I'm so thankful.

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:58.259
You ever try to put something together without directions?

00:21:58.259 --> 00:22:02.619
Sometimes we as men are guilty of saying, I don't need those directions, right?

00:22:02.619 --> 00:22:06.099
And then all of a sudden when you're halfway through and it's not going together right,

00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:09.019
you say, hey, hey, hey, Joseph, go get those directions.

00:22:09.019 --> 00:22:10.899
I think we're going to need those.

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:14.579
Well, the Word of God is our direction manual.

00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:18.099
I don't mean to use that in a disrespectful way.

00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:24.219
I don't mean to be irreverent, but it does provide us direction for living.

00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:26.259
What do I do? How do I do?

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:29.979
See, so many people want to look at this book as just being a book of rules,

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:33.299
of do's and don'ts, and they want to criticize this book,

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:36.939
but I'm thankful that God gave us this book.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:41.299
Because when He says, don't do this because this is going to bring judgment,

00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:46.339
I'm thankful that He revealed that to me instead of just letting me be judged.

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:48.939
Right? Praise God.

00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:53.459
Number five, notice verse eight.

00:22:53.459 --> 00:23:04.859
The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy.

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:09.099
Here in one verse of Scripture, we see the mercy, the grace of God.

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:15.459
We see His long-suffering, His slow to anger, His loving kindness toward us.

00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:19.339
Oh, I'm so thankful for who God is.

00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:22.859
I'm so thankful for His attributes that have been revealed to us in His Word.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:26.419
And I understand that His attributes go much further than just verse number eight,

00:23:26.419 --> 00:23:29.779
but as the psalmist is rehearsing some of these benefits,

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:32.259
remember, he says, forget not all of His benefits,

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:35.339
we recognize that He daily loatheth us with benefits.

00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:38.139
And then we rehearse those things.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:41.979
And he's saying, I'm thankful for who God is.

00:23:41.979 --> 00:23:44.339
He's the Lord God Almighty.

00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:49.499
He's merciful, He's gracious, He's slow to anger.

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:51.539
He's patient and long-suffering toward us.

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:54.899
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:23:54.899 --> 00:23:59.139
Number six, I believe.

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:00.619
Compassionate.

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:03.379
Notice verse 13.

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:10.859
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.

00:24:10.899 --> 00:24:15.659
For He knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust.

00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:21.579
As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower the field, so he flourisheth.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:25.339
Verse 16, for the wind passeth over it and it is gone.

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:28.859
And the place thereof shall know it no more.

00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:33.579
Notice in verse number 13, the Bible uses the word pitieth twice.

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:38.339
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.

00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:44.299
This word pitieth means to love deeply, to be compassionate, to have tender affection

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.299
toward.

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:49.419
Oh, I'm thankful for God's compassion.

00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:53.419
The Bible tells us that He's compassionate, the Bible tells us that He's full of compassion,

00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:54.859
that His compassions fail not.

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:59.419
The Bible tells us of the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry that He was moved

00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:02.139
with compassion.

00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:07.899
I'm thankful for the truth in verse number 14, for He knoweth our frame.

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:10.619
He remembereth that we are dust.

00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:16.579
Listen, there are times in which as human beings we just are, we find ourselves in a

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:20.179
position where we say, we just don't know what to do, we don't know where to go, we

00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:23.419
don't know up from down, left from right, so on and so forth.

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:26.779
And God made us, He formed us, He knows that.

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:28.579
He knows our frame.

00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:32.819
And He graciously meets our needs.

00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:38.539
I believe that as we look at a verse like verse number 14, and He says He remembereth

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:44.539
that we are dust, of course a reference back to creation, and you'd be mindful of understanding

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:49.339
that without Him, we can do nothing.

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:51.299
He is the vine.

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:53.619
We are the branches.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:56.259
We must abide in Him.

00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:57.499
He knows our frame.

00:25:57.499 --> 00:26:02.539
Listen, that problem that you have, that difficulty that you're dealing with, that emotional whatever

00:26:02.539 --> 00:26:08.539
that's going on, and you're struggling, God made you.

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:09.539
And He knows you.

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:13.779
And He's compassionate.

00:26:13.779 --> 00:26:20.899
Number seven, if you skip down to verse number 19, He rules and He reigns.

00:26:20.899 --> 00:26:28.579
The Bible says, the Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom ruleth

00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:31.899
over all.

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:36.459
And we live in a day like today, and it seems like things are so confusing, and there's

00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:43.939
chaos that is just seeming to reign, and man, every day the headlines change, and we just

00:26:43.939 --> 00:26:49.939
rest in knowing that our God, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:26:49.939 --> 00:26:52.939
He rules and He reigns.

00:26:52.939 --> 00:26:56.619
He's never been defeated, and He never will be.

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.659
You say, well what's going on?

00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:00.219
God's in control.

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:05.139
I may not know everything, but I do understand that He's long-suffering, and sometimes He's

00:27:05.139 --> 00:27:07.579
long-suffering to people.

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:12.459
When He's long-suffering to somebody else, we're like, come on, let's get going here.

00:27:12.459 --> 00:27:18.979
But in my life, when I want God to be long-suffering, I want Him to be long-suffering, right?

00:27:18.979 --> 00:27:23.579
God's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:28.459
Listen, I know that Jesus is coming back, and I pray that He comes back soon.

00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:34.059
But you know, there are billions of people in our world that are lost, and He's not willing

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:38.239
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.539
His timeline is perfect.

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:44.539
I don't know when He's going to return, but I know He rules and He reigns.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:48.659
When you see people that shake their fist at God, when you see people that act as if

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:54.179
they're the ones that are in control, just remind yourself of what Pilate said to Jesus.

00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:58.139
And Pilate said, don't you know that I have power to release you?

00:27:58.139 --> 00:28:00.379
Or I have power to crucify you?

00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:01.899
And what did Jesus say?

00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:05.919
In a meek kind of response, He said, don't you understand that the only power you have

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:08.499
is the power I give you?

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:10.339
Amen!

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:16.939
The Proverbs, the wise man Solomon said that the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.

00:28:16.939 --> 00:28:22.259
On Wednesday evening, Brother Maldolph preached from the book of Nehemiah, and he said, which

00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:23.259
brother are you?

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:27.619
And he spoke of Nehemiah and Hanani, but you understand that in the preliminaries of that

00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:32.539
message he shared with us how that God moved in the heart of Cyrus to have the people of

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:37.299
God return, that were in captivity.

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:46.619
Cyrus was His servant, He's the king, but God is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:52.859
I look at Psalm 103, and I know we didn't exhaustively study this passage this morning,

00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:58.700
but we find that the psalmist begins with this heart of praise, and it's passionate

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.380
praise.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.139
It's bless the Lord, O my soul, in all that is within me.

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:07.179
Bless His holy name.

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:12.539
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:13.539
How am I going to not forget?

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:15.019
Rehearse them.

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:22.940
We recognize that He daily loadeth us with benefits, and then we rehearse those benefits.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.059
At least seven.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:27.419
You study Psalm 103, you might find more.

00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:32.299
I kind of coupled several together in verse number eight, when I spoke about who God is.

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:36.519
But I'm going to tell you, the songwriter said, count your blessings, name them one

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:42.059
by one, and it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:50.299
I wonder, when's the last time you were struggling, dealing with just living in this world?

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:55.219
And instead of complaining and murmuring, and woe is me, and I don't know what's going

00:29:55.219 --> 00:29:59.139
on, just take out a sheet of paper and just start writing down the blessings of God.

00:29:59.139 --> 00:30:06.519
one by one. One by one. See how many sheets you can fill up. See how far you

00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:14.499
can get. I mean, we can spend much time just praising God for who He is. Being

00:30:14.499 --> 00:30:20.859
mindful of His wonderful attributes. The psalmist in Psalm 150 made that clear

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:23.899
that we are to praise God not only for the things that He does, but we're to

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:28.659
praise God for who He is. I've said many times over the years that when we learn

00:30:28.659 --> 00:30:32.019
to praise God for who He is, we will never lack reason to rejoice because He

00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:37.259
never changes. He's immutable. And so when you begin to fill up your prayer time

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:41.499
with praise and you begin to start that time of prayer by praising God for who

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:46.179
He is, you're always going to have reason to rejoice. God, I don't understand this

00:30:46.179 --> 00:30:51.099
situation I'm in, but I understand who you are. I don't know how you're gonna

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:55.379
deal with this, but I know that you have a plan. This surprised me, but it didn't

00:30:55.379 --> 00:31:00.539
surprise you. Aren't you thankful for that? Have you ever been caught off guard?

00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:05.539
You ever been surprised? Blindsided, if you will? You say, man, I didn't see that

00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:11.219
coming. Listen, as vigilant as we try to be as human beings, there are times in

00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:16.579
which we get blindsided. Because we're not omniscient. We don't know all things.

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:21.299
We're not eternal in the same sense that God is of being

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:25.499
outside of time and seeing the end from the beginning. There are times in which

00:31:25.499 --> 00:31:28.419
things happen in our life we say, I didn't see that coming. I didn't

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:34.739
expect that. But when we know who God is, we can rest in knowing that it didn't

00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:45.859
surprise Him. God has never said, I didn't see that coming. Never. Jesus Christ is

00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:49.779
the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world. Before Adam and

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:53.539
Eve ever sinned in the garden, God knew they were going to sin and God provided

00:31:53.539 --> 00:32:01.299
a way. Because our God is outside of time. He is Alpha and Omega. He has no beginning,

00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:07.939
no ending. And He has never been caught off guard. See, the psalmist is rehearsing

00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:14.659
the benefits. We recognize, we rehearse them. I'd ask this question, how is it

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:19.119
that we should, number three, what is our response to all His benefits? Well, we see

00:32:19.119 --> 00:32:25.319
it in this passage. The response is one of rejoicing, of praise. The response is

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:31.479
one of just, just bless the Lord. He says, all that is within me, bless His holy

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:38.199
name. Notice what the psalmist says. Turn over to Psalm 116, if you will. Another

00:32:38.199 --> 00:32:43.119
psalm here, and much praise is mentioned here. Again, if we were to take the time to

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.199
read through the entirety of the psalm, you would see that there are many

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:51.919
references here with regard to the blessings, the benefits of the Lord, who

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:59.519
He is, what He does. The Bible speaks of, in Psalm 116 and verse 15, precious in

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:02.839
the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. Why? As we understand the

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:06.039
whole, the entirety of the Bible, to be absent from the body is to be present with

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:10.679
the Lord. But I want you to notice the question that the psalmist asks in verse

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:23.239
number 12. What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me? What

00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:29.599
is it that I shall render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me? We once

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:35.279
again see this phrase, all His benefits. Remember, the psalmist said in Psalm 103

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:40.359
and verse 2, forget not all His benefits. Here he says, what is it that I shall

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:44.959
render unto the Lord for all His benefits? The psalmist said in Psalm 68, he did not

00:33:44.959 --> 00:33:51.919
use that phrase, but he said, He daily loadeth us with benefits. And so here, the

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:56.119
psalmist asks an appropriate question, but you understand that in asking this

00:33:56.119 --> 00:34:01.439
question, it's not as if we owe God something as far as, you did this for me

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:06.959
and so I have to pay you back with something. It's not really the idea. The

00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:11.559
idea is that when I recognize all of His benefits and I rehearse all of His

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:17.279
benefits, my response is going to be one of praise and thanksgiving. My response

00:34:17.279 --> 00:34:21.479
is going to be one of a life of surrender, that I recognize all that

00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:26.079
He has done for me and I've daily rehearsed. And so we sing the song about

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:32.279
living for Jesus. Why? Because of all that He's done for me, because of all that He

00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:38.919
is. Notice in verse number 17 of this passage here in Psalm 116, it says, I will

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:44.079
offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:47.239
of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all those

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.279
people. Notice verse 19, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O

00:34:51.279 --> 00:34:57.919
Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord. Psalm 117 is a very short psalm, two verses, but

00:34:57.919 --> 00:35:03.119
notice these two verses in Psalm 117, O praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:08.119
Him, all ye people, for His merciful kindness is great toward us and the

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:15.679
truth of the Lord endureth forever. Praise ye the Lord. We're living in the

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:23.559
midst of a time where people have said, what is truth? You can't know truth. Truth

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:33.759
is relative. Your truth, my truth, their truth. Nonsense. Truth is truth. Jesus

00:35:33.759 --> 00:35:39.439
Christ said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father

00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:46.359
but by me. His truth endureth forever. Aren't you thankful for that? You

00:35:46.359 --> 00:35:51.119
understand the truth is constantly under attack, though. Why? Because Satan's a

00:35:51.119 --> 00:36:01.079
liar. And so truth is constantly under attack, but truth endures because God

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:08.919
said it would. Begin to think about our response, the response of praise and

00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:13.439
thanksgiving. We're mindful of the truth in 1 Thessalonians, turn of the New

00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:17.479
Testament, if you will, in chapter number 5 of the book of 1 Thessalonians, and

00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:25.119
it's a familiar verse of Scripture to us, but as we consider this morning, this

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:30.559
thought of the psalmist in Psalm 103, forget not all his benefits, I've

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:38.679
recognized them, I've rehearsed them, and what's my response? In verse 18, notice

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:44.999
with me in verse 16, it says, rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In

00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:53.559
everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:59.999
you. I believe this morning that our response as the people of God to all of

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:08.199
his benefits is one of rejoicing, one of praise. Our God is worthy. The word

00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:12.719
worship in our English language, it originally carried with it the idea of

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:22.719
worthship. He is worthy of our praise. He is worthy of our thanksgiving. And this

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:28.879
morning, as we would notice some parallels perhaps as I began the

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:32.959
meeting this morning and the introduction, if you will, to the message

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:37.639
with speaking about some of the sad realities of what we're living in in

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:43.479
2021 with regard to our nation and our heritage. And the fact that there's a

00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:48.879
generation today that would literally sign a petition to get rid of a holiday

00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:58.439
that exists because of the sacrifice of those that preserve the freedom

00:37:58.439 --> 00:38:05.079
that we enjoy. And they're just clueless. That's probably the best word to think

00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:11.159
of. They're clueless. In fact, and I don't know, I'm just gonna share what the

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:16.799
article said about this fake petition. I've never seen the movie Frozen, but

00:38:16.799 --> 00:38:20.359
some of you have. The guy that was writing the article said that he's a

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:24.799
Marine but he has a daughter and he's watched Frozen too many times. But

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:29.399
evidently there's a snowman in that movie. Is that true? Come on, somebody

00:38:29.399 --> 00:38:33.119
help me out. I know somebody's seen Frozen, right? Okay, there's a snowman,

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:37.479
Olaf or something like this, right? And he's singing a song about looking

00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:45.079
forward to the summer. Is this true? Okay, now how stupid is that? That a snowman

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:51.879
is looking forward to the summer. He ain't gonna exist anymore. That was the

00:38:51.879 --> 00:38:55.599
parallel that the person that wrote the article about these people signing this

00:38:55.599 --> 00:39:00.159
fake petition. I thought, man, now you confirmed that that story is true

00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:04.319
about Frozen. I'd never seen the movie. I think my kids were a little bit too

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:08.019
old when Frozen came out that I didn't have to sit there and watch it. But the

00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:17.439
reality is that, listen, the same things happened in the Church of God. There's a

00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:25.319
generation that has raised up that has forgotten all of his benefits. Listen, I'm

00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:30.359
saddened at the state of our country that there are young people that do not

00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:34.599
recognize the the ultimate price that was paid for the freedom that they

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:45.239
enjoy. I'm saddened by that. Breaks my heart. But as the Church of God, there are

00:39:45.239 --> 00:39:53.799
some young people that were raised in church that are no longer in church.

00:39:53.799 --> 00:39:58.919
They've walked away. They've turned their back.

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:03.099
They've forgotten the Lord.

00:40:03.099 --> 00:40:05.719
Is that not sad to you?

00:40:05.719 --> 00:40:06.719
Breaks my heart."

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:10.559
I said, what happened?

00:40:10.559 --> 00:40:12.279
I don't know the answer to the question.

00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:16.399
In fact, people that are much smarter than I am have written many books on it.

00:40:16.399 --> 00:40:20.799
It's a problem that has been widely recognized in churches in America.

00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:32.559
There's a poll that was recently taken that a high percentage of those within the Millennials

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:40.199
said they don't know and don't care if there even is a God.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:45.159
But I just wonder sometimes about the state of the church.

00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:48.039
We can see the state of our nation, it's sad.

00:40:48.039 --> 00:40:49.039
Breaks our heart.

00:40:49.279 --> 00:40:56.039
But what about the state of the church, that people could be raised up?

00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:58.439
I mean, think about the nation of Israel.

00:40:58.439 --> 00:41:00.439
Isn't that what happened with the nation of Israel?

00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:04.079
Psalm, let's just think about Judges.

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:08.679
There was another generation that knew not the Lord.

00:41:08.679 --> 00:41:09.679
What did they do?

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:10.679
They served Balaam.

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:16.599
Judges, go back and read it.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:22.039
Generation that rose up after Joshua and all the elders, and they served Balaam.

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:24.199
Psalm 78 gives us the answer.

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:30.319
How is it that we ensure that a future generation would set their hope in God, not forsake God?

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:33.119
We have to rehearse His benefits.

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:37.279
We got to share with the generation, hey, our God is good.

00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:40.119
Our God is real.

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:45.679
We got to have some memorials even as the people of God.

00:41:45.759 --> 00:41:51.839
To come to this place where the psalmist says, forget not all His benefits.

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:57.879
I hope that the generation to come in our church, I hope that your children, that my

00:41:57.879 --> 00:42:04.719
children, regularly hear us rehearsing the blessings of God.

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:09.839
That they regularly hear us talking about how good God is.

00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:16.799
Listen, your kids don't need to hear you complaining about life and church and the

00:42:16.799 --> 00:42:18.959
pastor's message.

00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:22.399
No one would complain about that, I'm sure.

00:42:22.399 --> 00:42:23.399
Amen.

00:42:23.399 --> 00:42:24.919
Right, Armando?

00:42:24.919 --> 00:42:29.759
But I'm just saying, what does that do?

00:42:29.759 --> 00:42:32.519
What do you think that does to your children?

00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:34.259
It doesn't help them.

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:37.039
It doesn't cause them to want to serve God.

00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:43.159
It doesn't cause them to have that desire to go and do for the Lord all that He said

00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:44.839
that we should do.

00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:47.879
The Bible talks about, I believe it's in Psalm 106, I don't have it in my notes here, let

00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:52.319
me just check to see if that's the right Psalm, and if not, we'll just keep on going forward.

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:57.039
I think it's in Psalm 106.

00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:03.479
The Bible talks about here in Psalm 106 the way in which they talked and spoke badly about

00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:08.879
the Lord and how they were doing that even within their tents.

00:43:08.879 --> 00:43:14.759
And the reality is that they sang His praises, they believed, but then they soon forgot.

00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.359
Look at verse number 13 of Psalm 106.

00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:21.479
They soon forgot His works, they waited not for His counsel.

00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:25.339
They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert.

00:43:25.339 --> 00:43:30.439
He gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul in verse number 15.

00:43:30.439 --> 00:43:33.839
It talks about the way in which they changed things in verse 21.

00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:38.119
They forgot God their Savior which had done great things in Egypt.

00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:39.679
Wow.

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:41.239
They despised the pleasant land.

00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:43.939
They believed not His word in verse number 24.

00:43:43.939 --> 00:43:45.359
Look at verse 25.

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:48.919
But murmured in their tents.

00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:54.079
Now for them, what was their tent?

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:58.139
Their home, their dwelling place, right?

00:43:58.139 --> 00:44:02.199
And they murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

00:44:02.199 --> 00:44:06.579
What do you think their murmuring did to that next generation?

00:44:06.579 --> 00:44:08.579
Further and further away.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:13.859
I understand that we have problems and difficulties, but can we not recognize this morning that

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:15.539
our God is good?

00:44:15.539 --> 00:44:18.179
I mean, through the storms He's good.

00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:20.139
He's got a purpose and a plan.

00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:23.619
And so what happens sometimes in our lives is when we're in the midst of the storm, we

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:26.259
begin to complain and murmur because we're in the midst of it.

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:28.779
We don't know all that God's doing.

00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:33.779
Then we get through the storm and perhaps we've learned that lesson, that lesson that

00:44:33.779 --> 00:44:36.099
could only be learned in that storm.

00:44:36.099 --> 00:44:41.899
We say, oh God, thank you for teaching me that lesson.

00:44:41.899 --> 00:44:49.499
And I wonder if we've murmured about the storm and our children heard that, did we go back

00:44:49.499 --> 00:44:54.619
and say, hey listen, I know I complained about that storm, but man, God taught me something.

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:57.779
Can I share with you what God taught me?

00:44:57.779 --> 00:45:01.979
I'm not suggesting that we completely erase from their minds that murmuring, but you know

00:45:01.979 --> 00:45:06.859
there's some times in which we need to go back and say, listen, God's been good to us.

00:45:06.859 --> 00:45:14.739
This morning, the state of our nation is sad, but I would say that the state of our church,

00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:20.419
broadly speaking, there's a generation that has forgotten the Lord, just as there's a

00:45:20.419 --> 00:45:28.659
generation that has forgotten the sacrifice of many to preserve the freedom in this nation.

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:36.379
And today, we're challenged by this thought of the psalmist, forget not all his benefits.

00:45:36.379 --> 00:45:38.179
I need to recognize them.

00:45:38.179 --> 00:45:42.379
Oh, he daily loadeth me with benefits.

00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:43.899
God's been good.

00:45:43.899 --> 00:45:47.619
Every day, God's been good.

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:48.979
And then we rehearse them.

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:49.979
Let's talk about the Lord.

00:45:49.979 --> 00:45:51.979
Let's talk about what he's done.

00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:57.419
Maybe we get around the table and, hey, share testimony, share a blessing, what did God

00:45:57.419 --> 00:45:58.419
do for you today?

00:45:58.419 --> 00:46:02.339
How's God good to you today?

00:46:02.339 --> 00:46:06.499
Because our response as we rehearse them, our response is one of, bless the Lord, oh

00:46:06.499 --> 00:46:13.419
my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

00:46:13.419 --> 00:46:18.099
Our God is worthy of our worship and our praise and our thanksgiving.

00:46:18.219 --> 00:46:20.219
Forget not all his benefits.

00:46:20.219 --> 00:46:21.219
Let's pray.

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:23.019
Father, we love you.

00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:27.539
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:34.099
We readily acknowledge this morning that you've been good to us.

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:44.539
We agree with the psalmist that you have daily loadeth us with benefits.

00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:50.859
The psalmist asked that question, what shall we render unto the Lord for all of his benefits?

00:46:50.859 --> 00:47:00.739
I believe an answer that is worth giving is one of praise and thanksgiving, adoration,

00:47:00.739 --> 00:47:04.299
standing in awe of who you are.

00:47:04.299 --> 00:47:12.939
God as we have seen in our nation, a generation that has risen up that has forgotten the sacrifice

00:47:12.939 --> 00:47:22.899
of a former generation, I pray God that it would not be so in the church.

00:47:22.899 --> 00:47:28.339
Not only would we be mindful of the freedoms that we have as Americans and the sacrifice

00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:36.219
that was made to protect and preserve those freedoms, that we'd be mindful as the people

00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:44.259
of God for all of your benefits, that our children, a generation to come, would set

00:47:44.259 --> 00:47:52.379
their hope in God, they would serve you faithfully, they'd live for you.

00:47:52.379 --> 00:47:57.099
I'm not sure, Lord, how you've worked in hearts and lives today, but I pray that you'd help

00:47:57.099 --> 00:48:01.459
us to respond, help us to just thank you.

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:08.659
Perhaps there's one that's not sure of heaven, whether here or watching live stream.

00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:14.139
The group sang about being saved this morning, we spoke about forgiveness.

00:48:14.139 --> 00:48:21.099
I pray God that you would help them today to understand their need for Christ.

00:48:21.099 --> 00:48:25.859
For we as thy people, help us to rejoice in thee.

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:28.339
Well thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:28.339 --> 00:48:29.779
Would you stand with me?

00:48:29.779 --> 00:48:32.779
Eyes are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:35.700
Forget not all his benefits.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.659
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.

00:48:38.659 --> 00:48:42.859
Maybe you just need to come to the altar this morning and just rejoice for a little bit.

00:48:42.859 --> 00:48:44.459
Just thank God for his benefits.

00:48:44.459 --> 00:48:47.940
Maybe as a family, right there in your pew, you just want to sit down or come to the altar

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.940
as a family and just say, let's thank God as a family for all his benefits, because

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.519
truly God has been good to us.

00:48:56.519 --> 00:48:57.760
Forget not all his benefits.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.399
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
