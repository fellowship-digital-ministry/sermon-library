1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
And now looking at this 11th chapter and this will be our third lesson from Hebrews chapter 11

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,619
And we look forward to dealing with verses 8 through 22 this morning and last week

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,040
We looked at verses 4 through 7. We dealt with the subject matter of living by faith

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,899
We entitled it living by faith part 1 and we looked at three individuals Abel

5
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,479
We looked at the worship of Abel

6
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:26,479
We looked at the walk of Enoch and the work of Noah

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,559
This morning as we look at verses 8 through 22

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,119
Primarily be dealing with the life of Abraham and we are reminded of the great faith of this individual

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,799
Of course a great patriarch a man that as we have mentioned throughout the the weeks of study

10
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,799
And of course various other portions of scripture that we've studied as well

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,400
We have discussed the influence of Abraham and how he is held in high regard

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,319
By the Jewish people and this chapter devotes much space to

13
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,400
the life of Abraham

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,119
In fact as we get in verse number 8 you begin looking at the truth of

15
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:09,000
Genesis chapter 11 and chapter 12 and the call of Abram as you move through the passage of scripture by the time you come down

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,879
To verse number 19 and 20 and and look at what's going on there

17
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:20,760
You find the influence upon future generations and how that Abraham lived by faith and had the opportunity to influence

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,480
His offspring and of course in verse number 19 really 17 through 19 dealing with the events in Genesis 22

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,400
And so very thankful for the opportunity to look at this passage of scripture

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
And I'm reminded of a conversation that the Lord Jesus Christ had with the religious leaders

21
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,000
During his earthly ministry there in John chapter number 8 and as he's having this discussion with these

22
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:50,040
Religious leaders of the day the the the name Abraham comes up in the discussion and many times they refer to Abraham

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
And what have you and it's amazing what the Lord Jesus Christ declares to us often

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,639
We speak about John 8 in verse number 58 when he says before Abraham was I am and what great truth that is

25
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,519
But in verse number 56 of John chapter number 8

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Jesus said this Abraham

27
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,320
rejoiced to see my day and

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,080
He saw it and was glad we think about that

29
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:19,160
Declaration that Jesus made in John 8 in verse number 56

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,860
We see that Abraham saw it by faith and as we examine this passage of scripture this morning

31
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,399
We're going to learn more about what it means to live by faith

32
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,360
we understand that the believers that are being written to here in the book of Hebrews that they are

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
given the

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,399
challenge to

35
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,520
Continue and to go on and to live by faith

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,720
In fact as you ended the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews you find that he quotes from

37
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:50,080
That Old Testament passage in Habakkuk that the just shall live

38
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:54,160
By faith and we today are called to live by faith

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,839
And we understand that the passage here in Hebrews 11 says without faith

40
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:05,119
It is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a

41
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:11,440
Rewarder of them that diligently seek him and so are thankful for the opportunity to live by faith

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,399
I am often reminded as I read Hebrews chapter 11 that as we read about these

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,160
Individuals and their great testimony and how they lived by faith and what they were able to see God

44
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:27,119
Accomplish I'm reminded of this. They really didn't have any example to look to

45
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,559
We

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,000
Have so many examples to look to we have not only those that are contained within the Word of God the

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,320
The great list that is provided for us here in Hebrews 11

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,000
But those that have gone before us

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,199
in church history that have lived by faith that we can look to their lives and we can see examples of

50
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,399
Living by faith and how God blesses and how God always does what he says

51
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:55,880
He will do yet when we look at this list of folks that are mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,440
I ask you who did they have to look to what book of record did they have to look to know they believed God?

53
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,839
They trust it God and they lived by faith

54
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:12,399
This morning we have many examples and we're so thankful for them as we dig in to the passage of Scripture

55
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:18,239
I want you to see in verses 8 through 10 if you're taking notes this morning number one living by faith requires

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,399
daily submission

57
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,399
to God's direction

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,359
Living by faith requires daily submission to God's direction. Are we going to obey God or not?

59
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,160
Look at it in verse 8 by faith Abraham

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,000
When he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance

61
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:41,359
Obeyed look at the end of verse number 8 and he went out

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,559
Not knowing with her he went

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,200
By faith he sojourned in the land of promises in a strange country

64
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:56,839
Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city

65
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:01,920
Which has foundations whose builder and maker is God?

66
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,640
As we think about these first few verses we study this passage this morning

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,079
we find that Abraham was a man that submitted to the direction of God and as we live by faith as we

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,559
Are going to obey the command that God has given us in his word that the just shall live

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,640
By faith that we must come to the place that we are submitting to the direction that God gives in his leadership in our lives

70
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,239
We sing songs about following the Lord. We sing songs about where he leads me

71
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:37,160
I will go and we sing about those truths and it's wonderful to be reminded of that Bible truth through song

72
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:43,839
But this morning as we think about the leadership of God in the direction of God, we find that God is faithful to provide it

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,760
God is faithful to provide direction and

74
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,000
Abraham he went out he obeyed he went out not knowing with her

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,839
He went the Bible tells us that he sojourned notice how it's referred to in the land of promise as in a strange

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
country dwelling in tabernacles

77
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,239
you think about the

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Phraseology there and thinking about tents and he's dwelling

79
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,959
There in something that is not a permanent structure in a land that has been promised

80
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,279
It's interesting what Stephen says while he's preaching in Acts chapter number seven

81
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,200
You don't need to turn over there

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,119
But next seven we find that the sermon of Stephen really begins

83
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:27,440
With the call of Abraham as you look in Acts chapter number seven you find in verse number two

84
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
That's exactly where he begins his message

85
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:35,640
It begins to speak about Abraham and he says this of Abraham in verse number five and he gave him none

86
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,119
Inheritance in it. No, not so much as to set his foot on

87
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:48,119
Yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he

88
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,119
Had no child

89
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,760
We find that even in our Sunday evening series as we've been going through the book of Genesis

90
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,779
And we've been in that section dealing with the life of Abraham and all that God is showing us

91
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,920
In as he follows as Abraham follows the Lord we find here this reminder that we are to live by faith

92
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,760
And if we live by faith, we must submit to the direction of God

93
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,160
see because submitting to the direction of God is living by faith and we find that as I

94
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:28,920
Hear the the voice of God as I follow the direction of the Lord in my life. That obedience is based upon faith

95
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,440
We sing the song trust and obey we trust him because he's trustworthy

96
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,279
We obey him because it's appropriate for us to do so and we find that faith is necessary

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,519
We look at the the passage and we see the obedience

98
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,320
We see that he sojourned in verse number nine notice in verse number ten that he looked for a city which has foundations

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Whose builder and maker is God now?

100
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,640
We've studied Genesis 11 and 12 and 13 and we've discussed those passages of scripture over the last several

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,739
Sunday evenings and as we've studied those passages of scripture, we've noticed how that Abraham

102
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:13,600
Journeyed and how that he followed the direction of the Lord and here this morning as we would understand in our lives

103
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
What's God's direction for us?

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,399
Well, how is God leading us as we would look to the Word of God and seek the face of God?

105
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:27,600
I've often said to young people as we would think about their lives and think about the plans that they have for their lives

106
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,599
So often the question is asked of young people. What do you want to do with your life a

107
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,840
Far better question is what does God want to do with your life?

108
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,559
Are you willing to submit to the direction of God in your life?

109
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,719
Are you willing to go where God would call are you willing to do what God has called you to do?

110
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,880
Are we willing to follow the direction of the Lord?

111
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:57,359
We find that faith requires that we would daily submit to the direction of God

112
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,119
And and I think about the the emphasis that I worded it that way on purpose because it's a daily submission

113
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,679
It's a daily

114
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,359
following the Lord Jesus Christ and having

115
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,900
That truth of his direction before us and we would follow his voice

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,679
Notice that living by faith as we continue to move through the passage of scripture in verses 11 through 16 living by faith

117
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:25,320
Embraces the promises of God we sang this morning standing on the promises

118
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,159
I didn't select the song Dean picks the songs and I did not request that song

119
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,280
But how appropriate that song is for the passage of scripture that is before us this morning

120
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,000
And I think about the promises of God and I think about the way in which faith

121
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,479
Requires that we would embrace the promises of God

122
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,640
We have the whole Word of God

123
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,039
I'm so thankful this morning that we have the complete canon of scripture that we can

124
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:56,840
Go to the Word of God and we can read of his promises and we can be encouraged and strengthened

125
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,039
But the reality is that we understand the

126
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,239
the importance of embracing these promises,

127
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,959
believing them,

128
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,119
saying as Paul said in Acts 27,

129
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:13,119
I believe God that it shall be as He said.

130
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,119
We come to this passage of Scripture

131
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,739
and we think about the promises

132
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,439
that were given to Abraham

133
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,439
and we would boil them down to two.

134
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,359
It was a land and it was a seed

135
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,199
as we'd consider the aspect of those truths

136
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,239
and we would find that as we would embrace

137
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,239
the promises of God that we see here

138
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,679
in v. 11 that Sarah is mentioned,

139
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,599
of course, the spouse of Abraham

140
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,319
and they had been promised a son.

141
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:40,479
That son would be the promise

142
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,399
that God would give of the seed

143
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,239
and we find that in v. 11,

144
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,239
the Bible says through faith also,

145
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,999
Sarah herself received strength

146
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,399
to conceive seed

147
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,239
and was delivered of a child

148
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,319
when she was past age

149
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,719
because she judged Him faithful

150
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,559
who had promised.

151
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,599
We begin to think about the truth

152
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,399
of this verse of Scripture

153
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,799
and the faith of Sarah

154
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,199
and now we begin to see Abraham and Sarah

155
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,159
and we think about this faith journey

156
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,719
as being a family journey

157
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,719
that we believe the promises of God

158
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,759
and we find that the Bible tells us

159
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,039
in v. 11 at the end

160
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,999
that she judged Him faithful

161
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,399
who had promised.

162
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,039
Now you understand that God had promised

163
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,439
this son for a number of years

164
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,599
and God had restated the promise

165
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,319
and yet there were some times,

166
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,679
remember, Sarah laughed the Bible tells us

167
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,719
and we find that Sarah said something

168
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,879
about Abraham going to Hagar

169
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,199
and we understand those things

170
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,679
as we'd study and read in the book of Genesis,

171
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,639
but we find that eventually,

172
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,159
Sarah came around and believed

173
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,479
what God said.

174
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,639
Sarah understood that the promise

175
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,679
that God made that she judged Him faithful

176
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,719
who had promised.

177
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,999
It's interesting to me

178
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,719
that as you read the book of Genesis

179
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,919
and you go through the account of Scripture

180
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,479
and you find that God says to Abraham,

181
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,559
why did Sarah laugh?

182
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,439
You ever wonder why God didn't ask Sarah

183
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,799
why she laughed?

184
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,559
He asked Abraham.

185
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,239
Abraham had been given the promise

186
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,719
directly from God

187
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,519
and Abraham had the responsibility

188
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,159
of sharing that promise with his wife

189
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,359
and influencing her and encouraging her

190
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,999
and helping to bring her along

191
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,359
in that faith journey

192
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,919
and we find that eventually,

193
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,319
she does come to that place

194
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,919
where she's believing the promise of God

195
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,879
and she counted, she judged

196
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,799
Him, God, faithful who had made the promise.

197
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,559
You know that promises

198
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,639
are only as good as the person that makes them.

199
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,119
You think about that just for a moment.

200
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,959
Someone could make you a promise.

201
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,599
They could promise you all sorts of things.

202
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,759
I remember when we were in Bible college,

203
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,999
the Bible college that I attended,

204
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:44,959
they were trying to raise money.

205
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,519
They were always trying to raise money.

206
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,159
And they were trying to offset

207
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,359
some of the tuition costs

208
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,519
and so on and so forth.

209
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,879
And someone made this just a huge promise

210
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,439
of a donation.

211
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,679
I remember the faculty being excited

212
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,119
about this particular promise

213
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,159
and what have you.

214
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,719
And we find that after a short period of time,

215
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,999
there was absolutely no possibility

216
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,679
that this promise would be fulfilled

217
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,119
by the individual that made it

218
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,239
because they flat out didn't have it.

219
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,999
And as they were asked the question,

220
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:17,159
they said, well, if I get it, I'll give it.

221
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,599
Kind of a situation.

222
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,839
And so they were hoping

223
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,599
and having some confidence in a promise

224
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,199
that was just not gonna come to pass.

225
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,679
And I tell you this morning,

226
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,719
that the Lord God Almighty,

227
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,239
the God of heaven and earth,

228
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,239
the Creator of all things,

229
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,679
He has given us some promises.

230
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,079
And we can trust Him

231
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959
and we must judge that He is faithful.

232
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,999
We must understand that God is not a man

233
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:43,279
that He should lie.

234
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,519
We find this morning

235
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,439
that as we look at the passage of Scripture

236
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,239
that as God says to Abraham,

237
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,839
is anything too hard for the Lord?

238
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,119
We would answer the question,

239
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,159
no, there's nothing too difficult for our God.

240
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,079
He's able to do, as Paul says,

241
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,919
exceeding abundantly above

242
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,519
all that we would ask or think.

243
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,519
And we find that she judged Him faithful

244
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,359
who had promised this morning.

245
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,719
Are you standing on the promises?

246
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,599
We sang the song,

247
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,479
but are we really standing on the promises?

248
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,639
Are we really believing

249
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,639
that God will do what He said He will do?

250
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,919
Are we really believing it?

251
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,239
Have we, look, as we go through the passage,

252
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,799
we begin to see in verse number 13,

253
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,079
let me read verse 12 first.

254
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:25,919
It says this,

255
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,119
therefore sprang there even of one

256
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,159
and him as good as dead,

257
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,599
speaking about Abraham

258
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,599
and of course he was also past age

259
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,919
as we find that is mentioned of Sarah

260
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,799
in verse number 11.

261
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,119
And it says so many as the stars of the sky in multitude

262
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:46,079
and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable.

263
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,719
You know that when you embrace the promises of God,

264
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:51,879
you get to see God work miracles.

265
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,239
You get to see God work.

266
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,399
You get to see God do something

267
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,559
that only God can do.

268
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,759
I was reading this morning in my own personal devotions.

269
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,959
I was reading through the book of Acts

270
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,079
and as I came upon the miracle of Acts chapter number three

271
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,359
and Acts chapter number four,

272
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,599
I was reminded again about the power of God

273
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,039
and the miracle that was there recorded

274
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,919
in Acts chapter number three

275
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,719
of that lame man that was healed.

276
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,439
And you find that in chapter number four

277
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,879
as they are questioning Peter and John,

278
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,279
they make the statement,

279
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,519
listen, we really can't deny it

280
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,919
because the guy is standing right here that was healed.

281
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,879
And I love the passage of Scripture

282
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,639
because you find that Peter and John are being questioned

283
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,959
and standing right next to him

284
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,559
is the man that had laid lame at the gate beautiful.

285
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,719
What are they gonna say?

286
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,479
No, that didn't happen.

287
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,599
John chapter number nine,

288
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:41,679
the man that was born blind that is healed by Jesus Christ,

289
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,239
we find that they say, no, no, no, he's not him,

290
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,799
but he's one like him.

291
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,039
And he says, I am him.

292
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,039
I was blind and now I see.

293
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,359
And we find this morning

294
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,479
that we serve a God of the impossible.

295
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,599
We serve a God that is able to do miracles.

296
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:01,479
And we find this morning that he works miraculously

297
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:04,079
as we embrace the promises of God,

298
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,279
as we live by faith.

299
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,599
Look at verse 13 with me.

300
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,199
These all died.

301
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,479
Notice what it says, in faith.

302
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,959
But it says this, not having received the promises,

303
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,399
the fullness of the promise that had been made to Abraham

304
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,999
had not yet come to pass.

305
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,999
We find that when Abraham died,

306
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,239
as was mentioned in Acts 7 by Stephen in verse number five,

307
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,999
he had no possession of the land.

308
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:39,439
Save a plot of land for the burial of his wife.

309
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,679
If you look in Genesis, that's what you find.

310
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,919
They did not receive the promise as we would think,

311
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,639
but I want you to consider what is said in verse number 13,

312
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,399
coupled with the last statement of verse number nine,

313
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,719
when it says that he was dwelling in tabernacles

314
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:57,239
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him,

315
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,079
what does it say?

316
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,679
Of the same promise.

317
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,319
It continues in verse number 13 and says this,

318
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,639
but having seen them afar off,

319
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,479
notice what it says,

320
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:13,479
and were persuaded of them and embraced them

321
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,359
and confessed that they were strangers

322
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,399
and pilgrims on the earth.

323
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,839
We begin to think about this embracing,

324
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,399
being persuaded of the promises

325
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,479
and embracing the promises of God.

326
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,239
We find that God's timetable is not always our timetable.

327
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,639
There are things in which we look at the promises of God

328
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,719
and we begin to look at the Word of God and say,

329
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,159
it'd be okay if that would happen today.

330
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:38,799
I'd be perfectly fine with you fulfilling that promise

331
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,519
in my life today, Lord,

332
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,359
but God's timing is not always our timing.

333
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,959
But let me say this, God's timing is always perfect.

334
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,799
Sometimes we get ahead of God.

335
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,679
We find that God's never late.

336
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,559
He's never early.

337
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
He's always right on time.

338
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,839
When the fullness of time was come

339
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,279
is what Paul says in Galatians

340
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,119
with regard to the coming of our Savior,

341
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,479
the Lord Jesus Christ.

342
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,519
And we find here that we are to receive these promises

343
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,279
and that we are to be persuaded of them

344
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,919
and we are to embrace them.

345
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,799
We find that it says at the end of the verse

346
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,759
that they confess that they were strangers

347
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,319
and pilgrims on the earth.

348
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,199
It's an interesting phrase of Scripture

349
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,679
and we're reminded of that song that we sing,

350
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,279
this world is not my home.

351
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,439
I'm just a passing through.

352
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,959
This idea of being a stranger and pilgrim

353
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:31,279
carries with it the idea of being away from home,

354
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,079
but going home.

355
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Think about that.

356
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,759
I'm away from home, but I'm going home.

357
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,759
This world is not my home.

358
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,719
If you're saved this morning,

359
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,599
if Jesus Christ is your Savior,

360
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,440
we're looking not to nail down some stakes here

361
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,159
and have some level of permanence here.

362
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,000
Why?

363
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,759
Because I'm just a stranger and a pilgrim.

364
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,639
I'm away from home, but I'm going home.

365
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,759
And what a joy, what a blessing to understand that.

366
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,799
We find that he said in verse number 10

367
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,000
that he looked for a city which hath foundations,

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,119
whose builder and maker is God.

369
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,880
And we begin to look at verses 14

370
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,839
and down through verse number 16

371
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,119
and begin to see that perspective that they have

372
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,519
with regard to eternity.

373
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,479
Notice it says this,

374
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:14,959
for they that say such things

375
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:18,239
declare plainly that they seek a country.

376
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,839
And truly, if they had been mindful of that country

377
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,000
from whence they came out,

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,679
they might have had opportunity to have returned.

379
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,679
You understand that Abraham, as you look at his life,

380
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,639
yeah, there's some things you can look at and see.

381
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,079
Okay, he went down into Egypt

382
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,440
in Genesis chapter number 12, bad decision.

383
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You can look at those things.

384
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,880
But you know, he never went back to the Ur of the Chaldees.

385
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,959
He didn't go back.

386
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,599
He left that place.

387
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,159
He left the idolatry of that place.

388
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,759
He left the culture of that place.

389
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,079
And he followed God and he was not looking to go back.

390
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,599
And as God's people, we ought not desire to look back

391
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,279
or to go back to the world.

392
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,759
The world has nothing for us.

393
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,199
I'm in the world.

394
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,239
but I'm not of the world.

395
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,899
And we have to come to that understanding,

396
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,499
that realization in our lives.

397
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,659
And we find that it says in v. 16,

398
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,959
but now they desire,

399
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,959
notice what it says,

400
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,759
a better country.

401
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,199
That is in heavenly,

402
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,779
wherefore God is not ashamed

403
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,999
to be called their God,

404
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,779
for He hath prepared for them a city.

405
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,099
Oh, what a wonderful truth.

406
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,419
We find that Jesus said,

407
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,099
if you turn over to the book of John

408
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,179
in v. 17,

409
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,779
we begin to see what Jesus is praying.

410
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,519
And this is really the Lord's Prayer

411
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,619
as it's recorded here.

412
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,119
Before, He would go to the cross of Calvary

413
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,779
and we find that He's seeking

414
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,339
to glorify His Father.

415
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,739
And He goes through the passage

416
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,379
and He says right in the beginning,

417
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,899
the hour has come.

418
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,539
And as Jesus is praying in John 17,

419
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,259
we find that in v. 15,

420
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:53,779
He says, I pray not that thou shouldest

421
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,659
take them out of the world,

422
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,259
but that thou shouldest keep them

423
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,219
from the evil.

424
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,439
You understand that we live in an evil world.

425
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,839
You understand that the world,

426
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,959
the flesh, and the devil,

427
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,079
they're against us.

428
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,479
We understand that the enemy is against us,

429
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,419
but we find here that He says

430
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,819
that we would not be taken out of the world,

431
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,179
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

432
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:15,719
Notice what He says in v. 16,

433
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,959
they are not of the world,

434
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:22,339
even as I am not of the world.

435
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:24,559
Sanctify them through Thy truth.

436
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,799
Thy Word is truth.

437
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,199
They're strangers and pilgrims.

438
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,699
See, I think about this truth

439
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,779
when we embrace the promises of God.

440
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:34,979
You know what it does?

441
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,499
It impacts your perspective.

442
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,319
It changes your perspective.

443
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,099
This world is not all there is.

444
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,039
By the way, if this world was all there was,

445
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,299
we'd live differently.

446
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:49,499
We'd understand the American dream

447
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,379
and pursuing it and get the biggest

448
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,259
and the best and all that we can.

449
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:55,239
We'd understand that.

450
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,659
But this world is not all there is.

451
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,719
This world is just temporary.

452
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,039
This world is going to burn

453
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,439
with a fervent heat

454
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,959
is what the Bible tells us.

455
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,559
And we find here this morning

456
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,279
that as we embrace the promises of God,

457
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,459
it changes our perspective.

458
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,079
I would submit to you this morning

459
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,759
that we need our perspective changed.

460
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,059
Why? Because the world

461
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,759
and the marketing industry

462
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,519
is trying to influence our perspective

463
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,819
to think this is all there is.

464
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,399
You need the newest and the greatest

465
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,359
and the best and this is going to last.

466
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,999
And we say, no, no, I'm going home.

467
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:34,839
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger.

468
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,339
I'm away from home.

469
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,319
But I'm going home. Amen?

470
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,859
And we find that he says here,

471
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,819
when we think about this perspective,

472
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,459
I want you to consider Paul

473
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,019
in 2 Corinthians 4.

474
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,099
The Apostle Paul,

475
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,039
oh, he had a heavenly perspective, did he not?

476
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,279
We find that Abraham,

477
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,499
as we look in our text in Hebrews 11,

478
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,499
they were seeking a better country.

479
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,859
That isn't heavenly.

480
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,799
And the truth of having that eternal perspective,

481
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,319
the Apostle Paul as he walked upon this earth

482
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,339
and as he served the Lord Jesus Christ,

483
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,139
he declares to the church in Corinth

484
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:09,339
in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 16,

485
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:11,419
for which cause we faint not,

486
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,499
but though our outward man perish,

487
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:16,899
yet the inward man is renewed day by day

488
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,299
for our light affliction,

489
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,039
which is but for a moment,

490
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,899
worketh for us a far more exceeding

491
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:26,439
and eternal weight of glory.

492
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,559
Why?

493
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,839
While we look not at the things which are seen,

494
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,079
but at the things which are not seen.

495
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,279
For the things which are seen are temporal,

496
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,119
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

497
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,439
I sat in a man's house a few years ago now,

498
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,839
just a few miles from here,

499
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,319
and I sat in his house.

500
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,559
His son actually came to our vacation Bible school

501
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,159
several years ago.

502
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:52,519
We're doing follow-up visits

503
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,879
and Joseph was with me,

504
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,799
and as we're doing these follow-up visits,

505
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,199
I sat in this man's living room.

506
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,519
He invited us in and we had a nice conversation.

507
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,319
We began to talk about spiritual matters.

508
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,759
And he acknowledged that he was not saved.

509
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,399
That he was not sure of heaven.

510
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,839
He acknowledged that.

511
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,479
Began to share the Gospel with him.

512
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,679
Began to go through some truth.

513
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,879
And he just was kind of resistant.

514
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,519
I shouldn't say kind of. He was.

515
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,319
He was resistant to the truth

516
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,319
of the Word of God.

517
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,999
And he began to share some things.

518
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,719
And I asked him this question.

519
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:25,319
I said, sir, can I ask you this?

520
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,079
500 years from now,

521
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,439
what's going to matter?

522
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,679
You know, that man stopped

523
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,479
kind of dead in his thought process.

524
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:38,119
And he looked at me with all sincerity

525
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:41,719
and said, none of this is going to matter.

526
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,759
I said, sir, you know what?

527
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,279
You're absolutely correct.

528
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,519
None of it's going to matter.

529
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,159
In fact, unless you are some type

530
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,759
of a famous individual

531
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,999
and you do something of significance,

532
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,119
500 years from now,

533
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,719
people aren't even going to know who you are.

534
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,719
Some people think that the Lord's going to

535
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,159
not come back for 500 years.

536
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,199
But if he didn't come back for 500 years,

537
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,799
the reality is that most of us

538
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,119
aren't even going to find our names

539
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,679
on some kind of history book somewhere.

540
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,399
No one's going to know about us.

541
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,159
In fact, I don't even know

542
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,679
my great, great, great, great, great

543
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,119
whoever 500 years ago.

544
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,159
And most of you probably don't either

545
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,559
unless you're into the genealogy stuff.

546
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,479
But the reality this morning is that

547
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,399
we have to have our perspective impact it.

548
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,559
And how is our perspective impacted?

549
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,879
It's when we embrace the promises of God.

550
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,999
And as we live by faith,

551
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,999
we're going to embrace those promises.

552
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:31,839
Why?

553
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,959
Because we understand that God

554
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,879
is the one that's made the promises.

555
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,599
And that's faith.

556
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,919
Taking God at His word.

557
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,399
Believing what God has said.

558
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,119
In just another chapter in 2 Corinthians 5

559
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:44,999
in verse number 20,

560
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,399
Paul will say that we are ambassadors for Christ.

561
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:50,759
You understand that that carries

562
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,519
that same kind of thought

563
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,359
that we're looking at here

564
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,719
in Hebrews chapter 11.

565
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,319
That this world is not my home.

566
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,319
I'm an ambassador.

567
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,719
I'm a representative.

568
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,599
I understand this morning

569
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,279
that my citizenship is in heaven.

570
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,199
I'm thankful to be a U.S. citizen.

571
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,399
But my citizenship is in heaven.

572
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,919
We see that in Ephesians chapter number three,

573
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,039
excuse me, Philippians chapter number three

574
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,879
in verse number 20.

575
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,399
Paul is speaking.

576
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,719
And even before we get to verse number 20

577
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,919
in chapter number three,

578
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,039
we find that Paul tells them,

579
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,359
the believers in Philippi,

580
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,399
about the importance of living

581
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,879
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.

582
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:30,279
They're to live as lights that shine in this world.

583
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,599
And he comes to the end of chapter number three

584
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,959
and he says in verse number 20,

585
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,719
for our conversation is in heaven.

586
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:40,319
And that word conversation is synonymous

587
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,679
with that truth of citizenship.

588
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:43,959
My citizenship is in heaven.

589
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,079
If you're saved this morning,

590
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,279
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

591
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,519
as your personal Savior,

592
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,359
then heaven is your home.

593
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,559
And sometimes we don't live like that.

594
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,159
Sometimes we live like this earth

595
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,559
is all that there is.

596
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,679
We find that he says,

597
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,319
for our conversation is in heaven

598
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,999
from whence also we look for the Savior,

599
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,199
the Lord Jesus Christ.

600
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:09,399
I hope that you're looking for Jesus to return.

601
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,039
Paul says to Titus in Titus 2,

602
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,199
he says that we're looking for the blessed hope

603
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,439
and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,

604
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,879
the Lord Jesus Christ,

605
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,439
and we have that upward look of expectation

606
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,399
that Jesus is going to return.

607
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,319
Why? Because he promised to do so.

608
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,279
You notice at the end back in the book of Hebrews

609
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,719
in chapter 11,

610
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,159
the end of verse number 16 where it says this,

611
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,839
for he hath prepared for them a city.

612
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,999
Remember the truth of John chapter number 14.

613
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,359
Let not your heart be troubled.

614
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,399
You believe in God, believe also in me.

615
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,999
In my Father's house are many mansions.

616
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,359
If it were not so, I would have told you.

617
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,919
I go to prepare a place for you.

618
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,879
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

619
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,999
I will come again and receive you unto myself

620
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:52,519
that where I am, Jesus said,

621
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,319
there ye may be also speaking to his disciples.

622
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,999
And we understand by extension to us

623
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,639
as the people of God.

624
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:04,799
This morning, we noticed that Abraham,

625
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,159
his perspective changed

626
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,119
as he embraced the promises of God.

627
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,679
I think about this man Abraham.

628
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,399
Of course, we don't know much about him

629
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:14,799
when he was in the Ur of the Chaldees.

630
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,759
We know some things about the culture

631
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,279
and the way in which they worshiped

632
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,079
and were engaged in idol worship.

633
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,359
And I think about the path

634
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,159
in which Abraham journeyed and he traveled.

635
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,679
And as he daily followed and submitted

636
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,479
to the direction of God in his life,

637
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,319
and as he embraced the promises of God,

638
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,439
how he was able to see God work.

639
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:41,079
And his perspective was changed.

640
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,599
This morning, I hope that our perspective

641
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,799
is changed by the promises contained

642
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,999
within the Word of God.

643
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,079
That as we look at this Word,

644
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,639
as we read and study the Word of God,

645
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:55,879
that it impacts and influences us.

646
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,879
Someone says, why do you have the perspective

647
00:28:57,879 --> 00:28:58,719
that you do?

648
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,559
Why do you?

649
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,399
I hope that we can say,

650
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,319
well, it's based upon the truth of God's Word.

651
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,519
Because here's what God said in His Word.

652
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,159
Because here's what my understanding is

653
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,679
of the promises of God.

654
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,719
And this has shaped and influenced

655
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,199
my perspective in life.

656
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,679
Notice as we continue to go through

657
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,199
the passage of Scripture,

658
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,679
living by faith,

659
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,559
believes the impossible.

660
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,159
This morning, as we begin to think

661
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,319
about this truth of faith,

662
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,519
we think about what God is able to do,

663
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,439
we often make the reference

664
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,239
that our God is able to do anything.

665
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,719
And I wonder sometimes if it's hard

666
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,799
for us to really comprehend that.

667
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:43,719
If it really can be expressed in terms

668
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:46,519
that we could relate to.

669
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,799
And I find that sometimes in life,

670
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,159
I was listening to an individual,

671
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,399
by the way, speaking just last week.

672
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,159
No one from our congregation

673
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,839
has listened to this individual speaking.

674
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,319
And in their speech,

675
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,639
as they were seeking to be a religious

676
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:00,479
quote unquote,

677
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:06,919
leader and speak about faith, they were expressing their own doubt about what God is able to

678
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:07,919
do.

679
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,139
It was mind-boggling.

680
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:13,439
It was like, scratch your head, like, what is he talking about?

681
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:17,279
He's saying he believes God, but then he's saying over here, well, no, actually God can't

682
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,719
do that, and you have to kind of step in and do this.

683
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,239
Like, we have to help God.

684
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,199
Are God's able to do all things?

685
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,959
Yes, he uses his people, and I'm thankful that he uses us, but the reality is that faith,

686
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:34,239
as we live by faith, we believe the impossible.

687
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:40,119
Notice as the text would now turn to Genesis chapter number 22, we find that we began in

688
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,999
Genesis chapter number 11 and 12 with the call of Abram.

689
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:48,199
We go and fast forward to Genesis chapter number 21 with the birth of Isaac, and now

690
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:53,479
if we were to look at what the writer of Hebrews is referring to in verses 17 through 19, we

691
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:58,679
would find that this is the record that is provided for us in Genesis 22.

692
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,599
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 17, by faith, Abraham.

693
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,679
Now you notice that it's once again based upon the faith of Abraham, the fact that he

694
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,159
believed God, he exercised faith.

695
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:25,019
It says this, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises

696
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,199
offered up his only begotten son.

697
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:37,439
Look at verse 18, of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called, a reference

698
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,039
back to the promise of God in Genesis chapter 21.

699
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,159
And I think about what God is recording for us here in Hebrews 11, verses 17 and 18, we'll

700
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,959
look at verse 19 again in just a moment, but I want you to understand that Abraham received

701
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:56,059
direction from the Lord, and he responded in obedience.

702
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:00,959
We find that as Abraham received, as you look back in Genesis chapter number 22, and as

703
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:07,119
God expressly spoke to Abraham in this passage of Scripture, it says in verse number 1 of

704
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,559
Genesis 22, and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham, or prove

705
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,959
him, or test him, and said unto him, Abraham, and he said, behold, here I am.

706
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:23,559
And God says, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee

707
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,079
into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains,

708
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,559
which I will tell thee of.

709
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,199
That's the instruction, the direction.

710
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,319
And in verse number 3, the Bible says that Abraham rose up early in the morning, he saddled

711
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:44,079
his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claimed the wood

712
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:52,079
for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went into the place of which God had told him.

713
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,899
I said this for our point of this portion of Hebrews 11, that living by faith believes

714
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,399
the impossible.

715
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,319
You know that when you begin to see God work, when you live by faith, when you're on that

716
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,799
faith journey, and as you're walking with God and you see God work, it increases your

717
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,079
faith.

718
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:16,879
You know, it was, humanly speaking, impossible for Abraham and Sarah to have a son.

719
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,879
Yet, God did what He said He was going to do.

720
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:25,359
And God had given him a promise, you notice in verse number 18, of whom it was said that

721
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,679
in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

722
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:36,479
We find that it is important that we resist the temptation in our lives to lean on our

723
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:39,639
own understanding.

724
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:45,999
That we resist in our lives the worldly counsel, the temporal counsel that some might try to

725
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:51,159
offer us, and that we would have our eyes upon our Lord and that we would live by faith.

726
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,479
And when I mention here that living by faith believes the impossible, I want you to see

727
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,839
what the Bible tells us in verse number 19.

728
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,839
See, by faith Abraham, he went and he offered up Isaac, and we find that in verse number

729
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,959
19, notice what it says, accounting that God was able.

730
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:14,079
Now just pause there just for a moment, I know it's not a period, a comma, nothing,

731
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,879
but just pause there for a moment.

732
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,199
Do you believe that God is able?

733
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,839
Accounting that God was able.

734
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,759
Now we understand that as we look through the portions of Scripture that we've studied

735
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:35,359
and we begin to think about the Word of God as a whole, and we find that we believe that

736
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,959
God is able, is able to do the impossible.

737
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:54,159
And here the Bible says, accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead.

738
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,159
And whence also he received him in a figure.

739
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:05,159
Let me ask you, has Abraham ever seen anyone raised from the dead?

740
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,799
Not that we're aware of.

741
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:13,159
Not that's recorded in the Word of God.

742
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,439
We find that during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, there were a few people

743
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,359
that were raised from the dead.

744
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,599
We find that during the ministry of Elijah and Elisha, there were some folks raised from

745
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,599
the dead.

746
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:27,639
But you understand that for Abraham, there's not been one raised from the dead.

747
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,279
He doesn't have anything to look back to and say, well God, you did it then, and so you

748
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,279
could do it again.

749
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:35,319
No, no, he just believed God.

750
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:41,539
He said, God gave me this promise about my son, and now God who gave me that son is telling

751
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,799
me to offer him up, and so I just believe that if I do what God told me to do, that

752
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,279
God's able to raise him again.

753
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,719
You say, man, that's faith.

754
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,719
Yes.

755
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,079
And I want you to think about Abraham.

756
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,279
I know that it's not contained here in the passage of Scripture, but if you were with

757
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:59,839
us on Sunday evening a few weeks ago as we studied the twelfth chapter of the book of

758
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,519
Genesis, I want to remind you of what happened in the twelfth chapter of Genesis.

759
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,959
By the way, it will happen again in our study of the life of Abraham and his life when he

760
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:15,319
tells Sarah, tell him you're my sister.

761
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,799
And I want you to think about Abraham in Genesis chapter number 12 versus Abraham in Genesis

762
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:21,199
chapter number 22.

763
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:26,959
In Genesis chapter number 12, Abraham is just arriving to Canaan.

764
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:32,719
He's just arrived to that place where God had led him to, and we find that Abraham is

765
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,999
now faced with this terrible situation.

766
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,879
There's a famine in the land.

767
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:43,079
The Bible tells us that it's a grievous famine, and he goes to Egypt, and no doubt he knew

768
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,079
some things.

769
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,999
He's aware of some things because he had this understanding that Sarah, you're beautiful.

770
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,159
You're my wife, and you're beautiful, and we're going to go there, and they're going

771
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:54,839
to take you, and they're going to kill me because you're so beautiful.

772
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,119
And so here's what I want you to do.

773
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,919
Tell them that you're my sister, and here's what I want you to think about.

774
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,479
As we looked at that passage of Scripture as we studied a few weeks ago, we said this

775
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:11,039
in Genesis chapter number 12, that God worked miraculously.

776
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,079
God demonstrated his power.

777
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:22,039
God plagued Pharaoh in his house because Sarai, at the time, she was taken, and God

778
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:27,599
prevented them from doing anything to her.

779
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,959
And what does Pharaoh do?

780
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,839
He calls Abraham and he says, why'd you do this?

781
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,519
Take your wife and go, and he commands all the other people to leave him alone.

782
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,199
God worked.

783
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,519
And so I would submit to you that in Genesis chapter number 12, Abraham didn't have the

784
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,839
same level of faith that he had in Genesis chapter 22.

785
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:51,159
In Genesis chapter number 22, there was some growth in Abraham's life.

786
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,519
There were some experiences.

787
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,519
There were some promises.

788
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,999
There were some demonstrations of God's power.

789
00:37:55,999 --> 00:38:00,399
No doubt, even that event that is mentioned in Genesis chapter number 12, that would develop

790
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:05,519
the faith of Abraham so that when God said, get up into Moriah and offer your son, he

791
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,999
says, all right, then I know that you could raise him up because you're God.

792
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,279
That's the kind of faith we need to have.

793
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:17,519
Can I tell you, you might not have that level of faith this morning, but God will work in

794
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,319
your life to develop that faith so that you believe the impossible.

795
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,319
I think about Gideon.

796
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,799
Gideon didn't believe when the Spirit of God, when the angel appeared to Gideon and said,

797
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:31,839
oh, thou great man of valor, right?

798
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,279
He's like, who are you talking to?

799
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,279
I mean, I'm the least of my father's house, right?

800
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:39,279
Isn't that what Gideon says?

801
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,479
What does God do?

802
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:43,440
He gives him some faith builders.

803
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,760
He goes through the process of let it be wet over here and dry over here.

804
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,239
Now let it be dry over there and wet over here, and he goes through this whole thing.

805
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,799
And then he's still not ready.

806
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:57,959
And so God says to Gideon, go listen to this conversation over here.

807
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:02,320
And there's a lot of passages there in Judges that record this, so I'm going real fast.

808
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,359
But you understand that God then says, go over and listen to this conversation.

809
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,599
And he listens to the conversation and the man says, this is none other than the sword

810
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,599
of the Lord and of Gideon.

811
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,440
And Gideon, all of a sudden, he has enough faith to go and do what God told him to do.

812
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,159
God was building his faith.

813
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,799
And God wants to build your faith.

814
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:21,559
God wants to build my faith.

815
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,760
He wants us to come to the place where we believe him.

816
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,359
I think about the passage that I preached on Sunday evening, excuse me, on Wednesday

817
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:35,199
evening, this past Wednesday, dealing with the man that brought his son to the disciples.

818
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,159
And the disciples could not cast out that demon.

819
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,959
And Jesus, of course, has that interaction with that man.

820
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:48,479
And he says, Jesus says, if thou canst believe, all things are possible.

821
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,519
Wow, what a great truth.

822
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,919
What does the man say?

823
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:57,959
I believe, help thou mine unbelief.

824
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:00,119
This morning we might be in that situation.

825
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,579
Lord, I believe, but I want You to help me to believe more.

826
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,699
I want You to increase my faith.

827
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:08,279
Help me to believe the impossible,

828
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:11,399
that God, You are able."

829
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,439
See, that's what we see here.

830
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:15,979
As Abraham lived by faith,

831
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,899
he believed the impossible.

832
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:22,079
He accounted that God was able to raise him up,

833
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,839
even from the dead,

834
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,039
from whence also He received him in a figure.

835
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,799
We understand as we look at all of the Scripture

836
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:35,479
and consider the picture of Abraham and Isaac,

837
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:38,019
and even as Isaac and Abraham were walking up the mountain,

838
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,479
and Isaac says, hey, where's the offering?

839
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,639
And he says, God will provide.

840
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,939
And God did provide.

841
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:46,199
And what a blessing that is,

842
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,899
and what a great picture of the fact

843
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:49,639
that God would send forth His Son,

844
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,679
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

845
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,959
to become the Lamb of God

846
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,759
that would take away the sin of the world.

847
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:57,679
That He would go to the cross of Calvary.

848
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,919
That He would suffer, bleed, and die.

849
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,719
That He would be buried in a borrowed tomb

850
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:05,559
and rise conquering sin, death, and the grave.

851
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:08,199
What a great picture.

852
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,839
This morning, we find that Abraham,

853
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,559
as he walked with the Lord,

854
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,959
that it began with a submission,

855
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:18,319
a daily submission to the direction of God,

856
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,279
that we just obey God.

857
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,839
We find that it then continues

858
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,679
with embracing the promises of God.

859
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,999
I'm going to believe that God's going to do

860
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,239
what He says He's going to do.

861
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,799
And as I embrace those promises,

862
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,279
it impacts my perspective.

863
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,999
It changes my perspective.

864
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:35,279
It gives me that eternal perspective.

865
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:38,799
Living by faith believes the impossible.

866
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,119
In closing this morning,

867
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,119
as we look at the next few verses

868
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,199
in verses 20-22,

869
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,439
I find this, number 4 in your notes,

870
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:52,919
living by faith influences future generations.

871
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:56,279
Living by faith influences future generations.

872
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,319
We find that there's a generational influence

873
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,799
that is recorded in these three verses of Scripture.

874
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:01,879
And I wonder this morning,

875
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,679
as we begin to think about

876
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,199
the way in which we would influence

877
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,079
those that would come behind us,

878
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,399
I wonder this morning,

879
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:11,440
what is it that we're giving the next generation?

880
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,879
I understand that there are many times

881
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,879
in which there's discussion that takes place

882
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:17,799
as to how we're going to lay up something

883
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,119
for a future generation,

884
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,759
some possession, some monetary whatever it might be,

885
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,440
but the reality is that one of the greatest things

886
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,720
that I can give to my children is a godly heritage.

887
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,279
One of the greatest things that I can give to my children

888
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,839
and seek to pass on to them

889
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:35,279
is the faith that was once delivered to me.

890
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,479
That I would teach them through my own life

891
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,360
how to live by faith.

892
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,639
To believe God.

893
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,199
And I submit to you this morning

894
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,279
that there is a generation

895
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:50,279
that desperately needs to see us live by faith.

896
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,639
They need to know that our God is real.

897
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,839
Amen?

898
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,959
And I wonder this morning,

899
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:59,799
how many of the next generation,

900
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:03,239
by our own testimony, by our own example,

901
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,919
believe that God is real?

902
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:09,039
Believe that our God is able to do the impossible?

903
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,679
Have we demonstrated that to them?

904
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,639
Have they seen us live by faith?

905
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,720
Have they watched us walk with God

906
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,159
and trust God and believe God?

907
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,799
They need to know that our God is real.

908
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,919
This isn't just the religion of my father.

909
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:25,239
Amen?

910
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,000
This relationship with the God of the universe

911
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,639
who is able.

912
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,959
And we find this morning,

913
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,279
listen, why is it that there's a generation

914
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,119
that's falling away?

915
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,519
Why is it that there's a generation

916
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,479
that's leaving the church?

917
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:38,959
Why is it that there's a generation

918
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:41,839
that's not following with the Lord

919
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:42,959
and walking with the Lord?

920
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:45,759
Where has it broken down?

921
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,119
And I find here this morning

922
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,519
that as we live by faith,

923
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,080
that we have the opportunity

924
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:54,440
to influence a future generation.

925
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,599
Notice with me in verse number 20,

926
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,360
the Bible says, by faith, Isaac.

927
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,759
We know that Isaac is the son of Abraham.

928
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:07,759
And it says here that Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.

929
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,000
Notice what it says concerning things to come.

930
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,720
Now, you'll be mindful of the passage of Scripture

931
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
that is referenced here.

932
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,000
It's Genesis chapter number 27.

933
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,959
And as you would have some Bible understanding

934
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,160
and knowledge, you'd understand

935
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,320
that Isaac gave some instruction

936
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,919
and he sought to bless who?

937
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:28,839
Esau, right?

938
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,519
That's who Isaac wanted to bless, Esau.

939
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,600
He told Esau to go and prepare this meal.

940
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,720
And we find that the Bible would record for us

941
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,040
how that Jacob then enters into his presence.

942
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,679
And Isaac is like, how did you come so quickly?

943
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,040
And so on and so forth.

944
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,399
And again, I'm just quickly summarizing the passage.

945
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:47,119
Go back and read all of Genesis 27

946
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,679
and you can see what took place.

947
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,720
But you find that Isaac had some doubt, did he not?

948
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,479
Come close to me.

949
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:59,639
He felt him and he said he's hairy.

950
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,000
And we look at the passage and we begin to think,

951
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and some have questioned the validity

952
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,679
of verse number 20 in Hebrews chapter number 11

953
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,760
and have said, no, he didn't do it by faith

954
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,959
because he thought he was blessing Esau, not Jacob.

955
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:15,519
I beg to differ.

956
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,839
Because I believe that the faith

957
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,760
that God is speaking of here

958
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,959
with regard to the faith that Isaac was exercising

959
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:29,720
was faith not in who he was blessing, but in the blessing.

960
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,199
Notice what it says, concerning things to come.

961
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,119
His faith was in the promise that God had given.

962
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,079
Remember back in verse number nine,

963
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,260
it says that Abraham, he was in a strange country

964
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,739
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob,

965
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:51,059
the heirs with him of the same promise.

966
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:54,299
And we find that as Isaac would bless Jacob,

967
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,100
and yes, there was a blessing for Esau.

968
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,859
Remember right after Jacob left, Esau comes in

969
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,660
and he's like, all right, here you go, I'm ready.

970
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,739
And it didn't work out so well.

971
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,859
Esau was pretty upset, was he not?

972
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:08,459
Determined that he was gonna kill his brother, by the way.

973
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:11,299
And there's a great reunion, by the way,

974
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:13,859
in the word of God between Jacob and Esau.

975
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:16,779
What a precious, precious passage of scripture it is.

976
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:18,540
I believe it's Genesis 33.

977
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,619
And you look here at the passage and you find here

978
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,979
that he, Isaac, had faith regarding those things,

979
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:29,320
concerning things to come.

980
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:35,139
Again, that perspective that we found in verse number 13,

981
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,899
not having received the promises,

982
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:40,019
but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them

983
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:42,859
and embraced them.

984
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,820
Verse 21, so really as we look at verse 20,

985
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,339
the blessing of Isaac,

986
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,699
we'd look at that as being an individual aspect.

987
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:55,339
Look at verse 21, by faith, Jacob, when he was a dying,

988
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,859
blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship

989
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:01,019
leaning upon the top of his staff.

990
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,779
This portion of scripture really is looking at that

991
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,079
which is recorded in Genesis chapter 48,

992
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,779
verses 11 through 22.

993
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:10,100
And then we understand that all of his sons

994
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,059
would then receive a blessing and a direction

995
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:15,779
in Genesis chapter number 49 before his death.

996
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:18,660
Now, it's interesting that Jacob being mentioned here,

997
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,100
it says when he was a dying,

998
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,220
he blessed both the sons of Joseph.

999
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:27,019
Now remember, he thought Joseph was dead, right?

1000
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,139
The brothers, they hated Joseph,

1001
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:30,260
they were gonna kill Joseph,

1002
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,100
but then they figured that they could sell him

1003
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,660
and he went into Egypt and he was there.

1004
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,699
And of course, we understand there were a number of things

1005
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:40,339
that God was working and how God was working.

1006
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,380
There was a great famine.

1007
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,540
Remember, there was a dream, Pharaoh had a dream.

1008
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,979
And of course, Joseph interprets that dream

1009
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:50,100
and that famine not only impacted Egypt,

1010
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,019
but it also impacted Canaan.

1011
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,820
They had no food, so they sent.

1012
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,820
And Joseph is there as second command of all of Egypt.

1013
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,199
And we find on the second visit

1014
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:03,919
that he revealed his identity to his brothers.

1015
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,579
And you remember when they came back

1016
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,940
and they told dad that Joseph was alive

1017
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,739
and Jacob was excited.

1018
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:17,739
I mean, he was thrilled to find out that his son was alive.

1019
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:21,299
And we find that before he would leave Canaan land,

1020
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:26,299
that he pauses there and God gives him a great promise.

1021
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,339
And it's important that we'd understand

1022
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,059
that as God would appear to Jacob here

1023
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:38,059
in chapter number 46, sorry, yeah, chapter number 46,

1024
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,700
we find that in Genesis chapter number 46,

1025
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,260
that God spake unto Israel in visions of the night

1026
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,619
and said, Jacob, Jacob, and he said, here am I.

1027
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:48,140
In verse number three, God says this to Jacob.

1028
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,339
He says, I am God, the God of thy father.

1029
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:53,219
Fear not to go down into Egypt,

1030
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:56,260
for I will there make of thee a great nation.

1031
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,419
I will go down with thee into Egypt

1032
00:48:58,419 --> 00:49:00,979
and I will also surely bring thee up again

1033
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,700
and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

1034
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,659
See, Jacob was in the land that God had promised,

1035
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:10,900
but he's gonna leave that land and go to Egypt.

1036
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,099
And God says to Jacob, fear not to go down into Egypt,

1037
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:16,940
for there in that place,

1038
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,219
I'm going to make of thee a great nation.

1039
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:22,339
And he not only tells him that he's gonna go with him

1040
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,299
down into Egypt,

1041
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:27,580
but he says that I will surely bring thee up again.

1042
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,219
We find that as Jacob would bless the sons of Joseph

1043
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,900
in Genesis chapter 48,

1044
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,460
we find that Jacob says to Joseph,

1045
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,059
I had not in verse number 11 thought to see thy face

1046
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,619
and lo, God hath showed me also thy seed.

1047
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:45,659
Can see an excited man, a rejoicing man.

1048
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:47,260
And he makes this blessing

1049
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,979
and you can read the entirety of it

1050
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:53,419
in verses 11 through 22 of Genesis chapter 48.

1051
00:49:53,419 --> 00:49:57,020
Again, the faith is in what God had promised

1052
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,179
and how God had given His Word.

1053
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:04,139
And really, if we look at Isaac's blessing as being an individual blessing,

1054
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,679
we'd look at Jacob's blessing as being a tribal blessing.

1055
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,059
He's thinking about all of the nation of Israel, if you will,

1056
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:13,099
and the individual tribes that are mentioned.

1057
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:17,799
And then we come to the last verse of our passage for this morning,

1058
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:20,559
Hebrews 11 and verse number 22.

1059
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,059
Hebrews 11 and verse number 22.

1060
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:27,299
The Bible now speaks of the faith of Joseph.

1061
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:29,599
I want you to think about the generational influence

1062
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,219
that we're speaking about here, as we live by faith,

1063
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:36,059
we have the opportunity to influence future generations.

1064
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,019
Abraham lived by faith.

1065
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:42,479
And the Bible says, by faith, Isaac, his son, by faith, Jacob, his grandson,

1066
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:45,479
by faith, Joseph, his great-great-grandson.

1067
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:50,319
Notice what it says, when he died, the end of Genesis chapter number 50,

1068
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,739
made mention of the departing of the children of Israel

1069
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:58,819
and gave commandment concerning his bones.

1070
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:03,239
He made mention, it says, of the departing of the children of Israel.

1071
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,999
We understand, as we read the book of Exodus,

1072
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:07,619
that there rose up another pharaoh that did not know Joseph.

1073
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,579
And there was a period of heartache for the nation of Israel

1074
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:12,699
and difficulty in slavery,

1075
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:16,039
and they had all sorts of difficulties that they endured.

1076
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,239
But God said, I've heard your cry, I've seen your affliction,

1077
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:23,159
and he sent Moses, and Moses would be the human person

1078
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,239
that God would use to provide deliverance for the nation of Israel.

1079
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,999
And as we look at Joseph here and we look at the faith and what he is saying,

1080
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:36,739
again, he's looking to the future, he's believing, embracing the promises of God.

1081
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:41,779
God's going to let the nation of Israel depart from this land.

1082
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:43,619
He believed what God had said.

1083
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,779
And then he made mention, commandment concerning his bones.

1084
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:50,619
It's interesting, if you'd go in Genesis chapter number 50,

1085
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:53,619
and you see in that passage of Scripture in verses 24 and 25

1086
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:56,919
is what is referenced here in Hebrews 11 and verse 22,

1087
00:51:56,919 --> 00:51:59,379
it says that Joseph said unto his brethren, I die,

1088
00:51:59,379 --> 00:52:03,379
and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land,

1089
00:52:03,379 --> 00:52:06,759
unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

1090
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:08,959
And Joseph took an oath to the children of Israel saying,

1091
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:15,000
God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

1092
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,879
Did God do what he said? Absolutely.

1093
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:20,459
God visited his people, God delivered his people.

1094
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:26,179
You know what the Bible records for us in Joshua chapter 24 and verse number 32?

1095
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:31,099
Years and years later, it says that the bones of Joseph,

1096
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,059
which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt,

1097
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:37,219
buried them in Shechem, a parcel of ground,

1098
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:41,139
which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem,

1099
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:42,479
for a hundred pieces of silver,

1100
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:46,599
and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

1101
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,299
Can I tell you this morning that living by faith pleases God?

1102
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:55,179
Without faith, it's impossible to please him.

1103
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:59,179
Begin to think about these that are mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11,

1104
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,639
and we have now looked at this length,

1105
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,939
really the longest portion of Scripture in Hebrews chapter 11,

1106
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:09,339
devoted to Abraham, and of course, these descendants of Abraham,

1107
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:11,939
and thinking of the generational influence.

1108
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,939
And this morning, God wants us to live by faith.

1109
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,759
He just wants us to believe him,

1110
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:20,759
to believe that he will do what he said he will do.

1111
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,839
Now, we can look back,

1112
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:27,059
and we can see how that what they did not receive,

1113
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,099
we can see how God blessed and what God did.

1114
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,559
We have the privilege of being on this side of history

1115
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,139
and being able to look back.

1116
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:38,299
In our lives, though, we still need to take God at his Word,

1117
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,919
and believe God, and walk with God,

1118
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,879
and daily submit to the direction of God,

1119
00:53:42,879 --> 00:53:46,179
and embrace the promises of God.

1120
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:49,839
And we believe the impossible that God is able.

1121
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,759
He's able to do all things.

1122
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:54,259
And as we live by faith,

1123
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:57,719
we have the opportunity to influence a future generation.

1124
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,759
Can I tell you it's the greatest way that we could influence the next generation?

1125
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:04,879
To believe God.

1126
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:06,719
To believe God.

1127
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,219
That this next generation that's represented by the young people in our church,

1128
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:12,719
that they would do far greater than what we could even do.

1129
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,220
Why? Because we have instilled in them at a young age to believe God.

1130
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:22,299
To just in simple childlike faith, believe God.

1131
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:25,299
God said it, that settles it.

1132
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:26,799
Right?

1133
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,880
I know I've mentioned it many times.

1134
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,419
That old bumper sticker that says,

1135
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:32,419
God said it, I believe it, that settles it.

1136
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:34,880
I don't care if you believe it or not.

1137
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,519
If God said it, that settles it.

1138
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:39,639
It's good that you believe it,

1139
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:44,139
but we understand this morning that what God has said, God will do.

1140
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,919
And oh, that we would live by faith.

1141
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That we would have the opportunity to influence this next generation.

1142
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,720
Not necessarily with some possessions and some things,

1143
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,299
but most importantly, with a faith that believes God.

1144
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:07,880
That they would learn.

1145
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,339
One thing I'd say about my parents,

1146
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,799
one thing I'd say about those folks in our church.

1147
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:16,179
Some of you don't have children, but yet you're still influencing people.

1148
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,100
You're still influencing the young people in our church.

1149
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,559
Oh, that our young people would look at you and say,

1150
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,100
one thing I could say about them is they believe God.

1151
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,899
They just take God at His word.

1152
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:28,179
And it's a living faith.

1153
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:31,720
It's a visible faith.

1154
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,100
Living by faith.

1155
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,519
Let's pray.

1156
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:34,979
Father, we love you.

1157
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:38,059
We thank you so much for loving us.

1158
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:41,979
We thank you for the privilege of having your word

1159
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:45,359
in the examples of those that have gone before us.

1160
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:51,739
And I pray this morning that you would help us to carry the baton, so to speak.

1161
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:54,279
To continue to live by faith.

1162
00:55:54,279 --> 00:56:00,899
That you might give us the opportunity to influence a future generation.

1163
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,899
Father, that you would help us to embrace the promises

1164
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:05,119
that you've given us in your word.

1165
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:12,859
Understanding that as we do so, our perspective will be greatly changed.

1166
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:16,199
As we think of the songwriter that said as we turn our eyes upon Jesus

1167
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:20,440
that the things of this world grow strangely dim.

1168
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,279
All of a sudden, those things that matter most to our neighbors

1169
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:28,779
and maybe our co-workers, matter little to us.

1170
00:56:28,779 --> 00:56:34,619
Because we have an eternal perspective, a heavenly perspective.

1171
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,679
Help us to live by faith.

1172
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:40,119
Help us to believe you.

1173
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,119
There's one that's not sure of heaven.

1174
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:46,699
I pray this morning that they would understand their need for Christ.

1175
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:53,500
That there is a heaven, there is a lake of fire, there is an eternity.

1176
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,839
There's only one Savior, that's the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

1177
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:02,660
And if they've never placed their faith and trust in the finished work of Calvary

1178
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,079
and accepted the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

1179
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,419
I pray that today, they would be saved.

1180
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:14,059
Lord, for each of us that have confessed the Lord Jesus Christ,

1181
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,720
that we know you as our Lord and Savior,

1182
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,479
oh God, would you help us to live by faith.

1183
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,859
Increase our faith.

1184
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,899
As you did in the lives of those that have gone before us.

1185
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,699
Help us to believe you.

1186
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,299
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1187
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:32,079
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1188
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,739
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

1189
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:35,899
As she does, the altar's open.

1190
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:38,639
Feel free to make your pew an altar.

1191
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,440
But let God have his way in your life.

1192
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,639
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
