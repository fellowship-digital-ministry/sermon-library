WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
And now looking at this 11th chapter and this will be our third lesson from Hebrews chapter 11

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.619
And we look forward to dealing with verses 8 through 22 this morning and last week

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.040
We looked at verses 4 through 7. We dealt with the subject matter of living by faith

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.899
We entitled it living by faith part 1 and we looked at three individuals Abel

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.479
We looked at the worship of Abel

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.479
We looked at the walk of Enoch and the work of Noah

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.559
This morning as we look at verses 8 through 22

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.119
Primarily be dealing with the life of Abraham and we are reminded of the great faith of this individual

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:42.799
Of course a great patriarch a man that as we have mentioned throughout the the weeks of study

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.799
And of course various other portions of scripture that we've studied as well

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:51.400
We have discussed the influence of Abraham and how he is held in high regard

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.319
By the Jewish people and this chapter devotes much space to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:58.400
the life of Abraham

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.119
In fact as we get in verse number 8 you begin looking at the truth of

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:09.000
Genesis chapter 11 and chapter 12 and the call of Abram as you move through the passage of scripture by the time you come down

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.879
To verse number 19 and 20 and and look at what's going on there

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:20.760
You find the influence upon future generations and how that Abraham lived by faith and had the opportunity to influence

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.480
His offspring and of course in verse number 19 really 17 through 19 dealing with the events in Genesis 22

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.400
And so very thankful for the opportunity to look at this passage of scripture

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.360
And I'm reminded of a conversation that the Lord Jesus Christ had with the religious leaders

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:43.000
During his earthly ministry there in John chapter number 8 and as he's having this discussion with these

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:50.040
Religious leaders of the day the the the name Abraham comes up in the discussion and many times they refer to Abraham

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040
And what have you and it's amazing what the Lord Jesus Christ declares to us often

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.639
We speak about John 8 in verse number 58 when he says before Abraham was I am and what great truth that is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.519
But in verse number 56 of John chapter number 8

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.080
Jesus said this Abraham

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.320
rejoiced to see my day and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.080
He saw it and was glad we think about that

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.160
Declaration that Jesus made in John 8 in verse number 56

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.860
We see that Abraham saw it by faith and as we examine this passage of scripture this morning

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.399
We're going to learn more about what it means to live by faith

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.360
we understand that the believers that are being written to here in the book of Hebrews that they are

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.360
given the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.399
challenge to

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.520
Continue and to go on and to live by faith

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.720
In fact as you ended the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews you find that he quotes from

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.080
That Old Testament passage in Habakkuk that the just shall live

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.160
By faith and we today are called to live by faith

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.839
And we understand that the passage here in Hebrews 11 says without faith

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:05.119
It is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:11.440
Rewarder of them that diligently seek him and so are thankful for the opportunity to live by faith

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.399
I am often reminded as I read Hebrews chapter 11 that as we read about these

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.160
Individuals and their great testimony and how they lived by faith and what they were able to see God

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:27.119
Accomplish I'm reminded of this. They really didn't have any example to look to

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.559
We

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.000
Have so many examples to look to we have not only those that are contained within the Word of God the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.320
The great list that is provided for us here in Hebrews 11

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.000
But those that have gone before us

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.199
in church history that have lived by faith that we can look to their lives and we can see examples of

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.399
Living by faith and how God blesses and how God always does what he says

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.880
He will do yet when we look at this list of folks that are mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.440
I ask you who did they have to look to what book of record did they have to look to know they believed God?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.839
They trust it God and they lived by faith

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:12.399
This morning we have many examples and we're so thankful for them as we dig in to the passage of Scripture

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:18.239
I want you to see in verses 8 through 10 if you're taking notes this morning number one living by faith requires

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.399
daily submission

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.399
to God's direction

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.359
Living by faith requires daily submission to God's direction. Are we going to obey God or not?

00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:31.160
Look at it in verse 8 by faith Abraham

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.000
When he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:41.359
Obeyed look at the end of verse number 8 and he went out

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.559
Not knowing with her he went

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.200
By faith he sojourned in the land of promises in a strange country

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:56.839
Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.920
Which has foundations whose builder and maker is God?

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.640
As we think about these first few verses we study this passage this morning

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.079
we find that Abraham was a man that submitted to the direction of God and as we live by faith as we

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.559
Are going to obey the command that God has given us in his word that the just shall live

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.640
By faith that we must come to the place that we are submitting to the direction that God gives in his leadership in our lives

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.239
We sing songs about following the Lord. We sing songs about where he leads me

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:37.160
I will go and we sing about those truths and it's wonderful to be reminded of that Bible truth through song

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:43.839
But this morning as we think about the leadership of God in the direction of God, we find that God is faithful to provide it

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.760
God is faithful to provide direction and

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:51.000
Abraham he went out he obeyed he went out not knowing with her

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.839
He went the Bible tells us that he sojourned notice how it's referred to in the land of promise as in a strange

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.920
country dwelling in tabernacles

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:03.239
you think about the

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.480
Phraseology there and thinking about tents and he's dwelling

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.959
There in something that is not a permanent structure in a land that has been promised

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.279
It's interesting what Stephen says while he's preaching in Acts chapter number seven

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.200
You don't need to turn over there

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.119
But next seven we find that the sermon of Stephen really begins

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:27.440
With the call of Abraham as you look in Acts chapter number seven you find in verse number two

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.440
That's exactly where he begins his message

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:35.640
It begins to speak about Abraham and he says this of Abraham in verse number five and he gave him none

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.119
Inheritance in it. No, not so much as to set his foot on

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:48.119
Yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.119
Had no child

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.760
We find that even in our Sunday evening series as we've been going through the book of Genesis

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.779
And we've been in that section dealing with the life of Abraham and all that God is showing us

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.920
In as he follows as Abraham follows the Lord we find here this reminder that we are to live by faith

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.760
And if we live by faith, we must submit to the direction of God

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:20.160
see because submitting to the direction of God is living by faith and we find that as I

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:28.920
Hear the the voice of God as I follow the direction of the Lord in my life. That obedience is based upon faith

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.440
We sing the song trust and obey we trust him because he's trustworthy

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.279
We obey him because it's appropriate for us to do so and we find that faith is necessary

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.519
We look at the the passage and we see the obedience

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:49.320
We see that he sojourned in verse number nine notice in verse number ten that he looked for a city which has foundations

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.920
Whose builder and maker is God now?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.640
We've studied Genesis 11 and 12 and 13 and we've discussed those passages of scripture over the last several

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.739
Sunday evenings and as we've studied those passages of scripture, we've noticed how that Abraham

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:13.600
Journeyed and how that he followed the direction of the Lord and here this morning as we would understand in our lives

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.600
What's God's direction for us?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.399
Well, how is God leading us as we would look to the Word of God and seek the face of God?

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:27.600
I've often said to young people as we would think about their lives and think about the plans that they have for their lives

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:33.599
So often the question is asked of young people. What do you want to do with your life a

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.840
Far better question is what does God want to do with your life?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.559
Are you willing to submit to the direction of God in your life?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:48.719
Are you willing to go where God would call are you willing to do what God has called you to do?

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:51.880
Are we willing to follow the direction of the Lord?

00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:57.359
We find that faith requires that we would daily submit to the direction of God

00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:03.119
And and I think about the the emphasis that I worded it that way on purpose because it's a daily submission

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.679
It's a daily

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:08.359
following the Lord Jesus Christ and having

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.900
That truth of his direction before us and we would follow his voice

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.679
Notice that living by faith as we continue to move through the passage of scripture in verses 11 through 16 living by faith

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:25.320
Embraces the promises of God we sang this morning standing on the promises

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.159
I didn't select the song Dean picks the songs and I did not request that song

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:35.280
But how appropriate that song is for the passage of scripture that is before us this morning

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.000
And I think about the promises of God and I think about the way in which faith

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.479
Requires that we would embrace the promises of God

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:46.640
We have the whole Word of God

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.039
I'm so thankful this morning that we have the complete canon of scripture that we can

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:56.840
Go to the Word of God and we can read of his promises and we can be encouraged and strengthened

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.039
But the reality is that we understand the

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.239
the importance of embracing these promises,

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:03.959
believing them,

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.119
saying as Paul said in Acts 27,

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:13.119
I believe God that it shall be as He said.

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:15.119
We come to this passage of Scripture

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:16.739
and we think about the promises

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:18.439
that were given to Abraham

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:20.439
and we would boil them down to two.

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:22.359
It was a land and it was a seed

00:10:22.359 --> 00:10:25.199
as we'd consider the aspect of those truths

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:27.239
and we would find that as we would embrace

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:29.239
the promises of God that we see here

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:31.679
in v. 11 that Sarah is mentioned,

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.599
of course, the spouse of Abraham

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:37.319
and they had been promised a son.

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:40.479
That son would be the promise

00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:42.399
that God would give of the seed

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.239
and we find that in v. 11,

00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:46.239
the Bible says through faith also,

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:48.999
Sarah herself received strength

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:51.399
to conceive seed

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.239
and was delivered of a child

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:55.319
when she was past age

00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:57.719
because she judged Him faithful

00:10:57.719 --> 00:10:59.559
who had promised.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.599
We begin to think about the truth

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.399
of this verse of Scripture

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:04.799
and the faith of Sarah

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:07.199
and now we begin to see Abraham and Sarah

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.159
and we think about this faith journey

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.719
as being a family journey

00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:12.719
that we believe the promises of God

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.759
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:16.039
in v. 11 at the end

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.999
that she judged Him faithful

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.399
who had promised.

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.039
Now you understand that God had promised

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:24.439
this son for a number of years

00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:26.599
and God had restated the promise

00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:28.319
and yet there were some times,

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:30.679
remember, Sarah laughed the Bible tells us

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:32.719
and we find that Sarah said something

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:34.879
about Abraham going to Hagar

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:36.199
and we understand those things

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:38.679
as we'd study and read in the book of Genesis,

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:40.639
but we find that eventually,

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:43.159
Sarah came around and believed

00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:44.479
what God said.

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.639
Sarah understood that the promise

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.679
that God made that she judged Him faithful

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:50.719
who had promised.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:51.999
It's interesting to me

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:53.719
that as you read the book of Genesis

00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:55.919
and you go through the account of Scripture

00:11:55.959 --> 00:11:58.479
and you find that God says to Abraham,

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:00.559
why did Sarah laugh?

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.439
You ever wonder why God didn't ask Sarah

00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:03.799
why she laughed?

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:05.559
He asked Abraham.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.239
Abraham had been given the promise

00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:08.719
directly from God

00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:10.519
and Abraham had the responsibility

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:13.159
of sharing that promise with his wife

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:15.359
and influencing her and encouraging her

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.999
and helping to bring her along

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.359
in that faith journey

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:19.919
and we find that eventually,

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:21.319
she does come to that place

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:23.919
where she's believing the promise of God

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:25.879
and she counted, she judged

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:30.799
Him, God, faithful who had made the promise.

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:32.559
You know that promises

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:35.639
are only as good as the person that makes them.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.119
You think about that just for a moment.

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:38.959
Someone could make you a promise.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.599
They could promise you all sorts of things.

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.759
I remember when we were in Bible college,

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.999
the Bible college that I attended,

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:44.959
they were trying to raise money.

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.519
They were always trying to raise money.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.159
And they were trying to offset

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.359
some of the tuition costs

00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:50.519
and so on and so forth.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:53.879
And someone made this just a huge promise

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:55.439
of a donation.

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:57.679
I remember the faculty being excited

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.119
about this particular promise

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.159
and what have you.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:03.719
And we find that after a short period of time,

00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:06.999
there was absolutely no possibility

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:08.679
that this promise would be fulfilled

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:10.119
by the individual that made it

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:12.239
because they flat out didn't have it.

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:13.999
And as they were asked the question,

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:17.159
they said, well, if I get it, I'll give it.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:18.599
Kind of a situation.

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:20.839
And so they were hoping

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:23.599
and having some confidence in a promise

00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:25.199
that was just not gonna come to pass.

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:26.679
And I tell you this morning,

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.719
that the Lord God Almighty,

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:30.239
the God of heaven and earth,

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:32.239
the Creator of all things,

00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:34.679
He has given us some promises.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:36.079
And we can trust Him

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:38.959
and we must judge that He is faithful.

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.999
We must understand that God is not a man

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:43.279
that He should lie.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.519
We find this morning

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.439
that as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:49.239
that as God says to Abraham,

00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:51.839
is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.119
We would answer the question,

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:56.159
no, there's nothing too difficult for our God.

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:58.079
He's able to do, as Paul says,

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.919
exceeding abundantly above

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.519
all that we would ask or think.

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:04.519
And we find that she judged Him faithful

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.359
who had promised this morning.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.719
Are you standing on the promises?

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:11.599
We sang the song,

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:13.479
but are we really standing on the promises?

00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:15.639
Are we really believing

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:18.639
that God will do what He said He will do?

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.919
Are we really believing it?

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:22.239
Have we, look, as we go through the passage,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.799
we begin to see in verse number 13,

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.079
let me read verse 12 first.

00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:25.919
It says this,

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.119
therefore sprang there even of one

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.159
and him as good as dead,

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:32.599
speaking about Abraham

00:14:32.599 --> 00:14:35.599
and of course he was also past age

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:37.919
as we find that is mentioned of Sarah

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:38.799
in verse number 11.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:42.119
And it says so many as the stars of the sky in multitude

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:46.079
and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable.

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:48.719
You know that when you embrace the promises of God,

00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:51.879
you get to see God work miracles.

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:53.239
You get to see God work.

00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:55.399
You get to see God do something

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.559
that only God can do.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.759
I was reading this morning in my own personal devotions.

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:00.959
I was reading through the book of Acts

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:04.079
and as I came upon the miracle of Acts chapter number three

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:05.359
and Acts chapter number four,

00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:07.599
I was reminded again about the power of God

00:15:07.599 --> 00:15:11.039
and the miracle that was there recorded

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:11.919
in Acts chapter number three

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:13.719
of that lame man that was healed.

00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.439
And you find that in chapter number four

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:17.879
as they are questioning Peter and John,

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:19.279
they make the statement,

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.519
listen, we really can't deny it

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:24.919
because the guy is standing right here that was healed.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:26.879
And I love the passage of Scripture

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:29.639
because you find that Peter and John are being questioned

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:30.959
and standing right next to him

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:34.559
is the man that had laid lame at the gate beautiful.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.719
What are they gonna say?

00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:37.479
No, that didn't happen.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.599
John chapter number nine,

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:41.679
the man that was born blind that is healed by Jesus Christ,

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:44.239
we find that they say, no, no, no, he's not him,

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:45.799
but he's one like him.

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:48.039
And he says, I am him.

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:51.039
I was blind and now I see.

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:52.359
And we find this morning

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:54.479
that we serve a God of the impossible.

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:57.599
We serve a God that is able to do miracles.

00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:01.479
And we find this morning that he works miraculously

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:04.079
as we embrace the promises of God,

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.279
as we live by faith.

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.599
Look at verse 13 with me.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:10.199
These all died.

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.479
Notice what it says, in faith.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:18.959
But it says this, not having received the promises,

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:24.399
the fullness of the promise that had been made to Abraham

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.999
had not yet come to pass.

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:28.999
We find that when Abraham died,

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:32.239
as was mentioned in Acts 7 by Stephen in verse number five,

00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:34.999
he had no possession of the land.

00:16:34.999 --> 00:16:39.439
Save a plot of land for the burial of his wife.

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:41.679
If you look in Genesis, that's what you find.

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:44.919
They did not receive the promise as we would think,

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:47.639
but I want you to consider what is said in verse number 13,

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.399
coupled with the last statement of verse number nine,

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.719
when it says that he was dwelling in tabernacles

00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:57.239
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him,

00:16:57.239 --> 00:16:58.079
what does it say?

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:00.679
Of the same promise.

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:04.319
It continues in verse number 13 and says this,

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.639
but having seen them afar off,

00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:08.479
notice what it says,

00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:13.479
and were persuaded of them and embraced them

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.359
and confessed that they were strangers

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.399
and pilgrims on the earth.

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:21.839
We begin to think about this embracing,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.399
being persuaded of the promises

00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:25.479
and embracing the promises of God.

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:29.239
We find that God's timetable is not always our timetable.

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:31.639
There are things in which we look at the promises of God

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:33.719
and we begin to look at the Word of God and say,

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.159
it'd be okay if that would happen today.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.799
I'd be perfectly fine with you fulfilling that promise

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.519
in my life today, Lord,

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:42.359
but God's timing is not always our timing.

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:45.959
But let me say this, God's timing is always perfect.

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:47.799
Sometimes we get ahead of God.

00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:51.679
We find that God's never late.

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:52.559
He's never early.

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:53.919
He's always right on time.

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.839
When the fullness of time was come

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.279
is what Paul says in Galatians

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.119
with regard to the coming of our Savior,

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.479
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:04.519
And we find here that we are to receive these promises

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:06.279
and that we are to be persuaded of them

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.919
and we are to embrace them.

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.799
We find that it says at the end of the verse

00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:12.759
that they confess that they were strangers

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.319
and pilgrims on the earth.

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:17.199
It's an interesting phrase of Scripture

00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:19.679
and we're reminded of that song that we sing,

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:22.279
this world is not my home.

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:24.439
I'm just a passing through.

00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:26.959
This idea of being a stranger and pilgrim

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:31.279
carries with it the idea of being away from home,

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:33.079
but going home.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.079
Think about that.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:37.759
I'm away from home, but I'm going home.

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.759
This world is not my home.

00:18:40.399 --> 00:18:41.719
If you're saved this morning,

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.599
if Jesus Christ is your Savior,

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:47.440
we're looking not to nail down some stakes here

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.159
and have some level of permanence here.

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:50.000
Why?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.759
Because I'm just a stranger and a pilgrim.

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:54.639
I'm away from home, but I'm going home.

00:18:54.639 --> 00:18:57.759
And what a joy, what a blessing to understand that.

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:59.799
We find that he said in verse number 10

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.000
that he looked for a city which hath foundations,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.119
whose builder and maker is God.

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.880
And we begin to look at verses 14

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.839
and down through verse number 16

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:11.119
and begin to see that perspective that they have

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.519
with regard to eternity.

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:13.479
Notice it says this,

00:19:13.479 --> 00:19:14.959
for they that say such things

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:18.239
declare plainly that they seek a country.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.839
And truly, if they had been mindful of that country

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:24.000
from whence they came out,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.679
they might have had opportunity to have returned.

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:29.679
You understand that Abraham, as you look at his life,

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.639
yeah, there's some things you can look at and see.

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:33.079
Okay, he went down into Egypt

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.440
in Genesis chapter number 12, bad decision.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
You can look at those things.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.880
But you know, he never went back to the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.959
He didn't go back.

00:19:40.959 --> 00:19:42.599
He left that place.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:45.159
He left the idolatry of that place.

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:47.759
He left the culture of that place.

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:51.079
And he followed God and he was not looking to go back.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:54.599
And as God's people, we ought not desire to look back

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:56.279
or to go back to the world.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.759
The world has nothing for us.

00:19:58.759 --> 00:20:00.199
I'm in the world.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.239
but I'm not of the world.

00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:04.899
And we have to come to that understanding,

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:06.499
that realization in our lives.

00:20:06.499 --> 00:20:08.659
And we find that it says in v. 16,

00:20:08.659 --> 00:20:10.959
but now they desire,

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:11.959
notice what it says,

00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:13.759
a better country.

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:15.199
That is in heavenly,

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.779
wherefore God is not ashamed

00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:17.999
to be called their God,

00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:22.779
for He hath prepared for them a city.

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:25.099
Oh, what a wonderful truth.

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:26.419
We find that Jesus said,

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:28.099
if you turn over to the book of John

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:29.179
in v. 17,

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:31.779
we begin to see what Jesus is praying.

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:33.519
And this is really the Lord's Prayer

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:34.619
as it's recorded here.

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:37.119
Before, He would go to the cross of Calvary

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:38.779
and we find that He's seeking

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.339
to glorify His Father.

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.739
And He goes through the passage

00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:43.379
and He says right in the beginning,

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:45.899
the hour has come.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:48.539
And as Jesus is praying in John 17,

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.259
we find that in v. 15,

00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:53.779
He says, I pray not that thou shouldest

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:55.659
take them out of the world,

00:20:55.659 --> 00:20:58.259
but that thou shouldest keep them

00:20:58.259 --> 00:20:59.219
from the evil.

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:01.439
You understand that we live in an evil world.

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:02.839
You understand that the world,

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:03.959
the flesh, and the devil,

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:05.079
they're against us.

00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:07.479
We understand that the enemy is against us,

00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:09.419
but we find here that He says

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:11.819
that we would not be taken out of the world,

00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:14.179
but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:15.719
Notice what He says in v. 16,

00:21:15.719 --> 00:21:17.959
they are not of the world,

00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:22.339
even as I am not of the world.

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:24.559
Sanctify them through Thy truth.

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:27.799
Thy Word is truth.

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:30.199
They're strangers and pilgrims.

00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:31.699
See, I think about this truth

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:33.779
when we embrace the promises of God.

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:34.979
You know what it does?

00:21:34.979 --> 00:21:37.499
It impacts your perspective.

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:39.319
It changes your perspective.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:42.099
This world is not all there is.

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:45.039
By the way, if this world was all there was,

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.299
we'd live differently.

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:49.499
We'd understand the American dream

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:51.379
and pursuing it and get the biggest

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:53.259
and the best and all that we can.

00:21:53.259 --> 00:21:55.239
We'd understand that.

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:57.659
But this world is not all there is.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.719
This world is just temporary.

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:02.039
This world is going to burn

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.439
with a fervent heat

00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:04.959
is what the Bible tells us.

00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:06.559
And we find here this morning

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:09.279
that as we embrace the promises of God,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:11.459
it changes our perspective.

00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:13.079
I would submit to you this morning

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:16.759
that we need our perspective changed.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:18.059
Why? Because the world

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:19.759
and the marketing industry

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:22.519
is trying to influence our perspective

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:25.819
to think this is all there is.

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:27.399
You need the newest and the greatest

00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:29.359
and the best and this is going to last.

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:32.999
And we say, no, no, I'm going home.

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:34.839
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger.

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:36.339
I'm away from home.

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:38.319
But I'm going home. Amen?

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.859
And we find that he says here,

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.819
when we think about this perspective,

00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:43.459
I want you to consider Paul

00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:46.019
in 2 Corinthians 4.

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:47.099
The Apostle Paul,

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:50.039
oh, he had a heavenly perspective, did he not?

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:51.279
We find that Abraham,

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.499
as we look in our text in Hebrews 11,

00:22:53.499 --> 00:22:55.499
they were seeking a better country.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.859
That isn't heavenly.

00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:00.799
And the truth of having that eternal perspective,

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.319
the Apostle Paul as he walked upon this earth

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:05.339
and as he served the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:07.139
he declares to the church in Corinth

00:23:07.139 --> 00:23:09.339
in 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 16,

00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:11.419
for which cause we faint not,

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:13.499
but though our outward man perish,

00:23:13.499 --> 00:23:16.899
yet the inward man is renewed day by day

00:23:16.899 --> 00:23:19.299
for our light affliction,

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:21.039
which is but for a moment,

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:23.899
worketh for us a far more exceeding

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:26.439
and eternal weight of glory.

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:27.559
Why?

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:30.839
While we look not at the things which are seen,

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:33.079
but at the things which are not seen.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:36.279
For the things which are seen are temporal,

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:40.119
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:44.439
I sat in a man's house a few years ago now,

00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:45.839
just a few miles from here,

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:47.319
and I sat in his house.

00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:49.559
His son actually came to our vacation Bible school

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:51.159
several years ago.

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:52.519
We're doing follow-up visits

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:53.879
and Joseph was with me,

00:23:53.879 --> 00:23:55.799
and as we're doing these follow-up visits,

00:23:55.799 --> 00:23:57.199
I sat in this man's living room.

00:23:57.199 --> 00:23:59.519
He invited us in and we had a nice conversation.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:01.319
We began to talk about spiritual matters.

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:04.759
And he acknowledged that he was not saved.

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.399
That he was not sure of heaven.

00:24:06.399 --> 00:24:07.839
He acknowledged that.

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:09.479
Began to share the Gospel with him.

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:11.679
Began to go through some truth.

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.879
And he just was kind of resistant.

00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:15.519
I shouldn't say kind of. He was.

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:17.319
He was resistant to the truth

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:19.319
of the Word of God.

00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:20.999
And he began to share some things.

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:22.719
And I asked him this question.

00:24:22.719 --> 00:24:25.319
I said, sir, can I ask you this?

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:28.079
500 years from now,

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:30.439
what's going to matter?

00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:31.679
You know, that man stopped

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:35.479
kind of dead in his thought process.

00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:38.119
And he looked at me with all sincerity

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:41.719
and said, none of this is going to matter.

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:42.759
I said, sir, you know what?

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:44.279
You're absolutely correct.

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:45.519
None of it's going to matter.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:47.159
In fact, unless you are some type

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:48.759
of a famous individual

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:50.999
and you do something of significance,

00:24:50.999 --> 00:24:52.119
500 years from now,

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:53.719
people aren't even going to know who you are.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.719
Some people think that the Lord's going to

00:24:55.719 --> 00:24:57.159
not come back for 500 years.

00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:00.199
But if he didn't come back for 500 years,

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:01.799
the reality is that most of us

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:03.119
aren't even going to find our names

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:05.679
on some kind of history book somewhere.

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:07.399
No one's going to know about us.

00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:09.159
In fact, I don't even know

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:10.679
my great, great, great, great, great

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:13.119
whoever 500 years ago.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.159
And most of you probably don't either

00:25:15.159 --> 00:25:17.559
unless you're into the genealogy stuff.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.479
But the reality this morning is that

00:25:19.479 --> 00:25:22.399
we have to have our perspective impact it.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:24.559
And how is our perspective impacted?

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:26.879
It's when we embrace the promises of God.

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:28.999
And as we live by faith,

00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:30.999
we're going to embrace those promises.

00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:31.839
Why?

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:32.959
Because we understand that God

00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:34.879
is the one that's made the promises.

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:36.599
And that's faith.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.919
Taking God at His word.

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:41.399
Believing what God has said.

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:44.119
In just another chapter in 2 Corinthians 5

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:44.999
in verse number 20,

00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:49.399
Paul will say that we are ambassadors for Christ.

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:50.759
You understand that that carries

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:52.519
that same kind of thought

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:53.359
that we're looking at here

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:54.719
in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.319
That this world is not my home.

00:25:56.319 --> 00:25:57.319
I'm an ambassador.

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.719
I'm a representative.

00:25:58.719 --> 00:26:00.599
I understand this morning

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:03.279
that my citizenship is in heaven.

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.199
I'm thankful to be a U.S. citizen.

00:26:05.199 --> 00:26:07.399
But my citizenship is in heaven.

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.919
We see that in Ephesians chapter number three,

00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:12.039
excuse me, Philippians chapter number three

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:13.879
in verse number 20.

00:26:13.879 --> 00:26:15.399
Paul is speaking.

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:17.719
And even before we get to verse number 20

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:18.919
in chapter number three,

00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:21.039
we find that Paul tells them,

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.359
the believers in Philippi,

00:26:22.359 --> 00:26:24.399
about the importance of living

00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:26.879
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.

00:26:26.879 --> 00:26:30.279
They're to live as lights that shine in this world.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:32.599
And he comes to the end of chapter number three

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:33.959
and he says in verse number 20,

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:37.719
for our conversation is in heaven.

00:26:37.719 --> 00:26:40.319
And that word conversation is synonymous

00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:42.679
with that truth of citizenship.

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:43.959
My citizenship is in heaven.

00:26:43.959 --> 00:26:45.079
If you're saved this morning,

00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:47.279
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.519
as your personal Savior,

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:51.359
then heaven is your home.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:53.559
And sometimes we don't live like that.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:55.159
Sometimes we live like this earth

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:58.559
is all that there is.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.679
We find that he says,

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:01.319
for our conversation is in heaven

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:03.999
from whence also we look for the Savior,

00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:06.199
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:06.199 --> 00:27:09.399
I hope that you're looking for Jesus to return.

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:12.039
Paul says to Titus in Titus 2,

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:14.199
he says that we're looking for the blessed hope

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.439
and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,

00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:17.879
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:20.439
and we have that upward look of expectation

00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:22.399
that Jesus is going to return.

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:24.319
Why? Because he promised to do so.

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.279
You notice at the end back in the book of Hebrews

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:27.719
in chapter 11,

00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:30.159
the end of verse number 16 where it says this,

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:34.839
for he hath prepared for them a city.

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:36.999
Remember the truth of John chapter number 14.

00:27:36.999 --> 00:27:38.359
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:40.399
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:41.999
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:43.359
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:46.919
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:48.879
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:27:48.879 --> 00:27:50.999
I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:52.519
that where I am, Jesus said,

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:55.319
there ye may be also speaking to his disciples.

00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:57.999
And we understand by extension to us

00:27:57.999 --> 00:28:00.639
as the people of God.

00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:04.799
This morning, we noticed that Abraham,

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:07.159
his perspective changed

00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:10.119
as he embraced the promises of God.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.679
I think about this man Abraham.

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.399
Of course, we don't know much about him

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:14.799
when he was in the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:16.759
We know some things about the culture

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:19.279
and the way in which they worshiped

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.079
and were engaged in idol worship.

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:24.359
And I think about the path

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:27.159
in which Abraham journeyed and he traveled.

00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:30.679
And as he daily followed and submitted

00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:32.479
to the direction of God in his life,

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:35.319
and as he embraced the promises of God,

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:37.439
how he was able to see God work.

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:41.079
And his perspective was changed.

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:43.599
This morning, I hope that our perspective

00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.799
is changed by the promises contained

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:46.999
within the Word of God.

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:50.079
That as we look at this Word,

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:52.639
as we read and study the Word of God,

00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:55.879
that it impacts and influences us.

00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:57.879
Someone says, why do you have the perspective

00:28:57.879 --> 00:28:58.719
that you do?

00:28:58.719 --> 00:28:59.559
Why do you?

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:00.399
I hope that we can say,

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:03.319
well, it's based upon the truth of God's Word.

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:05.519
Because here's what God said in His Word.

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:07.159
Because here's what my understanding is

00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:08.679
of the promises of God.

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:10.719
And this has shaped and influenced

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:13.199
my perspective in life.

00:29:13.199 --> 00:29:14.679
Notice as we continue to go through

00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:17.199
the passage of Scripture,

00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:18.679
living by faith,

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:20.559
believes the impossible.

00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:25.159
This morning, as we begin to think

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.319
about this truth of faith,

00:29:28.439 --> 00:29:30.519
we think about what God is able to do,

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.439
we often make the reference

00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:34.239
that our God is able to do anything.

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.719
And I wonder sometimes if it's hard

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:38.799
for us to really comprehend that.

00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:43.719
If it really can be expressed in terms

00:29:43.719 --> 00:29:46.519
that we could relate to.

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:48.799
And I find that sometimes in life,

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.159
I was listening to an individual,

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:52.399
by the way, speaking just last week.

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:54.159
No one from our congregation

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.839
has listened to this individual speaking.

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.319
And in their speech,

00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:59.639
as they were seeking to be a religious

00:29:59.639 --> 00:30:00.479
quote unquote,

00:30:00.479 --> 00:30:06.919
leader and speak about faith, they were expressing their own doubt about what God is able to

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:07.919
do.

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:09.139
It was mind-boggling.

00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:13.439
It was like, scratch your head, like, what is he talking about?

00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:17.279
He's saying he believes God, but then he's saying over here, well, no, actually God can't

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.719
do that, and you have to kind of step in and do this.

00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:22.239
Like, we have to help God.

00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:24.199
Are God's able to do all things?

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:30.959
Yes, he uses his people, and I'm thankful that he uses us, but the reality is that faith,

00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:34.239
as we live by faith, we believe the impossible.

00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:40.119
Notice as the text would now turn to Genesis chapter number 22, we find that we began in

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:42.999
Genesis chapter number 11 and 12 with the call of Abram.

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:48.199
We go and fast forward to Genesis chapter number 21 with the birth of Isaac, and now

00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:53.479
if we were to look at what the writer of Hebrews is referring to in verses 17 through 19, we

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:58.679
would find that this is the record that is provided for us in Genesis 22.

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:04.599
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 17, by faith, Abraham.

00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:10.679
Now you notice that it's once again based upon the faith of Abraham, the fact that he

00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:13.159
believed God, he exercised faith.

00:31:13.159 --> 00:31:25.019
It says this, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:28.199
offered up his only begotten son.

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:37.439
Look at verse 18, of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called, a reference

00:31:37.439 --> 00:31:41.039
back to the promise of God in Genesis chapter 21.

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:46.159
And I think about what God is recording for us here in Hebrews 11, verses 17 and 18, we'll

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:50.959
look at verse 19 again in just a moment, but I want you to understand that Abraham received

00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:56.059
direction from the Lord, and he responded in obedience.

00:31:56.059 --> 00:32:00.959
We find that as Abraham received, as you look back in Genesis chapter number 22, and as

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:07.119
God expressly spoke to Abraham in this passage of Scripture, it says in verse number 1 of

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:12.559
Genesis 22, and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham, or prove

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:17.959
him, or test him, and said unto him, Abraham, and he said, behold, here I am.

00:32:17.959 --> 00:32:23.559
And God says, take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:29.079
into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains,

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:31.559
which I will tell thee of.

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:34.199
That's the instruction, the direction.

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:39.319
And in verse number 3, the Bible says that Abraham rose up early in the morning, he saddled

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:44.079
his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and claimed the wood

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:52.079
for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went into the place of which God had told him.

00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:57.899
I said this for our point of this portion of Hebrews 11, that living by faith believes

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:00.399
the impossible.

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:04.319
You know that when you begin to see God work, when you live by faith, when you're on that

00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:09.799
faith journey, and as you're walking with God and you see God work, it increases your

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:11.079
faith.

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:16.879
You know, it was, humanly speaking, impossible for Abraham and Sarah to have a son.

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:20.879
Yet, God did what He said He was going to do.

00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:25.359
And God had given him a promise, you notice in verse number 18, of whom it was said that

00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:28.679
in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:36.479
We find that it is important that we resist the temptation in our lives to lean on our

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:39.639
own understanding.

00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:45.999
That we resist in our lives the worldly counsel, the temporal counsel that some might try to

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:51.159
offer us, and that we would have our eyes upon our Lord and that we would live by faith.

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:56.479
And when I mention here that living by faith believes the impossible, I want you to see

00:33:56.719 --> 00:33:59.839
what the Bible tells us in verse number 19.

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:05.839
See, by faith Abraham, he went and he offered up Isaac, and we find that in verse number

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:10.959
19, notice what it says, accounting that God was able.

00:34:10.959 --> 00:34:14.079
Now just pause there just for a moment, I know it's not a period, a comma, nothing,

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.879
but just pause there for a moment.

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:20.199
Do you believe that God is able?

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:24.839
Accounting that God was able.

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:29.759
Now we understand that as we look through the portions of Scripture that we've studied

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:35.359
and we begin to think about the Word of God as a whole, and we find that we believe that

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:41.959
God is able, is able to do the impossible.

00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:54.159
And here the Bible says, accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:59.159
And whence also he received him in a figure.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:05.159
Let me ask you, has Abraham ever seen anyone raised from the dead?

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:07.799
Not that we're aware of.

00:35:07.799 --> 00:35:13.159
Not that's recorded in the Word of God.

00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:16.439
We find that during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, there were a few people

00:35:16.439 --> 00:35:18.359
that were raised from the dead.

00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:21.599
We find that during the ministry of Elijah and Elisha, there were some folks raised from

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:22.599
the dead.

00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:27.639
But you understand that for Abraham, there's not been one raised from the dead.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:31.279
He doesn't have anything to look back to and say, well God, you did it then, and so you

00:35:31.279 --> 00:35:32.279
could do it again.

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:35.319
No, no, he just believed God.

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:41.539
He said, God gave me this promise about my son, and now God who gave me that son is telling

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:45.799
me to offer him up, and so I just believe that if I do what God told me to do, that

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.279
God's able to raise him again.

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.719
You say, man, that's faith.

00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:50.719
Yes.

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:52.079
And I want you to think about Abraham.

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:55.279
I know that it's not contained here in the passage of Scripture, but if you were with

00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:59.839
us on Sunday evening a few weeks ago as we studied the twelfth chapter of the book of

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:04.519
Genesis, I want to remind you of what happened in the twelfth chapter of Genesis.

00:36:04.519 --> 00:36:10.959
By the way, it will happen again in our study of the life of Abraham and his life when he

00:36:10.959 --> 00:36:15.319
tells Sarah, tell him you're my sister.

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:19.799
And I want you to think about Abraham in Genesis chapter number 12 versus Abraham in Genesis

00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:21.199
chapter number 22.

00:36:21.319 --> 00:36:26.959
In Genesis chapter number 12, Abraham is just arriving to Canaan.

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:32.719
He's just arrived to that place where God had led him to, and we find that Abraham is

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:35.999
now faced with this terrible situation.

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:37.879
There's a famine in the land.

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:43.079
The Bible tells us that it's a grievous famine, and he goes to Egypt, and no doubt he knew

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:44.079
some things.

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.999
He's aware of some things because he had this understanding that Sarah, you're beautiful.

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:51.159
You're my wife, and you're beautiful, and we're going to go there, and they're going

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:54.839
to take you, and they're going to kill me because you're so beautiful.

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:56.119
And so here's what I want you to do.

00:36:56.119 --> 00:37:01.919
Tell them that you're my sister, and here's what I want you to think about.

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:05.479
As we looked at that passage of Scripture as we studied a few weeks ago, we said this

00:37:05.479 --> 00:37:11.039
in Genesis chapter number 12, that God worked miraculously.

00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:14.079
God demonstrated his power.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:22.039
God plagued Pharaoh in his house because Sarai, at the time, she was taken, and God

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:27.599
prevented them from doing anything to her.

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:28.959
And what does Pharaoh do?

00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:31.839
He calls Abraham and he says, why'd you do this?

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:35.519
Take your wife and go, and he commands all the other people to leave him alone.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.199
God worked.

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:42.519
And so I would submit to you that in Genesis chapter number 12, Abraham didn't have the

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:46.839
same level of faith that he had in Genesis chapter 22.

00:37:46.839 --> 00:37:51.159
In Genesis chapter number 22, there was some growth in Abraham's life.

00:37:51.159 --> 00:37:52.519
There were some experiences.

00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:53.519
There were some promises.

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:55.999
There were some demonstrations of God's power.

00:37:55.999 --> 00:38:00.399
No doubt, even that event that is mentioned in Genesis chapter number 12, that would develop

00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:05.519
the faith of Abraham so that when God said, get up into Moriah and offer your son, he

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:10.999
says, all right, then I know that you could raise him up because you're God.

00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:13.279
That's the kind of faith we need to have.

00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:17.519
Can I tell you, you might not have that level of faith this morning, but God will work in

00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:23.319
your life to develop that faith so that you believe the impossible.

00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:25.319
I think about Gideon.

00:38:25.319 --> 00:38:29.799
Gideon didn't believe when the Spirit of God, when the angel appeared to Gideon and said,

00:38:29.799 --> 00:38:31.839
oh, thou great man of valor, right?

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:35.279
He's like, who are you talking to?

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.279
I mean, I'm the least of my father's house, right?

00:38:37.279 --> 00:38:39.279
Isn't that what Gideon says?

00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:40.479
What does God do?

00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:43.440
He gives him some faith builders.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.760
He goes through the process of let it be wet over here and dry over here.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.239
Now let it be dry over there and wet over here, and he goes through this whole thing.

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:52.799
And then he's still not ready.

00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:57.959
And so God says to Gideon, go listen to this conversation over here.

00:38:57.959 --> 00:39:02.320
And there's a lot of passages there in Judges that record this, so I'm going real fast.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.359
But you understand that God then says, go over and listen to this conversation.

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:09.599
And he listens to the conversation and the man says, this is none other than the sword

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:10.599
of the Lord and of Gideon.

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:16.440
And Gideon, all of a sudden, he has enough faith to go and do what God told him to do.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.159
God was building his faith.

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:19.799
And God wants to build your faith.

00:39:19.799 --> 00:39:21.559
God wants to build my faith.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.760
He wants us to come to the place where we believe him.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.359
I think about the passage that I preached on Sunday evening, excuse me, on Wednesday

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:35.199
evening, this past Wednesday, dealing with the man that brought his son to the disciples.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.159
And the disciples could not cast out that demon.

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:41.959
And Jesus, of course, has that interaction with that man.

00:39:41.959 --> 00:39:48.479
And he says, Jesus says, if thou canst believe, all things are possible.

00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:51.519
Wow, what a great truth.

00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:52.919
What does the man say?

00:39:52.919 --> 00:39:57.959
I believe, help thou mine unbelief.

00:39:57.959 --> 00:40:00.119
This morning we might be in that situation.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:03.579
Lord, I believe, but I want You to help me to believe more.

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:05.699
I want You to increase my faith.

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:08.279
Help me to believe the impossible,

00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:11.399
that God, You are able."

00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:13.439
See, that's what we see here.

00:40:13.439 --> 00:40:15.979
As Abraham lived by faith,

00:40:15.979 --> 00:40:17.899
he believed the impossible.

00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:22.079
He accounted that God was able to raise him up,

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.839
even from the dead,

00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:28.039
from whence also He received him in a figure.

00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:30.799
We understand as we look at all of the Scripture

00:40:30.799 --> 00:40:35.479
and consider the picture of Abraham and Isaac,

00:40:35.479 --> 00:40:38.019
and even as Isaac and Abraham were walking up the mountain,

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.479
and Isaac says, hey, where's the offering?

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.639
And he says, God will provide.

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:44.939
And God did provide.

00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:46.199
And what a blessing that is,

00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:47.899
and what a great picture of the fact

00:40:47.899 --> 00:40:49.639
that God would send forth His Son,

00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:51.679
the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.959
to become the Lamb of God

00:40:53.959 --> 00:40:55.759
that would take away the sin of the world.

00:40:55.759 --> 00:40:57.679
That He would go to the cross of Calvary.

00:40:57.719 --> 00:40:59.919
That He would suffer, bleed, and die.

00:40:59.919 --> 00:41:01.719
That He would be buried in a borrowed tomb

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:05.559
and rise conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:08.199
What a great picture.

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.839
This morning, we find that Abraham,

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:11.559
as he walked with the Lord,

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:14.959
that it began with a submission,

00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:18.319
a daily submission to the direction of God,

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:20.279
that we just obey God.

00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:21.839
We find that it then continues

00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:24.679
with embracing the promises of God.

00:41:24.679 --> 00:41:25.999
I'm going to believe that God's going to do

00:41:25.999 --> 00:41:27.239
what He says He's going to do.

00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:28.799
And as I embrace those promises,

00:41:28.799 --> 00:41:30.279
it impacts my perspective.

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:31.999
It changes my perspective.

00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:35.279
It gives me that eternal perspective.

00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:38.799
Living by faith believes the impossible.

00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:40.119
In closing this morning,

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:42.119
as we look at the next few verses

00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:45.199
in verses 20-22,

00:41:45.199 --> 00:41:47.439
I find this, number 4 in your notes,

00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:52.919
living by faith influences future generations.

00:41:52.919 --> 00:41:56.279
Living by faith influences future generations.

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:58.319
We find that there's a generational influence

00:41:58.319 --> 00:42:00.799
that is recorded in these three verses of Scripture.

00:42:00.799 --> 00:42:01.879
And I wonder this morning,

00:42:01.879 --> 00:42:03.679
as we begin to think about

00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:05.199
the way in which we would influence

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:07.079
those that would come behind us,

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:08.399
I wonder this morning,

00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:11.440
what is it that we're giving the next generation?

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.879
I understand that there are many times

00:42:12.879 --> 00:42:14.879
in which there's discussion that takes place

00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:17.799
as to how we're going to lay up something

00:42:17.799 --> 00:42:19.119
for a future generation,

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.759
some possession, some monetary whatever it might be,

00:42:22.759 --> 00:42:25.440
but the reality is that one of the greatest things

00:42:25.479 --> 00:42:28.720
that I can give to my children is a godly heritage.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.279
One of the greatest things that I can give to my children

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:32.839
and seek to pass on to them

00:42:32.839 --> 00:42:35.279
is the faith that was once delivered to me.

00:42:35.279 --> 00:42:37.479
That I would teach them through my own life

00:42:37.479 --> 00:42:39.360
how to live by faith.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.639
To believe God.

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:43.199
And I submit to you this morning

00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:45.279
that there is a generation

00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:50.279
that desperately needs to see us live by faith.

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:53.639
They need to know that our God is real.

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:54.839
Amen?

00:42:54.879 --> 00:42:56.959
And I wonder this morning,

00:42:56.959 --> 00:42:59.799
how many of the next generation,

00:42:59.799 --> 00:43:03.239
by our own testimony, by our own example,

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:05.919
believe that God is real?

00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:09.039
Believe that our God is able to do the impossible?

00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:10.679
Have we demonstrated that to them?

00:43:10.679 --> 00:43:12.639
Have they seen us live by faith?

00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:14.720
Have they watched us walk with God

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.159
and trust God and believe God?

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.799
They need to know that our God is real.

00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:23.919
This isn't just the religion of my father.

00:43:23.919 --> 00:43:25.239
Amen?

00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:28.000
This relationship with the God of the universe

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.639
who is able.

00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:30.959
And we find this morning,

00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:33.279
listen, why is it that there's a generation

00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:34.119
that's falling away?

00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:35.519
Why is it that there's a generation

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:37.479
that's leaving the church?

00:43:37.479 --> 00:43:38.959
Why is it that there's a generation

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:41.839
that's not following with the Lord

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:42.959
and walking with the Lord?

00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:45.759
Where has it broken down?

00:43:46.959 --> 00:43:49.119
And I find here this morning

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:50.519
that as we live by faith,

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:52.080
that we have the opportunity

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:54.440
to influence a future generation.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.599
Notice with me in verse number 20,

00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:59.360
the Bible says, by faith, Isaac.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.759
We know that Isaac is the son of Abraham.

00:44:02.759 --> 00:44:07.759
And it says here that Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.

00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:12.000
Notice what it says concerning things to come.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.720
Now, you'll be mindful of the passage of Scripture

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720
that is referenced here.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.000
It's Genesis chapter number 27.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.959
And as you would have some Bible understanding

00:44:20.959 --> 00:44:22.160
and knowledge, you'd understand

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.320
that Isaac gave some instruction

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.919
and he sought to bless who?

00:44:26.919 --> 00:44:28.839
Esau, right?

00:44:28.839 --> 00:44:30.519
That's who Isaac wanted to bless, Esau.

00:44:30.519 --> 00:44:32.600
He told Esau to go and prepare this meal.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.720
And we find that the Bible would record for us

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.040
how that Jacob then enters into his presence.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.679
And Isaac is like, how did you come so quickly?

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.040
And so on and so forth.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.399
And again, I'm just quickly summarizing the passage.

00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:47.119
Go back and read all of Genesis 27

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.679
and you can see what took place.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.720
But you find that Isaac had some doubt, did he not?

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.479
Come close to me.

00:44:56.479 --> 00:44:59.639
He felt him and he said he's hairy.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.000
And we look at the passage and we begin to think,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
and some have questioned the validity

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.679
of verse number 20 in Hebrews chapter number 11

00:45:09.679 --> 00:45:11.760
and have said, no, he didn't do it by faith

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.959
because he thought he was blessing Esau, not Jacob.

00:45:13.959 --> 00:45:15.519
I beg to differ.

00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:18.839
Because I believe that the faith

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:20.760
that God is speaking of here

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.959
with regard to the faith that Isaac was exercising

00:45:24.959 --> 00:45:29.720
was faith not in who he was blessing, but in the blessing.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.199
Notice what it says, concerning things to come.

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:39.119
His faith was in the promise that God had given.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.079
Remember back in verse number nine,

00:45:41.079 --> 00:45:44.260
it says that Abraham, he was in a strange country

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.739
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob,

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:51.059
the heirs with him of the same promise.

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:54.299
And we find that as Isaac would bless Jacob,

00:45:54.299 --> 00:45:56.100
and yes, there was a blessing for Esau.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.859
Remember right after Jacob left, Esau comes in

00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:00.660
and he's like, all right, here you go, I'm ready.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.739
And it didn't work out so well.

00:46:03.739 --> 00:46:05.859
Esau was pretty upset, was he not?

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:08.459
Determined that he was gonna kill his brother, by the way.

00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:11.299
And there's a great reunion, by the way,

00:46:11.299 --> 00:46:13.859
in the word of God between Jacob and Esau.

00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.779
What a precious, precious passage of scripture it is.

00:46:16.779 --> 00:46:18.540
I believe it's Genesis 33.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.619
And you look here at the passage and you find here

00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:25.979
that he, Isaac, had faith regarding those things,

00:46:25.979 --> 00:46:29.320
concerning things to come.

00:46:30.699 --> 00:46:35.139
Again, that perspective that we found in verse number 13,

00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:36.899
not having received the promises,

00:46:36.899 --> 00:46:40.019
but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:42.859
and embraced them.

00:46:42.859 --> 00:46:45.820
Verse 21, so really as we look at verse 20,

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.339
the blessing of Isaac,

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:50.699
we'd look at that as being an individual aspect.

00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:55.339
Look at verse 21, by faith, Jacob, when he was a dying,

00:46:55.339 --> 00:46:57.859
blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship

00:46:57.859 --> 00:47:01.019
leaning upon the top of his staff.

00:47:01.019 --> 00:47:03.779
This portion of scripture really is looking at that

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:06.079
which is recorded in Genesis chapter 48,

00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:07.779
verses 11 through 22.

00:47:07.779 --> 00:47:10.100
And then we understand that all of his sons

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:13.059
would then receive a blessing and a direction

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.779
in Genesis chapter number 49 before his death.

00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:18.660
Now, it's interesting that Jacob being mentioned here,

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:20.100
it says when he was a dying,

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.220
he blessed both the sons of Joseph.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:27.019
Now remember, he thought Joseph was dead, right?

00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:29.139
The brothers, they hated Joseph,

00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:30.260
they were gonna kill Joseph,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.100
but then they figured that they could sell him

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.660
and he went into Egypt and he was there.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.699
And of course, we understand there were a number of things

00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:40.339
that God was working and how God was working.

00:47:40.339 --> 00:47:41.380
There was a great famine.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.540
Remember, there was a dream, Pharaoh had a dream.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.979
And of course, Joseph interprets that dream

00:47:45.979 --> 00:47:50.100
and that famine not only impacted Egypt,

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.019
but it also impacted Canaan.

00:47:52.019 --> 00:47:54.820
They had no food, so they sent.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.820
And Joseph is there as second command of all of Egypt.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.199
And we find on the second visit

00:48:00.199 --> 00:48:03.919
that he revealed his identity to his brothers.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.579
And you remember when they came back

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:09.940
and they told dad that Joseph was alive

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.739
and Jacob was excited.

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:17.739
I mean, he was thrilled to find out that his son was alive.

00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:21.299
And we find that before he would leave Canaan land,

00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:26.299
that he pauses there and God gives him a great promise.

00:48:27.019 --> 00:48:29.339
And it's important that we'd understand

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:33.059
that as God would appear to Jacob here

00:48:33.059 --> 00:48:38.059
in chapter number 46, sorry, yeah, chapter number 46,

00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:40.700
we find that in Genesis chapter number 46,

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.260
that God spake unto Israel in visions of the night

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.619
and said, Jacob, Jacob, and he said, here am I.

00:48:45.619 --> 00:48:48.140
In verse number three, God says this to Jacob.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.339
He says, I am God, the God of thy father.

00:48:51.339 --> 00:48:53.219
Fear not to go down into Egypt,

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:56.260
for I will there make of thee a great nation.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.419
I will go down with thee into Egypt

00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:00.979
and I will also surely bring thee up again

00:49:00.979 --> 00:49:04.700
and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.659
See, Jacob was in the land that God had promised,

00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:10.900
but he's gonna leave that land and go to Egypt.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.099
And God says to Jacob, fear not to go down into Egypt,

00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:16.940
for there in that place,

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.219
I'm going to make of thee a great nation.

00:49:19.219 --> 00:49:22.339
And he not only tells him that he's gonna go with him

00:49:22.339 --> 00:49:23.299
down into Egypt,

00:49:23.299 --> 00:49:27.580
but he says that I will surely bring thee up again.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.219
We find that as Jacob would bless the sons of Joseph

00:49:31.219 --> 00:49:32.900
in Genesis chapter 48,

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.460
we find that Jacob says to Joseph,

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.059
I had not in verse number 11 thought to see thy face

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:42.619
and lo, God hath showed me also thy seed.

00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:45.659
Can see an excited man, a rejoicing man.

00:49:45.659 --> 00:49:47.260
And he makes this blessing

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.979
and you can read the entirety of it

00:49:48.979 --> 00:49:53.419
in verses 11 through 22 of Genesis chapter 48.

00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:57.020
Again, the faith is in what God had promised

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.179
and how God had given His Word.

00:50:00.179 --> 00:50:04.139
And really, if we look at Isaac's blessing as being an individual blessing,

00:50:04.139 --> 00:50:07.679
we'd look at Jacob's blessing as being a tribal blessing.

00:50:07.679 --> 00:50:11.059
He's thinking about all of the nation of Israel, if you will,

00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:13.099
and the individual tribes that are mentioned.

00:50:13.099 --> 00:50:17.799
And then we come to the last verse of our passage for this morning,

00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:20.559
Hebrews 11 and verse number 22.

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:24.059
Hebrews 11 and verse number 22.

00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:27.299
The Bible now speaks of the faith of Joseph.

00:50:27.299 --> 00:50:29.599
I want you to think about the generational influence

00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:32.219
that we're speaking about here, as we live by faith,

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:36.059
we have the opportunity to influence future generations.

00:50:36.059 --> 00:50:38.019
Abraham lived by faith.

00:50:38.019 --> 00:50:42.479
And the Bible says, by faith, Isaac, his son, by faith, Jacob, his grandson,

00:50:42.479 --> 00:50:45.479
by faith, Joseph, his great-great-grandson.

00:50:45.479 --> 00:50:50.319
Notice what it says, when he died, the end of Genesis chapter number 50,

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:53.739
made mention of the departing of the children of Israel

00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:58.819
and gave commandment concerning his bones.

00:50:58.819 --> 00:51:03.239
He made mention, it says, of the departing of the children of Israel.

00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:04.999
We understand, as we read the book of Exodus,

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:07.619
that there rose up another pharaoh that did not know Joseph.

00:51:07.619 --> 00:51:10.579
And there was a period of heartache for the nation of Israel

00:51:10.579 --> 00:51:12.699
and difficulty in slavery,

00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:16.039
and they had all sorts of difficulties that they endured.

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:19.239
But God said, I've heard your cry, I've seen your affliction,

00:51:19.239 --> 00:51:23.159
and he sent Moses, and Moses would be the human person

00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.239
that God would use to provide deliverance for the nation of Israel.

00:51:27.239 --> 00:51:30.999
And as we look at Joseph here and we look at the faith and what he is saying,

00:51:30.999 --> 00:51:36.739
again, he's looking to the future, he's believing, embracing the promises of God.

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:41.779
God's going to let the nation of Israel depart from this land.

00:51:41.779 --> 00:51:43.619
He believed what God had said.

00:51:43.619 --> 00:51:46.779
And then he made mention, commandment concerning his bones.

00:51:46.779 --> 00:51:50.619
It's interesting, if you'd go in Genesis chapter number 50,

00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:53.619
and you see in that passage of Scripture in verses 24 and 25

00:51:53.619 --> 00:51:56.919
is what is referenced here in Hebrews 11 and verse 22,

00:51:56.919 --> 00:51:59.379
it says that Joseph said unto his brethren, I die,

00:51:59.379 --> 00:52:03.379
and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land,

00:52:03.379 --> 00:52:06.759
unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

00:52:06.759 --> 00:52:08.959
And Joseph took an oath to the children of Israel saying,

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:15.000
God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.879
Did God do what he said? Absolutely.

00:52:17.879 --> 00:52:20.459
God visited his people, God delivered his people.

00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:26.179
You know what the Bible records for us in Joshua chapter 24 and verse number 32?

00:52:26.179 --> 00:52:31.099
Years and years later, it says that the bones of Joseph,

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:34.059
which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt,

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:37.219
buried them in Shechem, a parcel of ground,

00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:41.139
which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem,

00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:42.479
for a hundred pieces of silver,

00:52:42.479 --> 00:52:46.599
and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

00:52:46.599 --> 00:52:52.299
Can I tell you this morning that living by faith pleases God?

00:52:52.299 --> 00:52:55.179
Without faith, it's impossible to please him.

00:52:55.179 --> 00:52:59.179
Begin to think about these that are mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:01.639
and we have now looked at this length,

00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:04.939
really the longest portion of Scripture in Hebrews chapter 11,

00:53:04.939 --> 00:53:09.339
devoted to Abraham, and of course, these descendants of Abraham,

00:53:09.339 --> 00:53:11.939
and thinking of the generational influence.

00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:15.939
And this morning, God wants us to live by faith.

00:53:15.939 --> 00:53:17.759
He just wants us to believe him,

00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:20.759
to believe that he will do what he said he will do.

00:53:20.799 --> 00:53:22.839
Now, we can look back,

00:53:22.839 --> 00:53:27.059
and we can see how that what they did not receive,

00:53:27.059 --> 00:53:30.099
we can see how God blessed and what God did.

00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:33.559
We have the privilege of being on this side of history

00:53:33.559 --> 00:53:35.139
and being able to look back.

00:53:35.139 --> 00:53:38.299
In our lives, though, we still need to take God at his Word,

00:53:38.299 --> 00:53:39.919
and believe God, and walk with God,

00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:42.879
and daily submit to the direction of God,

00:53:42.879 --> 00:53:46.179
and embrace the promises of God.

00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:49.839
And we believe the impossible that God is able.

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:51.759
He's able to do all things.

00:53:51.759 --> 00:53:54.259
And as we live by faith,

00:53:54.259 --> 00:53:57.719
we have the opportunity to influence a future generation.

00:53:57.719 --> 00:54:02.759
Can I tell you it's the greatest way that we could influence the next generation?

00:54:02.759 --> 00:54:04.879
To believe God.

00:54:04.879 --> 00:54:06.719
To believe God.

00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:10.219
That this next generation that's represented by the young people in our church,

00:54:10.219 --> 00:54:12.719
that they would do far greater than what we could even do.

00:54:12.719 --> 00:54:17.220
Why? Because we have instilled in them at a young age to believe God.

00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:22.299
To just in simple childlike faith, believe God.

00:54:22.299 --> 00:54:25.299
God said it, that settles it.

00:54:25.299 --> 00:54:26.799
Right?

00:54:26.799 --> 00:54:28.880
I know I've mentioned it many times.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.419
That old bumper sticker that says,

00:54:30.419 --> 00:54:32.419
God said it, I believe it, that settles it.

00:54:32.419 --> 00:54:34.880
I don't care if you believe it or not.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.519
If God said it, that settles it.

00:54:37.519 --> 00:54:39.639
It's good that you believe it,

00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:44.139
but we understand this morning that what God has said, God will do.

00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:46.919
And oh, that we would live by faith.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000
That we would have the opportunity to influence this next generation.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:58.720
Not necessarily with some possessions and some things,

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:04.299
but most importantly, with a faith that believes God.

00:55:04.299 --> 00:55:07.880
That they would learn.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.339
One thing I'd say about my parents,

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:11.799
one thing I'd say about those folks in our church.

00:55:11.799 --> 00:55:16.179
Some of you don't have children, but yet you're still influencing people.

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:19.100
You're still influencing the young people in our church.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.559
Oh, that our young people would look at you and say,

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:24.100
one thing I could say about them is they believe God.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.899
They just take God at His word.

00:55:26.899 --> 00:55:28.179
And it's a living faith.

00:55:28.179 --> 00:55:31.720
It's a visible faith.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.100
Living by faith.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.519
Let's pray.

00:55:33.519 --> 00:55:34.979
Father, we love you.

00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:38.059
We thank you so much for loving us.

00:55:38.059 --> 00:55:41.979
We thank you for the privilege of having your word

00:55:41.979 --> 00:55:45.359
in the examples of those that have gone before us.

00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:51.739
And I pray this morning that you would help us to carry the baton, so to speak.

00:55:51.739 --> 00:55:54.279
To continue to live by faith.

00:55:54.279 --> 00:56:00.899
That you might give us the opportunity to influence a future generation.

00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:03.899
Father, that you would help us to embrace the promises

00:56:03.899 --> 00:56:05.119
that you've given us in your word.

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:12.859
Understanding that as we do so, our perspective will be greatly changed.

00:56:12.859 --> 00:56:16.199
As we think of the songwriter that said as we turn our eyes upon Jesus

00:56:16.199 --> 00:56:20.440
that the things of this world grow strangely dim.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.279
All of a sudden, those things that matter most to our neighbors

00:56:24.279 --> 00:56:28.779
and maybe our co-workers, matter little to us.

00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:34.619
Because we have an eternal perspective, a heavenly perspective.

00:56:34.619 --> 00:56:37.679
Help us to live by faith.

00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:40.119
Help us to believe you.

00:56:40.119 --> 00:56:42.119
There's one that's not sure of heaven.

00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:46.699
I pray this morning that they would understand their need for Christ.

00:56:46.699 --> 00:56:53.500
That there is a heaven, there is a lake of fire, there is an eternity.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:58.839
There's only one Savior, that's the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

00:56:58.839 --> 00:57:02.660
And if they've never placed their faith and trust in the finished work of Calvary

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.079
and accepted the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:10.419
I pray that today, they would be saved.

00:57:10.419 --> 00:57:14.059
Lord, for each of us that have confessed the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:57:14.059 --> 00:57:16.720
that we know you as our Lord and Savior,

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.479
oh God, would you help us to live by faith.

00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:21.859
Increase our faith.

00:57:21.859 --> 00:57:24.899
As you did in the lives of those that have gone before us.

00:57:24.899 --> 00:57:26.699
Help us to believe you.

00:57:26.699 --> 00:57:29.299
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:57:29.299 --> 00:57:32.079
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:33.739
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:35.899
As she does, the altar's open.

00:57:35.899 --> 00:57:38.639
Feel free to make your pew an altar.

00:57:38.639 --> 00:57:41.440
But let God have his way in your life.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.639
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
