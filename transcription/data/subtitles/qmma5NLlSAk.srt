1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The book of Psalms, if you will, this morning, Psalm 34.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,300
We'll be looking at the 34th Psalm, and we'll be looking at several verses within the psalm.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,579
Not the entirety of the psalm, but we will kind of bounce through the portion of Scripture

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,920
this morning.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,579
And I have often said over the years that what we believe to be true will impact how

6
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,659
we behave.

7
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:26,420
What you believe will impact how you behave.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,000
I believe that snakes, especially poisonous snakes, are dangerous.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,979
So therefore, I stay away from them.

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:41,779
I don't need to find out by experience that their bite is going to hurt and possibly kill

11
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:42,779
me.

12
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,259
And we believe certain things.

13
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,259
I believe in gravity.

14
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,700
How many of you believe in gravity?

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,779
And there are reasons when you are off of the ground.

16
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:54,779
Why?

17
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:58,180
Because you believe in gravity, so it impacts your behavior.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,819
And we understand that to be true in life experiences, but we find this morning that

19
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:07,239
what we believe to be true about God will impact how we behave.

20
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,779
I've often said this as well.

21
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:16,980
It's equally true that how we behave reveals what we really believe.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,459
How you behave reveals what you believe.

23
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,819
In fact, there are times in life that we could say to someone, don't tell me what you

24
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,819
believe.

25
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,500
I'll just observe for a little while, and I'll be able to pretty much conclude what

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
you believe.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Why?

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,180
Because our behavior will reveal what we believe.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,260
Throughout this year, 2023, we have examined the character and nature of our God, and we

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,160
wholeheartedly agree with the psalmist when he proclaims that great is the Lord.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,379
We serve a great God.

32
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,779
He is the God that created all things.

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,220
He's the God that sustains all things.

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,540
He is my Redeemer, my Savior.

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
He's my friend.

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,540
He cares about me.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,779
He loves me.

38
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,339
He is a great God.

39
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,459
He has all power.

40
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,940
He has all wisdom.

41
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
He's everywhere present.

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,080
And we've had the opportunity through 2023 to really consider and discover how great

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,600
our God is.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,960
And I wholeheartedly agree with the psalmist when he says, I know that the Lord is great.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,559
And I hope this morning, after sitting through so many messages this year, maybe this is

46
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:29,360
the first time you're with us this morning, we have some folks visiting with us.

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,059
And I hope that you know, though you have not heard all of the sermons that I've preached

48
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:40,279
this year, that you too know and agree that God is great.

49
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:45,660
We consider the greatness of God and we are in, obviously as we look at the scriptures,

50
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,539
we see it throughout the pages of scripture, God's greatness being revealed to us.

51
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,080
But as we've studied and we've been able to have the opportunity to understand in a greater

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,600
detail how great our God is, I believe that that belief should impact our behavior.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:14,279
The reality is that how I live my life is greatly impacted by what I believe about God.

54
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,440
This morning, as we consider over the next several weeks, really throughout the end of

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,520
the year, we're going to consider how God's greatness should impact my behavior.

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,559
How does the truth that God is great impact how you live?

57
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,880
How does it impact how I live?

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,360
What we know to be true about God, does it impact how I live my life daily?

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,199
And how does it impact how we live our lives daily?

60
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,000
For the next couple of weeks, we're going to look at this truth and be aware of the

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,320
subject matter that is before us and understanding that God's greatness should have an impact

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,240
on how we pray, how we pray.

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,880
You know, prayer is a unique privilege for every child of God.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,039
In fact, we've been invited, an invitation has been extended to us to come boldly before

65
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,960
the throne of grace.

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,839
We find that our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

67
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:17,440
We find that there's one God and one mediator, the man Christ Jesus.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm thankful that I have direct access to the throne room of heaven, that at any time,

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,920
for any reason, I can enter into the presence of the almighty God and pray.

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,920
That is a unique privilege for every child of God.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,859
I would say that oftentimes, if we're not careful, it is a neglected privilege.

72
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:45,040
Many of us, if we'd be honest this morning, that our prayer lives are lacking.

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
For many of us, if we'd be transparent this morning, we would say the area of my Christian

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,880
life that really needs the most work is my prayer life.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,320
Prayer is work, prayer is labor.

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,239
There are, listen, Satan doesn't like it when you pray, he doesn't like it when I pray,

77
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:07,920
he attacks, but I believe this morning that when we truly understand the greatness of

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,540
our God, that it will impact how we pray.

79
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,799
I wonder this morning, I don't want you to answer me, I don't want you to even answer

80
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:22,799
me later if you really feel the need to, I'd be certainly willing to hear you, but

81
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm curious this morning, if we're to think about our prayer lives, what is it that you're

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
praying about?

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,480
What is it that I'm praying about right now today that only God can do?

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,019
That only God can do?

85
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:43,160
Sometimes our prayer lives can just be so shallow, just so temporal, of various things

86
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,519
But I wonder this morning, how are we praying?

87
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,040
What is it that you're praying about?

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,140
What is it that I'm praying about that's something that only God can do?

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,000
In other words, when God does it, it's extremely obvious and it's certain that we would only

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,079
be able to give God the honor and glory because we'd look at it and say, God did that.

91
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,079
That's beyond anything that I could do.

92
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,600
It's beyond what any of us could do collectively.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
God did it.

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,559
And I just wonder this morning, what are we praying about?

95
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:17,839
What are we, God talks about, prove me in the book of Malachi, contextually with regard

96
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,000
to giving, but he says, prove me.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Listen, we serve the almighty God and he's able to do wonderful things.

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,920
As we look at Psalm 34, there's a phrase that I've used for our title this morning, this

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,799
poor man cried.

100
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,799
This poor man cried.

101
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:38,720
As we look at the 34th Psalm this morning, I want you to see how that David's belief

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
about God impacted his prayer life.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,920
What he believed to be true about God impacted his prayer life.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,399
Notice with me in verse number one of Psalm 34, the Bible says, I will bless the Lord

105
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,399
at all times.

106
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,799
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

107
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,359
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

108
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,760
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.

109
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together.

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,320
I saw the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,200
They looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed.

112
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,160
This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,119
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them.

114
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:33,679
Notice verse eight, oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.

115
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:37,519
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

116
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,399
I hope this morning that you know that the Lord is good.

117
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,160
I hope you know that he is good no matter what the circumstances are that you're facing

118
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
in life.

119
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,359
God is good and he is a good God.

120
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,359
He's a gracious God.

121
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,839
He's a merciful God.

122
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,200
He's a great God.

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,480
And the Bible says, blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

124
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,399
God wants us to trust him, to believe him.

125
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,040
And as we look at this portion of scripture this morning, we consider this thought with

126
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:08,359
regard to what we believe about God will impact how we pray, will impact our prayer lives.

127
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:12,959
I want you to notice in the life of David in these few verses, if you're, I'm gonna

128
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,959
answer three questions this morning, obvious questions, but I hope to be a help to you.

129
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,640
Number one, if you're taking notes, to whom did David cry?

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
To whom did David cry?

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,519
Well, the Bible says in verse number one that he says, I will bless the Lord at all times.

132
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,960
And so we find that he blessed the Lord according to verse number one, he gives further explanation

133
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,760
that his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

134
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
Listen, I hope this morning that you live a life of praise.

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,280
I hope this morning that you understand that there are countless, I mean, just the number

136
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,960
of reasons that we have to praise our God.

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,400
He is worthy of our praise.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,440
And here the Psalmist says, David says his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

139
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,559
And by the way, he'd rather hear your praise than complain.

140
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,919
Amen.

141
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,400
And by the way, he hears you when you complain and when you praise.

142
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,919
And you can look at that in the scriptures and find the Bible says the people complained

143
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,599
and the Lord heard them there in the Pentateuch.

144
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:18,659
And we find here that David is saying, I'm blessing the Lord.

145
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,039
Notice in verse number two, he says that he's boasting in the Lord.

146
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,599
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

147
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,880
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.

148
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,400
I believe this is the idea of exalting and magnifying the Lord.

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,880
What a blessing to boast in the Lord.

150
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
Listen, a lot of people that want to boast about themselves.

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,880
They want to talk about how good they are and how wonderful they are and how blessed

152
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,039
we are to know them and to be in their presence and so on and so forth.

153
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,799
But I want you to understand this morning that we serve a great God and we ought to

154
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,880
be boasting in our God.

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,960
We ought to be talking about how wonderful our God is.

156
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
We ought to be exalting him.

157
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,080
The Bible says that John the Baptist said he must increase and I must decrease.

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,000
And we find that the psalmist is boasting in the Lord.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,259
Number three, he's magnifying the Lord

160
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,900
and he even extends an invitation to others.

161
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,739
He says, oh, magnify the Lord with me

162
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,819
and let us exalt his name together.

163
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,319
There's something awesome about corporate worship.

164
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,379
There's something amazing about the opportunity.

165
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,180
Listen, every day of your life,

166
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,020
you have the privilege of being able to enter

167
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,540
personally, privately into the presence of God

168
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,659
to magnify and exalt his name.

169
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,379
But when we gather together as the saints of God

170
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,100
to corporately magnify the Lord together,

171
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,500
there's something mighty sweet about that.

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,619
There's something that's a blessing about corporate worship

173
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,220
and what a blessing that we have

174
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,860
to magnify the Lord together.

175
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,599
And David's saying to those,

176
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,180
come magnify the Lord with me.

177
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,580
Let us exalt his name together.

178
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,500
Notice in verse number four, the Bible says,

179
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,540
I sought the Lord.

180
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,700
I sought the Lord.

181
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,939
Are you seeking the Lord?

182
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,740
Notice the Bible says, and he heard me.

183
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,260
We find that in verse number six,

184
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,260
it says this poor man cried and the Lord heard him.

185
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,940
So I believe that in verse number four

186
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,080
and again in verse number six,

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,019
when David says, I sought the Lord,

188
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,040
when David says this poor man cried,

189
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,300
that what he's referring to in verse number four

190
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,260
and verse number six is prayer.

191
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,180
Because in both instances, David says the Lord heard him.

192
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,180
And so he says, I sought the Lord and he heard me.

193
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,180
This poor man cried and the Lord heard him.

194
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,300
Listen, I'm so thankful for the Bible truth

195
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,260
that God hears us when we pray.

196
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm so thankful that God has given us example

197
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,339
after example.

198
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,220
I think of Solomon when he prayed to dedicate the temple.

199
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,059
And after that long prayer that's recorded,

200
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,459
that God responds to Solomon and says,

201
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,580
I have heard thy prayer.

202
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,839
I'm thankful that God tells Jeremiah,

203
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,400
call unto me and I will answer thee

204
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,559
and show thee great and mighty things,

205
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,779
which thou knowest not.

206
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,440
The Bible speaks about, I love the Lord.

207
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,279
Why?

208
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,099
Because he heard me.

209
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,300
He hears my voice.

210
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,639
He hears my prayer.

211
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,779
What a blessing.

212
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,000
And when I asked the question, to whom did he, David, cry?

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,839
He cried to the Lord.

214
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,320
He cried to the Lord.

215
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,639
He's blessing the Lord.

216
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,839
He's boasting in the Lord.

217
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,139
He's magnifying the Lord.

218
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,479
He's seeking the Lord.

219
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,919
It says in verse number six, this poor man cried.

220
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,160
It does not say this poor man cried unto the Lord,

221
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,320
but I think it's abundantly obvious in verse number six

222
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
that he was crying unto the Lord.

223
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,220
He was seeking and praying to the God of the universe.

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,600
Listen, we must never forget this morning

225
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,039
that our prayer is directed to our living savior,

226
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,759
that our prayer is directed to the Lord.

227
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,639
If you notice in your Bibles this morning,

228
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,919
if you have a King James Bible,

229
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,080
the word Lord in each of these verses is all caps.

230
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,960
That's signifying that it's Jehovah God,

231
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
the self-existent one.

232
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,720
And we begin to think about to whom David is praying,

233
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,440
and we think about and we understand this morning

234
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,960
that he's praying to the creator of the universe.

235
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,720
He's praying to the one that created everything

236
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,039
out of nothing.

237
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,720
He's praying to the one that said,

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,399
let there be light, and there was light.

239
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,160
He's praying to the one that the Bible recounts

240
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,559
as his work of creation and seeing the stars

241
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,720
that he made the stars also,

242
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,479
that he made man in his own image.

243
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,639
And you begin to think about the power

244
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,300
that's displayed through creation,

245
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,839
the wisdom that's displayed through creation,

246
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,759
and David is praying to the Lord.

247
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,300
And this morning, you too are praying to the Lord.

248
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,539
I think about this morning as we understand

249
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,740
the almighty God, El Shaddai,

250
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,619
as he introduces himself to Abram there in Genesis 17.

251
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,100
He is the almighty, the omnipotent,

252
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,699
the omniscient, the omnipresent God.

253
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,600
He is the one who rules and reigns.

254
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,539
He is the one that conquered sin, death, and the grave.

255
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,740
He is the one that lives forevermore.

256
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,179
He says in the book of Revelation,

257
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,580
I was dead, but I'm alive forevermore.

258
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,179
I think about the truth that this morning,

259
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,820
when you pray and when I pray,

260
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,059
when I spent time this morning in prayer,

261
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,459
I wasn't praying to some idol.

262
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,899
I wasn't praying to some image.

263
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,859
I wasn't praying to some dead deity.

264
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:32,299
No, I was praying to the living God who hears me,

265
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,500
who's able to do exceeding abundantly

266
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,420
above all that I ask or think.

267
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,480
And what a blessing to know

268
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
that David directed his prayer to God.

269
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
This morning, to whom did he pray?

270
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm thankful that the God of the universe,

271
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,239
the God who loves the world,

272
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,839
cares about you and me.

273
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,839
He's an individual God.

274
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,640
He knows your hurts.

275
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,519
He knows your concerns.

276
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,119
He knows your problems.

277
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,559
And he cares about you.

278
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,040
And he loves you in spite of all of that.

279
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,440
And this morning, when we think about David

280
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,119
in this text of scripture,

281
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,320
we find that he's seeking the Lord.

282
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,959
See, I believe as we continue to look

283
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,679
through this passage of scripture,

284
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,359
we could answer this question,

285
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,959
number two, if you're taking notes,

286
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,959
why did David cry unto the Lord?

287
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,480
We answer the question, to whom did David cry?

288
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,799
He cried unto the Lord.

289
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,239
But then we ask the question, why did he cry?

290
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,239
Why did David cry unto the Lord?

291
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,160
I think if we're not careful this morning

292
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,359
that our immediate answer

293
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,839
or maybe the obvious surface answer

294
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,000
would be that we would say

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,480
that David cried unto the Lord

296
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,119
because he had problems.

297
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,720
David cried unto the Lord because he had troubles.

298
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,279
But I would submit to you this morning

299
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,640
that if we were to dig deeper,

300
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,000
if we were to think deeper

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,040
and really examine what's taking place

302
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
and giving an answer to that question,

303
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,760
I believe this morning that we would say

304
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,920
that David, the reason that he cried unto the Lord

305
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,279
is because of what he understood to be true

306
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,279
about the Lord.

307
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,160
See, he sought the Lord

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,279
because he believed that the Lord heard him.

309
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
He prayed, he cried unto the Lord

310
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,920
because he believed that God could do something

311
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,679
about his situation, about his circumstances.

312
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,079
He cries unto the Lord,

313
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
not just because of his troubles,

314
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,119
not just because of his problems.

315
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,519
He directs his prayer to the Lord

316
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,959
because of what or who he understands God to be.

317
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,959
We mentioned already that on two occasions

318
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,040
in verse four and verse six,

319
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,959
the Bible says that the Lord heard him.

320
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,720
And again, what a blessing that is

321
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
and the encouragement that we receive

322
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,720
from understanding that David sought the Lord,

323
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,000
he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard him.

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,200
But as we begin to think and answer this question,

325
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,519
why did he cry unto the Lord?

326
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,040
And if we only give that surface answer

327
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,079
with regard to because he had a problem,

328
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,920
well, we understand even in our lives,

329
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,000
our daily lives, that we have problems.

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
We have issues.

331
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
And there are times that we have to call upon someone

332
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,600
to give us assistance.

333
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,239
Ms. Marjorie's dealing with a plumbing issue

334
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:16,320
and she did not call an auto mechanic

335
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,679
for a plumbing issue.

336
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,519
Why?

337
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,760
You say, Pastor, that's kind of basic.

338
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
We understand that.

339
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,200
Listen, when you have a plumbing issue, you call a plumber.

340
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,519
You have an electrical issue, you call an electrician.

341
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,359
Am I right?

342
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
Right, you have a problem.

343
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,279
You have a toothache, you got a problem,

344
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,559
you go to the foot doctor.

345
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,119
No.

346
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,519
You don't call the podiatrist

347
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,640
when you got a problem with a tooth.

348
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
Why?

349
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,720
Because they're not qualified.

350
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,559
You say, but they're a doctor, but they're not qualified.

351
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,040
That's not their area of expertise.

352
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you understand?

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,480
Listen, we deal with this every day of our lives.

354
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,480
Sometimes if we're not careful as Christians,

355
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,320
we have problems in our lives when we call somebody,

356
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,279
we try to get help from some source,

357
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,559
maybe a brother or sister in Christ, whatever it might be,

358
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,959
but we try to get help, we need this help or that help,

359
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,320
but I'm telling you this morning

360
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,720
that God is the one that we should pray to

361
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,160
because we understand who he is.

362
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,239
David, in this area of his life,

363
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,519
in this time of difficulty and all that was taking place,

364
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,359
why did he cry unto the Lord?

365
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,959
Simply because he had a trouble?

366
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,799
No.

367
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,559
Because he knew who God was.

368
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,520
And this morning, what leads you and I,

369
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,919
what leads us in the time of our crisis,

370
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,919
in the time of difficulty to pray to God

371
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,039
is that we know who God is.

372
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,880
What is it that impacts your prayer life?

373
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,039
How is it that we have a prayer life this morning

374
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,919
that we spend time in prayer?

375
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,960
Well, because of what we understand to be true about God.

376
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,960
When I understand who God is,

377
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
when I understand what he is capable of doing,

378
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
that is what leads me to a place

379
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,000
of seeking God's face through prayer.

380
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,679
See, if I really don't know the God of the Bible,

381
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,400
then why would I pray to the God of the Bible?

382
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,559
If I don't know that he could do all things,

383
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,640
why am I going to ask him to do something

384
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,280
that's beyond what I could even believe?

385
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,760
This morning, David cried unto the Lord,

386
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
not simply because of his troubles,

387
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,119
not simply because of his problems,

388
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,119
he cried unto the Lord because he knew the Lord.

389
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,799
He knew who God was.

390
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,400
He knew the character and the nature of God.

391
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,280
This morning, begin to think about my prayer life,

392
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,559
begin to think about your prayer life,

393
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,280
begin to examine your prayer life,

394
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,359
and begin to take that examination,

395
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,599
say, how is my prayer life today?

396
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,119
Do I really, does my prayer life really demonstrate?

397
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:10,199
does it really reveal that I believe that God is able? Does my prayer life really reveal

398
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:17,599
that God is omniscient, that He's omnipotent? If I examine my prayer life, what does my

399
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,799
prayer life reveal about what I believe to be true about God?

400
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,279
The third question that we'll answer this morning and spend most of our time here is

401
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:34,239
this, if you're taking notes, number three, what was the result of his cry? What was the

402
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:38,719
result of his cry? Well, we find in verse number four the Bible says, I sought the Lord

403
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:44,999
and He heard me. Then notice the rest of verse number four, and delivered me from all my

404
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:52,979
fears. We live in the midst of a people that at times will use this terminology. I remember

405
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:57,419
years ago, and I'm getting older and older, and I'm realizing that as I interact with

406
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,759
people and some of the things that I would think that happened just a few years ago

407
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,079
actually took place a whole lot longer than what I might remember. But the reality is

408
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,439
there used to be this, I don't even know if the clothing line is even around anymore,

409
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:14,419
but there was this, I remember in high school, no fear. You'd have these shirts that would

410
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,239
say no fear. And you would have this. And the reality is that though we live in the

411
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:25,439
midst of a nation and a people that sometimes try to portray that idea, I'm not afraid

412
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:38,379
of anything. We have a lot of fears. You know people fear the future. People fear the uncertainties.

413
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:44,019
People fear death. There are a lot of people that fear death. It's a natural thing to fear

414
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:49,619
death unless you've been saved by the blood of the Lamb. According to Hebrews 2, He's

415
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,739
delivered us from that fear. Why? Because I know that to be absent from the body is

416
00:21:53,739 --> 00:22:01,059
to be present with the Lord. I remember being afraid of dying before I got saved. What I'm

417
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,899
saying to you this morning is that there's a lot of people in our world that have a lot

418
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:12,720
of fears. There's a lot of fear in our society. And David, for whatever reason, and you can

419
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,000
look at various ideas as to when it was that David actually penned this psalm, and regardless

420
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,759
of the particular timing, it seems quite obvious, whether it's the exact timing, that

421
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,360
it definitely was during the time in which he was running from Saul. Remember Saul was

422
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,479
seeking to kill David. And Saul not only desired to kill David himself, but he tried to get

423
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,279
his servants to kill David. He tried to employ the mighty men that he had in his army to

424
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:44,519
kill David. And David's on the run and all these things are taking place. And David says

425
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,759
this at one point as he meets with Samuel. He says, there's but a step between me and

426
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,639
death. And you begin to think about the turmoil and the difficulties in which David was facing.

427
00:22:53,639 --> 00:23:00,000
And we find that here, the Bible says in verse number four, one of the results of David crying

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,679
unto the Lord, seeking the Lord, is that he, the Lord, delivered me from all my fears.

429
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,360
How is that possible? Listen, I can't deliver you from your fears. You can have fears and

430
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,479
you can come to me and say, pastor, I need your help. But the reality this morning is

431
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:26,559
that I am not capable of delivering you from your fears. But I know the one who can. And

432
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,239
one of the names that's ascribed to our God is that he is the Prince of Peace. He's the

433
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:38,119
Prince of Peace. We find that he gives peace. We understand that the Bible speaks about

434
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:44,399
great peace, have they which love thy law. The Bible speaks about God keeping us in his

435
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:51,360
peace as we keep our minds stayed upon him. And he is the Lord Jehovah. We find that he

436
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,759
is the Prince of Peace and he gives his children peace. We're able to have in the midst of

437
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,319
turmoil and difficulty and all of the things that are taking place in our lives and our

438
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:08,279
world today, we can have peace. God can deliver you from those things that might bring fear

439
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:15,399
in your life. Why? Because he is the giver of peace. This morning we understand and we'll

440
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:22,119
look at two aspects of this. The Bible speaks about having peace with God. And I'll say

441
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,320
this from Romans chapter 5 and verse number 1, there's only one way to have peace with

442
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,440
God and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ. There are times in your life, no doubt, there

443
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,239
are times in my life that I've heard people say something like this when I've spoken to

444
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:41,160
them about eternity and about death and they'll say something like this, I've made my peace

445
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,959
with God. Have you ever heard somebody use that phraseology? And I'll say to them, well

446
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:50,119
based upon what the Bible teaches, there's only one way to make peace with God and that's

447
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:57,040
through Jesus Christ. Often in my life I have experienced as people have used that terminology,

448
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
that is not what they meant when they said they've made their peace with God. But I'm

449
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,679
thankful to have peace with God. I'm thankful that because of the Lord Jesus Christ and

450
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,919
his substitutionary atonement on a cruel cross nearly 2,000 years ago that he offers peace

451
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,720
through his blood and we can have peace with God. Listen, we were enemies of God. We were

452
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,720
at odds with God but he reconciled us, he redeemed us and we now have peace with God

453
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,760
if we've been born again. But there's also the peace of God. The peace of God is the

454
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:38,000
different than peace with God. The peace of God is something that you experience daily

455
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,199
in your lives. As you walk in the Spirit, the Bible says the fruit of the Spirit is

456
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:49,199
love, joy, peace. That's what the Bible teaches us. The fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace.

457
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:56,479
And he gives us peace. Jesus said this in the book of John, in John chapter number 14

458
00:25:56,479 --> 00:26:00,799
and what a blessing to think about this portion of scripture and you know that as you start

459
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,199
John 14, Jesus, he'd given some instruction in chapter number 13. He gave him the new

460
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:11,119
commandment about loving one another as he loved and we find that he then, as he had

461
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,760
given him information with regard to the cross that was just on the horizon, he says, let

462
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,160
not your heart be troubled. Why would Jesus say that to the disciples? Because they had

463
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,959
troubled hearts. He says, let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also

464
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:32,559
in me. In my Father's house are many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you. I

465
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,359
go to prepare a place for you and if I go, I will come again. Aren't you thankful for

466
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:43,279
that wonderful promise? And receive you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also.

467
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,720
And he gave us that promise and he gives them that truth of not being troubled. But then

468
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,959
in verse number 27 of John 14, notice what Jesus says. Jesus says this to these disciples.

469
00:26:53,959 --> 00:27:02,880
He says, peace I leave with you. And then notice this, my peace. You know some of the

470
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:12,760
modern translations take out that word my. Listen, I'm thankful to have God's peace.

471
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,239
The world tries to offer peace. You know what the world thinks about peace? It's the absence

472
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:25,320
of trouble. The world seems to think that peace is the absence of conflict. Am I right?

473
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,519
That's the world's ideology of what peace is. If I can come to a place of being void

474
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:38,519
of trouble and problem and conflict, then and only then I will have peace. I disagree.

475
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:45,279
We can have peace in the midst of great turmoil because we can have the peace of God. And

476
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,820
here's what Jesus says, peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. Not as the

477
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,399
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Notice what it says, let

478
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:03,799
neither let it be afraid. What is it that David said? He said, I sought the Lord and

479
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:12,760
the Lord heard me and he delivered me, what, from all my fears. And here we find that Jesus,

480
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,679
he says let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Why? Because I'm giving

481
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,000
you my peace. We find that the Bible teaches us in the book of Colossians that we're to

482
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,919
let the peace of God rule in our hearts. And you think about that decision of allowing

483
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,799
God's peace to rule in our hearts, we get the idea of the word umpire from that particular

484
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,320
word in the Greek and the idea of ruling. And often, no doubt, you've watched sporting

485
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,320
events at some point in your life and when you watch those sporting events, there's some

486
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,159
people that are on the particular field or in the arena or on the court, whatever the

487
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:57,679
particular sporting event that you're watching, and there's somebody that is the authority,

488
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,799
somebody that has the rule on that particular event. Normally, they're dressed a little

489
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,479
bit differently. You see them with stripes sometimes. They're referees and I remember

490
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:13,919
playing baseball, that was my main sport, and we'd call the umpire blue because often

491
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,119
they wore blue and we'd refer to them in that fashion. And listen, it doesn't matter how

492
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,479
much you argue and how much you debate, the reality is that they are the authority. You

493
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:29,119
say, pastor, they can now challenge calls. I understand because they are not perfect,

494
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,640
but our God is perfect. And he gives us a peace that is perfect and he says that we're

495
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,380
to let God's peace rule in our hearts. You say, pastor, did you see the headlines? Did

496
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,719
you see what's going on? Did you see this? What are we going to do about that? And what

497
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:50,719
about this? Let the peace of God rule in your hearts. David said I sought the Lord and He

498
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:59,679
heard me and He delivered me from all my fears. If it's causing you to be afraid, if it's

499
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,880
causing you to be afraid, if it's causing you to be afraid, if it's causing you to

500
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,299
be afraid, if it's causing you to be afraid, then you're in trouble.

501
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:08,619
to be anxious. God offers you the peace, His peace. We need to get in time with God. We

502
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:16,019
need to pray and seek His face and know that He's able. Why did David seek the Lord? Because

503
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:22,339
he knew God. He knew who God was. He knows who He is. You and I this morning, why do

504
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:29,179
we seek God? Because we know who He is. And then we'd say because we have fears. And He's

505
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,459
the Prince of Peace and He will give us peace. Notice with me in verse number 6, the Bible

506
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:38,499
says this there in Psalm 34, in verse number 6, not only did He say in verse number 4,

507
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:42,939
I sought the Lord and He heard me and delivered me from all my fears. But notice also in verse

508
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:52,739
number 6, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.

509
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:57,619
Do you have any troubles this morning? You say, Pastor, I don't have enough time. Neither

510
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:05,459
do I. Amen. But the reality is that man that's born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

511
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:12,019
We have troubles, difficulties. Paul says it this way, there's a great and effectual

512
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:21,579
door that was opened but there are many adversaries. The work of God has always met with adversity.

513
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:27,419
Why? Because we have an enemy. Because we have an enemy. You read the book of Ezra and

514
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:35,499
Nehemiah. They're trying to do a work for God and they're met with adversity over and

515
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:41,139
over. You read the early church in the book of Acts as the history is provided to us as

516
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:45,939
they're seeking to go and give the gospel, they're met with adversity. And so we find

517
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:50,779
that David here, because of the circumstances in which he's dealing with but greater because

518
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:55,539
of he knows who God is, he cries unto the Lord and the Bible tells us again that the

519
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,779
Lord heard him but it tells us the result of David crying unto the Lord was that the

520
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:09,179
Lord saved him out of all his troubles. You know we have troubles in our lives that only

521
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:17,979
God can deliver us from. That only God can save us from. I think about the disciples

522
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:22,259
when they're there in the storm and Jesus is going to walk by. There's a couple of

523
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,699
different instances. There's one when he's in the boat asleep but there's another one

524
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:30,219
when they're in a storm and he's going to walk by. And the Bible tells us this, it's

525
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:37,739
a fascinating terminology that they were toiling and rowing. I hope your mind can get the picture

526
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:43,019
of that. If you're, I mean as much as you can possibly try to go and you're not making

527
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:50,339
any progress because the storm was so great they just couldn't get to where they were

528
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:55,979
trying to get to. They were toiling and rowing. Have you ever been there in life? I mean maybe

529
00:32:55,979 --> 00:33:04,059
not on a body of water in a vessel but in life you've been toiling and rowing. And I

530
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:10,419
believe that Jesus, I believe that he would have passed right on by if they didn't invite

531
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:16,379
him on the vessel. You know why I believe that? Because God doesn't force himself upon

532
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:27,459
you or upon me. If you want to toil and rowing, sometimes he'll let you. But I'd rather invite

533
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:34,259
him in and see what he can do. Because he can do greater than I can do. He can do greater

534
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,619
than you can do. Why does David call on the Lord in the midst of his trouble? Because

535
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:43,979
he knows that he's the Lord God Almighty. He knows what God is able to do. He's experienced.

536
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:48,299
Listen, David, he testifies when he stands before Saul long before he's ever running

537
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:55,779
from Saul. He testifies before Saul as to the greatness of God. David, you're not able

538
00:33:55,779 --> 00:34:00,899
to go fight against Goliath. I mean you're but a youth and he's a man of war from his

539
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:10,019
days. David, you can't do this. And David said, my God will deliver him into my hand.

540
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:17,459
There was a time when I was watching the flock. You understand what David testified, right?

541
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:27,859
He knew Jehovah God. And so in the midst of his troubles he prays to God because he knows

542
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:36,500
who God is. And when he prays to God he says God heard him. And he says that God delivered

543
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,419
him, saved him out of all his troubles. Listen, this morning nothing's too hard for the Lord.

544
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:47,940
You say, pastor, I've got this problem. I mean it's just a mountain. It's not too hard

545
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:57,299
for God. It's not too hard for God. There's nothing impossible with God. I'm thankful

546
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:02,139
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. I'm thankful

547
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:06,179
this morning that when he said that he's the Lord God Almighty, he then asked the question,

548
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:09,339
is anything too hard for the Lord? Listen, there are some things in your life and there

549
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:14,339
are some things in my life that are too hard for us. You might be in the midst and experience

550
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,940
something right now. You say, this is beyond me. This is beyond me. I can't do this. You're

551
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:28,139
right. But God can. He wants you to seek him. He wants you to believe him. And this

552
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,379
morning when we begin to think about the prayer life of David as outlined here in Psalm 34,

553
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:38,819
and as he says, I mean it starts with adoration and praise and rejoicing, but he's seeking

554
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:43,819
the Lord. He's crying unto the Lord and he gives us that wonderful truth that God heard

555
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:50,179
him and God delivered him. This morning, as we begin to think about this result for

556
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:55,139
David in his life and how he experienced the mighty hand of God, and again, we do not know

557
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,979
for certainty exactly the timing, but if you were to look through that portion of time

558
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:04,059
in David's life as it's recorded for us in the book of 1 Samuel, you have the opportunity

559
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:11,019
to see a number of times in which God delivered him miraculously. Where God intervened and

560
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:17,819
God did something that David could not orchestrate. See, sometimes in life we try to kind of orchestrate

561
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:23,379
some things. We try to manipulate some things. We try to help work some things together.

562
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:28,099
But the reality is it's pretty sweet to see what God can do. Because God can do what we

563
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:32,619
cannot do and there are times in life, listen, there are times that sometimes if we're not

564
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,859
careful, we try to help God out. We pray and we try to give God the solution. Have you

565
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,779
ever been guilty of that? Say, God, here's my problem and here's a good way that you

566
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:47,619
could solve it for me. Let him be God. He's God. He knows better than you do. Notice a

567
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:53,339
quick example in 1 Samuel 23 if you want to turn back there. Just one example of a miraculous

568
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,500
way in which God delivered David. Again, I don't know the exact timing of the writing

569
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,459
of Psalm 34. There's some debate out there with regard to when it actually took place,

570
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:07,579
but it seems quite obvious and there's a level of agreement that it was during the time in

571
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:13,220
which David was running from Saul. And 1 Samuel 23 is one of those instances. It begins

572
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,459
when David was in a place, the Keilah, where the Philistines went against Keilah and David

573
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:23,079
inquired of the Lord and sought the Lord with regard to going and delivering this particular

574
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,699
city from the attack of the Philistines and God tells him to do so. And after David is

575
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:35,579
there, Saul finds out that David is in that place and he has this idea that he now can

576
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,139
have an opportunity to catch and kill David because of where he was located. And David

577
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:46,819
begins to inquire of the Lord because David heard that Saul was going to come and that

578
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:53,019
was seeking to destroy him and David asked the Lord if Saul was going to come and God

579
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:57,459
said yes, Saul's going to come. And then David asked the Lord if the people, the inhabitants

580
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:01,979
of Keilah, the men that he just delivered from the Philistines, if they would deliver

581
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:07,699
him to Saul and God says yes, they will. Can you imagine that? The people that you

582
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:13,539
just rescued are going to turn you over to the one that wants to kill you. That's what's

583
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:18,659
happening in the beginning of 1 Samuel 23. David, he leaves and he's going out in the

584
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:24,659
wilderness, the wilderness of Ziph and he's there and we find that Saul makes this statement

585
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:31,039
at the end of verse 23, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

586
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,000
In verse 25 it says that his men, Saul also and his men went out to seek David, to seek

587
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,399
him. We find that they're maneuvering for position if you will. In verse 26 the Bible

588
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:46,119
says that Saul went on this side of the mountain and David and his men on that side of the

589
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:52,000
mountain and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. What did God deliver David

590
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,320
from according to verse number 4 of our text? All of his what? Fears. Verse number 6, all

591
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:04,239
of his troubles. And it says here in verse number 6 of our text of scripture in 1 Samuel

592
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:10,479
23 that David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. For Saul, notice the end of verse

593
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:15,599
26, and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. I mean he's surrounded,

594
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,599
he's in a bad situation. He's afraid. Again, I don't know with certainty that this is where

595
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,599
the prayer of Psalm 34 came from, but it certainly fits. The Bible says in verse 27, but there

596
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,359
came a messenger. There came a messenger unto Saul. You see what's happening before this

597
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:45,519
messenger comes? What's David, David's running? What's Saul's purpose? I'm going to destroy

598
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:52,519
him, I'm going to kill him. He's not going to surround him. And a messenger comes. A

599
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,760
messenger comes. And the Bible says in verse 27, the messenger came to Saul saying, notice

600
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,880
what the messenger says, haste thee and come.

601
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,600
For the Philistines have invaded the land."

602
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Who's Saul?

603
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Well, he's the king.

604
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,280
He's got a responsibility.

605
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,840
And the Philistines have invaded the land.

606
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Why?

607
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,000
Because Saul's out there hunting David, trying to kill David.

608
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,320
And the messenger comes.

609
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,040
As David and his men are surrounded, the messenger arrives.

610
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,960
And the Bible says the messenger says, haste thee.

611
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,420
I mean, there's no time to waste.

612
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,160
The Philistines have already invaded the land.

613
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,680
I would submit to you that this happened well in advance of the messenger arriving.

614
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,520
They had time to travel and what have you, and news did not spread like it does today.

615
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,120
And there had to be some time that passed.

616
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,560
And the Bible says in verse 28, wherefore, notice what the Bible says, Saul returned

617
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,600
from pursuing after David.

618
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,500
And I tell you this morning that David could not have brought that to pass.

619
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,400
Only God could do that.

620
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,840
And God worked in such a way in David's life.

621
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Why?

622
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,180
Because David prayed.

623
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
David sought the Lord.

624
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,520
David cried unto the Lord.

625
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Again, whether this timing is exactly the timing of Psalm 34 is not the point that

626
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
I'm seeking to make this morning.

627
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm simply saying to you this morning that David understood that God is able, that David

628
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,080
understood that God could work beyond what he could even imagine.

629
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:34,680
God could use a messenger because the Philistines invaded the land to have Saul return from

630
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,760
pursuing after him.

631
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,480
We serve a great God who's able to do all things.

632
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,200
How does it impact our prayer life?

633
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,680
How does it impact us?

634
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,320
Do we pray like we serve an omnipotent God?

635
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Do we pray like we serve an omniscient God?

636
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,340
How does what we believe about God impact our prayer lives?

637
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:07,960
I want to close with a wonderful truth from Psalm 34.

638
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,279
As we examine the life of David in these first several verses of Psalm 34, the amazing thing

639
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:20,600
to me and the application that I want us to walk away with this morning is that David

640
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,080
is sharing in the beginning of this portion of Scripture of Psalm 34 his personal experience.

641
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,919
He says, I sought the Lord.

642
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:33,279
He says, this poor man cried.

643
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:38,200
He's speaking about his personal experience that I sought the Lord, I cried unto the Lord

644
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,360
and God heard me and God delivered me.

645
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,200
He's giving a personal testimony.

646
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,500
He's testifying of his personal experience.

647
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,180
But I want you to take and look at verse 17 because in verse number 17, the Bible says

648
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,779
the righteous cry.

649
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:56,779
Who's the righteous?

650
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:01,100
Well, if you've been born again this morning, we sang a lot about being saved this morning.

651
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,860
If you've been born again this morning, you are righteous before God.

652
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,380
You are declared righteous.

653
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,260
In fact, it's not your righteousness, it's his righteousness that's been imputed upon

654
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
you.

655
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,340
The Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5 that he, God, hath made him Jesus

656
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:21,779
to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in

657
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:22,779
him.

658
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:26,860
What a blessing to be declared righteous.

659
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:34,980
The Bible says that the righteous cry and notice the Lord heareth them, but it doesn't

660
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:43,260
stop there, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

661
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,419
Did you see it this morning in verse 17?

662
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:49,059
I mean, listen, I'm thankful for David's personal testimony.

663
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:54,660
I'm thankful for David's personal experience that he says, I sought the Lord, that he says,

664
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,540
this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and the Lord delivered him, listen, from all

665
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,020
of his fears, from all of his troubles.

666
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
Praise God.

667
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:16,500
But he says, the righteous cry, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them and delivereth

668
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:23,140
them, the righteous, out of all their troubles.

669
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:30,300
Listen, this morning, we can rejoice in what God did in the life of David, but we must

670
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,420
recognize that we serve the same God.

671
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,540
The Lord God omnipotent, the one who's able.

672
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,380
You say, but I got a problem.

673
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,940
I know the problem solver, if I could use that terminology this morning, with all reverence.

674
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:53,779
This morning, I understand we have troubles, I understand we have fears, we have difficulties,

675
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:57,940
but we serve the Lord God Almighty and he's able.

676
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:05,119
And what you believe to be true about God and what I believe to be true about God must

677
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,940
have an impact on my prayer life.

678
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,420
And I would submit to you as I started my way of introduction this morning, as I've

679
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:19,739
said so many times over the years, what you believe to be true impacts your behavior.

680
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:29,500
But it's equally true that your behavior reveals what you believe to be true.

681
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:40,720
I wonder this morning, if we were to honestly evaluate our prayer lives, would it reveal

682
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,520
that we believe that God is great?

683
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,220
Are we praying for the impossible?

684
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,059
I mean from a human perspective.

685
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,619
They're just too far gone.

686
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,940
Do you know the Savior?

687
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,820
Do you know what he's capable of doing?

688
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,820
Do you know his grace?

689
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,820
Do you know his mercy?

690
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,980
Listen, I'm thankful that he's long-suffering.

691
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,459
And by the way, you're thankful he's long-suffering when he's dealing with you as well.

692
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:09,739
Amen?

693
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,899
Listen, this morning we serve a great God.

694
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:17,899
We've dealt with it all year, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

695
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:23,899
But the impact that God's greatness has in our lives should be evidenced in our prayer

696
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:24,899
lives.

697
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:28,779
We're going to look at two more examples over the next couple of weeks of how the greatness

698
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:31,860
of God will impact our prayer lives.

699
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,020
And we're going to stick on this subject for a few weeks.

700
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,020
Why?

701
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,020
Because it's so necessary.

702
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:45,179
Listen, our God, the hand of God moves through the prayers of his people.

703
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:51,140
J. Sidlow Baxter made this statement about the prayers of man, and he said, listen, men,

704
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:57,300
they may spurn our appeal, they may refuse our words, but they're entirely hopeless against

705
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,420
our prayers.

706
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,540
I shared with you a testimony on Wednesday evening a couple of weeks ago about a man,

707
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,940
and I'll be generic because we're on live stream, I shared it during prayer time on

708
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:18,179
Wednesday evening about a man that for multiple times said, don't pray for me.

709
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:24,179
But the reality was that he really knew that the prayers that we were praying were having

710
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,820
an impact.

711
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,700
And quite honestly, he didn't like it, so he just wanted us to stop praying because

712
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,179
God was convicting him.

713
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:37,739
He needed to be saved.

714
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:43,300
That man's trust in Christ as a savior called me three weeks ago and said, pastor, will

715
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,779
you pray for me?

716
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,940
He's not here today, he hasn't been here in a while.

717
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,260
Would you pray for me?

718
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,260
What changed?

719
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,660
He's been saved and he knows the power of prayer.

720
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,260
Listen, we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

721
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:05,059
And what we believe to be true will impact our behavior.

722
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:06,059
What is your prayer life?

723
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:11,339
What does my prayer life reveal about what we believe to be true about God?

724
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:14,459
David's prayer life revealed that he knew God was able.

725
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:19,600
He knew God was the Prince of Peace, that He could give him peace with all those fears.

726
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,860
He knew that God was able to do what he could not do.

727
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,899
This morning I'm so thankful that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

728
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:27,899
Let's pray.

729
00:48:27,899 --> 00:48:28,899
Father, we love you.

730
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:29,899
We thank you for loving us.

731
00:48:29,899 --> 00:48:34,419
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

732
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:44,419
So often, I've admitted from this pulpit that it's easier to preach and talk about

733
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:50,739
prayer than it is to actually pray.

734
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:58,700
God I pray that we'd be people of the book, but I pray that we'd be people of prayer.

735
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:05,859
God I pray that our prayer lives would truly reveal what we believe to be true about you.

736
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,460
We've studied so many things.

737
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,220
We agree with the psalmist when he said, I know the Lord is great.

738
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:21,619
That truth of your greatness must impact our behavior, must impact how we pray.

739
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:26,940
Lord I pray that we truly examine ourselves, examine our prayer lives.

740
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:33,179
I pray that you'd guide us and direct us, Lord, help us to be men and women of prayer.

741
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:44,299
I believe it was the Queen of Scotland that feared more than any army the prayers of John Knox.

742
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:47,979
What a testimony.

743
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:50,900
God, I pray that we'd be people of prayer.

744
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,419
Would you move and work?

745
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:54,900
If there's one that's not saved, Lord, we'd love to take a Bible and show them how they

746
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,940
can know for sure that heaven is their home.

747
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,940
Lord, help us to do business with you this morning in these few moments of invitation.

748
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,340
Well, thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
