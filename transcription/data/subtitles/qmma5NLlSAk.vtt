00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The book of Psalms, if you will, this morning, Psalm 34.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.300
We'll be looking at the 34th Psalm, and we'll be looking at several verses within the psalm.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.579
Not the entirety of the psalm, but we will kind of bounce through the portion of Scripture

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.920
this morning.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.579
And I have often said over the years that what we believe to be true will impact how

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.659
we behave.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.420
What you believe will impact how you behave.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.000
I believe that snakes, especially poisonous snakes, are dangerous.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.979
So therefore, I stay away from them.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.779
I don't need to find out by experience that their bite is going to hurt and possibly kill

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:42.779
me.

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.259
And we believe certain things.

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:45.259
I believe in gravity.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.700
How many of you believe in gravity?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.779
And there are reasons when you are off of the ground.

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:54.779
Why?

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:58.180
Because you believe in gravity, so it impacts your behavior.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.819
And we understand that to be true in life experiences, but we find this morning that

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.239
what we believe to be true about God will impact how we behave.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.779
I've often said this as well.

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:16.980
It's equally true that how we behave reveals what we really believe.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.459
How you behave reveals what you believe.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.819
In fact, there are times in life that we could say to someone, don't tell me what you

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:26.819
believe.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.500
I'll just observe for a little while, and I'll be able to pretty much conclude what

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
you believe.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Why?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.180
Because our behavior will reveal what we believe.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.260
Throughout this year, 2023, we have examined the character and nature of our God, and we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.160
wholeheartedly agree with the psalmist when he proclaims that great is the Lord.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.379
We serve a great God.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.779
He is the God that created all things.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.220
He's the God that sustains all things.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.540
He is my Redeemer, my Savior.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540
He's my friend.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.540
He cares about me.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.779
He loves me.

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.339
He is a great God.

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:03.459
He has all power.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.940
He has all wisdom.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.660
He's everywhere present.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.080
And we've had the opportunity through 2023 to really consider and discover how great

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.600
our God is.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.960
And I wholeheartedly agree with the psalmist when he says, I know that the Lord is great.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.559
And I hope this morning, after sitting through so many messages this year, maybe this is

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.360
the first time you're with us this morning, we have some folks visiting with us.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.059
And I hope that you know, though you have not heard all of the sermons that I've preached

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:40.279
this year, that you too know and agree that God is great.

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:45.660
We consider the greatness of God and we are in, obviously as we look at the scriptures,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.539
we see it throughout the pages of scripture, God's greatness being revealed to us.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.080
But as we've studied and we've been able to have the opportunity to understand in a greater

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.600
detail how great our God is, I believe that that belief should impact our behavior.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:14.279
The reality is that how I live my life is greatly impacted by what I believe about God.

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.440
This morning, as we consider over the next several weeks, really throughout the end of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.520
the year, we're going to consider how God's greatness should impact my behavior.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.559
How does the truth that God is great impact how you live?

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.880
How does it impact how I live?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.360
What we know to be true about God, does it impact how I live my life daily?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.199
And how does it impact how we live our lives daily?

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:44.000
For the next couple of weeks, we're going to look at this truth and be aware of the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.320
subject matter that is before us and understanding that God's greatness should have an impact

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.240
on how we pray, how we pray.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.880
You know, prayer is a unique privilege for every child of God.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.039
In fact, we've been invited, an invitation has been extended to us to come boldly before

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.960
the throne of grace.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.839
We find that our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:17.440
We find that there's one God and one mediator, the man Christ Jesus.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.920
I'm thankful that I have direct access to the throne room of heaven, that at any time,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.920
for any reason, I can enter into the presence of the almighty God and pray.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.920
That is a unique privilege for every child of God.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.859
I would say that oftentimes, if we're not careful, it is a neglected privilege.

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:45.040
Many of us, if we'd be honest this morning, that our prayer lives are lacking.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.000
For many of us, if we'd be transparent this morning, we would say the area of my Christian

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.880
life that really needs the most work is my prayer life.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.320
Prayer is work, prayer is labor.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.239
There are, listen, Satan doesn't like it when you pray, he doesn't like it when I pray,

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:07.920
he attacks, but I believe this morning that when we truly understand the greatness of

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.540
our God, that it will impact how we pray.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.799
I wonder this morning, I don't want you to answer me, I don't want you to even answer

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:22.799
me later if you really feel the need to, I'd be certainly willing to hear you, but

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:27.200
I'm curious this morning, if we're to think about our prayer lives, what is it that you're

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200
praying about?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.480
What is it that I'm praying about right now today that only God can do?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.019
That only God can do?

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:43.160
Sometimes our prayer lives can just be so shallow, just so temporal, of various things

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:46.519
But I wonder this morning, how are we praying?

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:48.040
What is it that you're praying about?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.140
What is it that I'm praying about that's something that only God can do?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.000
In other words, when God does it, it's extremely obvious and it's certain that we would only

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.079
be able to give God the honor and glory because we'd look at it and say, God did that.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:06.079
That's beyond anything that I could do.

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:09.600
It's beyond what any of us could do collectively.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600
God did it.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.559
And I just wonder this morning, what are we praying about?

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.839
What are we, God talks about, prove me in the book of Malachi, contextually with regard

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.000
to giving, but he says, prove me.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.200
Listen, we serve the almighty God and he's able to do wonderful things.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.920
As we look at Psalm 34, there's a phrase that I've used for our title this morning, this

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.799
poor man cried.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:33.799
This poor man cried.

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:38.720
As we look at the 34th Psalm this morning, I want you to see how that David's belief

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.000
about God impacted his prayer life.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.920
What he believed to be true about God impacted his prayer life.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.399
Notice with me in verse number one of Psalm 34, the Bible says, I will bless the Lord

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.399
at all times.

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:57.799
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:00.359
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:02.760
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.640
Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.320
I saw the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.200
They looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.160
This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.119
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them.

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:33.679
Notice verse eight, oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:37.519
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.399
I hope this morning that you know that the Lord is good.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:44.160
I hope you know that he is good no matter what the circumstances are that you're facing

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160
in life.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.359
God is good and he is a good God.

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:49.359
He's a gracious God.

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:50.839
He's a merciful God.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.200
He's a great God.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.480
And the Bible says, blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.399
God wants us to trust him, to believe him.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:02.040
And as we look at this portion of scripture this morning, we consider this thought with

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:08.359
regard to what we believe about God will impact how we pray, will impact our prayer lives.

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:12.959
I want you to notice in the life of David in these few verses, if you're, I'm gonna

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:17.959
answer three questions this morning, obvious questions, but I hope to be a help to you.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:23.640
Number one, if you're taking notes, to whom did David cry?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.920
To whom did David cry?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.519
Well, the Bible says in verse number one that he says, I will bless the Lord at all times.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:35.960
And so we find that he blessed the Lord according to verse number one, he gives further explanation

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.760
that his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.200
Listen, I hope this morning that you live a life of praise.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.280
I hope this morning that you understand that there are countless, I mean, just the number

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.960
of reasons that we have to praise our God.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.400
He is worthy of our praise.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.440
And here the Psalmist says, David says his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.559
And by the way, he'd rather hear your praise than complain.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.919
Amen.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:07.400
And by the way, he hears you when you complain and when you praise.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.919
And you can look at that in the scriptures and find the Bible says the people complained

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.599
and the Lord heard them there in the Pentateuch.

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:18.659
And we find here that David is saying, I'm blessing the Lord.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:22.039
Notice in verse number two, he says that he's boasting in the Lord.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:25.599
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.880
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.400
I believe this is the idea of exalting and magnifying the Lord.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.880
What a blessing to boast in the Lord.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.080
Listen, a lot of people that want to boast about themselves.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.880
They want to talk about how good they are and how wonderful they are and how blessed

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.039
we are to know them and to be in their presence and so on and so forth.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:45.799
But I want you to understand this morning that we serve a great God and we ought to

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.880
be boasting in our God.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.960
We ought to be talking about how wonderful our God is.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.280
We ought to be exalting him.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.080
The Bible says that John the Baptist said he must increase and I must decrease.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.000
And we find that the psalmist is boasting in the Lord.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.259
Number three, he's magnifying the Lord

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:04.900
and he even extends an invitation to others.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.739
He says, oh, magnify the Lord with me

00:10:08.739 --> 00:10:11.819
and let us exalt his name together.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.319
There's something awesome about corporate worship.

00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:16.379
There's something amazing about the opportunity.

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:18.180
Listen, every day of your life,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.020
you have the privilege of being able to enter

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.540
personally, privately into the presence of God

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.659
to magnify and exalt his name.

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:27.379
But when we gather together as the saints of God

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:31.100
to corporately magnify the Lord together,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.500
there's something mighty sweet about that.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.619
There's something that's a blessing about corporate worship

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.220
and what a blessing that we have

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.860
to magnify the Lord together.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.599
And David's saying to those,

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:46.180
come magnify the Lord with me.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.580
Let us exalt his name together.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.500
Notice in verse number four, the Bible says,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.540
I sought the Lord.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.700
I sought the Lord.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.939
Are you seeking the Lord?

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.740
Notice the Bible says, and he heard me.

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:04.260
We find that in verse number six,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.260
it says this poor man cried and the Lord heard him.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.940
So I believe that in verse number four

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.080
and again in verse number six,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.019
when David says, I sought the Lord,

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:16.040
when David says this poor man cried,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.300
that what he's referring to in verse number four

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.260
and verse number six is prayer.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.180
Because in both instances, David says the Lord heard him.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.180
And so he says, I sought the Lord and he heard me.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.180
This poor man cried and the Lord heard him.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.300
Listen, I'm so thankful for the Bible truth

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.260
that God hears us when we pray.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.500
I'm so thankful that God has given us example

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.339
after example.

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:43.220
I think of Solomon when he prayed to dedicate the temple.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.059
And after that long prayer that's recorded,

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.459
that God responds to Solomon and says,

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:51.580
I have heard thy prayer.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.839
I'm thankful that God tells Jeremiah,

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:57.400
call unto me and I will answer thee

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.559
and show thee great and mighty things,

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.779
which thou knowest not.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:02.440
The Bible speaks about, I love the Lord.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.279
Why?

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.099
Because he heard me.

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.300
He hears my voice.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.639
He hears my prayer.

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.779
What a blessing.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:12.000
And when I asked the question, to whom did he, David, cry?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.839
He cried to the Lord.

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.320
He cried to the Lord.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.639
He's blessing the Lord.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.839
He's boasting in the Lord.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.139
He's magnifying the Lord.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.479
He's seeking the Lord.

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:23.919
It says in verse number six, this poor man cried.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:27.160
It does not say this poor man cried unto the Lord,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.320
but I think it's abundantly obvious in verse number six

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.720
that he was crying unto the Lord.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.220
He was seeking and praying to the God of the universe.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.600
Listen, we must never forget this morning

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.039
that our prayer is directed to our living savior,

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:45.759
that our prayer is directed to the Lord.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:48.639
If you notice in your Bibles this morning,

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.919
if you have a King James Bible,

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:55.080
the word Lord in each of these verses is all caps.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.960
That's signifying that it's Jehovah God,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.720
the self-existent one.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.720
And we begin to think about to whom David is praying,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.440
and we think about and we understand this morning

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.960
that he's praying to the creator of the universe.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.720
He's praying to the one that created everything

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.039
out of nothing.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.720
He's praying to the one that said,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.399
let there be light, and there was light.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:25.160
He's praying to the one that the Bible recounts

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.559
as his work of creation and seeing the stars

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.720
that he made the stars also,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.479
that he made man in his own image.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:34.639
And you begin to think about the power

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.300
that's displayed through creation,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.839
the wisdom that's displayed through creation,

00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:41.759
and David is praying to the Lord.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:46.300
And this morning, you too are praying to the Lord.

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.539
I think about this morning as we understand

00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:52.740
the almighty God, El Shaddai,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.619
as he introduces himself to Abram there in Genesis 17.

00:13:57.619 --> 00:14:00.100
He is the almighty, the omnipotent,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.699
the omniscient, the omnipresent God.

00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:05.600
He is the one who rules and reigns.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.539
He is the one that conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:10.740
He is the one that lives forevermore.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.179
He says in the book of Revelation,

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:15.580
I was dead, but I'm alive forevermore.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.179
I think about the truth that this morning,

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:19.820
when you pray and when I pray,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.059
when I spent time this morning in prayer,

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:24.459
I wasn't praying to some idol.

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:25.899
I wasn't praying to some image.

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.859
I wasn't praying to some dead deity.

00:14:27.859 --> 00:14:32.299
No, I was praying to the living God who hears me,

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:34.500
who's able to do exceeding abundantly

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.420
above all that I ask or think.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.480
And what a blessing to know

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.480
that David directed his prayer to God.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.480
This morning, to whom did he pray?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.160
I'm thankful that the God of the universe,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.239
the God who loves the world,

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:57.839
cares about you and me.

00:14:57.839 --> 00:14:59.839
He's an individual God.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.640
He knows your hurts.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.519
He knows your concerns.

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:06.119
He knows your problems.

00:15:06.119 --> 00:15:07.559
And he cares about you.

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:12.040
And he loves you in spite of all of that.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.440
And this morning, when we think about David

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.119
in this text of scripture,

00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:19.320
we find that he's seeking the Lord.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.959
See, I believe as we continue to look

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:23.679
through this passage of scripture,

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.359
we could answer this question,

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.959
number two, if you're taking notes,

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:31.959
why did David cry unto the Lord?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.480
We answer the question, to whom did David cry?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.799
He cried unto the Lord.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:39.239
But then we ask the question, why did he cry?

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:42.239
Why did David cry unto the Lord?

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:44.160
I think if we're not careful this morning

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.359
that our immediate answer

00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:47.839
or maybe the obvious surface answer

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:49.000
would be that we would say

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.480
that David cried unto the Lord

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.119
because he had problems.

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.720
David cried unto the Lord because he had troubles.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.279
But I would submit to you this morning

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.640
that if we were to dig deeper,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.000
if we were to think deeper

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.040
and really examine what's taking place

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.959
and giving an answer to that question,

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:04.760
I believe this morning that we would say

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.920
that David, the reason that he cried unto the Lord

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.279
is because of what he understood to be true

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.279
about the Lord.

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:15.160
See, he sought the Lord

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.279
because he believed that the Lord heard him.

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.279
He prayed, he cried unto the Lord

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.920
because he believed that God could do something

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.679
about his situation, about his circumstances.

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.079
He cries unto the Lord,

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.160
not just because of his troubles,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.119
not just because of his problems.

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:32.519
He directs his prayer to the Lord

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:35.959
because of what or who he understands God to be.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.959
We mentioned already that on two occasions

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.040
in verse four and verse six,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.959
the Bible says that the Lord heard him.

00:16:43.959 --> 00:16:45.720
And again, what a blessing that is

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.320
and the encouragement that we receive

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.720
from understanding that David sought the Lord,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.000
he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard him.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.200
But as we begin to think and answer this question,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.519
why did he cry unto the Lord?

00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:59.040
And if we only give that surface answer

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.079
with regard to because he had a problem,

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:02.920
well, we understand even in our lives,

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.000
our daily lives, that we have problems.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.160
We have issues.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.720
And there are times that we have to call upon someone

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.600
to give us assistance.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.239
Ms. Marjorie's dealing with a plumbing issue

00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:16.320
and she did not call an auto mechanic

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.679
for a plumbing issue.

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:20.519
Why?

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.760
You say, Pastor, that's kind of basic.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440
We understand that.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.200
Listen, when you have a plumbing issue, you call a plumber.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.519
You have an electrical issue, you call an electrician.

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:31.359
Am I right?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.600
Right, you have a problem.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.279
You have a toothache, you got a problem,

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:40.559
you go to the foot doctor.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.119
No.

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:43.519
You don't call the podiatrist

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:45.640
when you got a problem with a tooth.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.480
Why?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.720
Because they're not qualified.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.559
You say, but they're a doctor, but they're not qualified.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.040
That's not their area of expertise.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.000
Do you understand?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.480
Listen, we deal with this every day of our lives.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.480
Sometimes if we're not careful as Christians,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.320
we have problems in our lives when we call somebody,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.279
we try to get help from some source,

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.559
maybe a brother or sister in Christ, whatever it might be,

00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:07.959
but we try to get help, we need this help or that help,

00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:09.320
but I'm telling you this morning

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.720
that God is the one that we should pray to

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.160
because we understand who he is.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.239
David, in this area of his life,

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:21.519
in this time of difficulty and all that was taking place,

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:23.359
why did he cry unto the Lord?

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:24.959
Simply because he had a trouble?

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:25.799
No.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:29.559
Because he knew who God was.

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:32.520
And this morning, what leads you and I,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.919
what leads us in the time of our crisis,

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:37.919
in the time of difficulty to pray to God

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:40.039
is that we know who God is.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:41.880
What is it that impacts your prayer life?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.039
How is it that we have a prayer life this morning

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.919
that we spend time in prayer?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:51.960
Well, because of what we understand to be true about God.

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:54.960
When I understand who God is,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.000
when I understand what he is capable of doing,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.559
that is what leads me to a place

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:04.000
of seeking God's face through prayer.

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:08.679
See, if I really don't know the God of the Bible,

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:11.400
then why would I pray to the God of the Bible?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.559
If I don't know that he could do all things,

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:16.640
why am I going to ask him to do something

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.280
that's beyond what I could even believe?

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.760
This morning, David cried unto the Lord,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.080
not simply because of his troubles,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.119
not simply because of his problems,

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:34.119
he cried unto the Lord because he knew the Lord.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.799
He knew who God was.

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:40.400
He knew the character and the nature of God.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.280
This morning, begin to think about my prayer life,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.559
begin to think about your prayer life,

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.280
begin to examine your prayer life,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.359
and begin to take that examination,

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:52.599
say, how is my prayer life today?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.119
Do I really, does my prayer life really demonstrate?

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:10.199
does it really reveal that I believe that God is able? Does my prayer life really reveal

00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:17.599
that God is omniscient, that He's omnipotent? If I examine my prayer life, what does my

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:23.799
prayer life reveal about what I believe to be true about God?

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:28.279
The third question that we'll answer this morning and spend most of our time here is

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:34.239
this, if you're taking notes, number three, what was the result of his cry? What was the

00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:38.719
result of his cry? Well, we find in verse number four the Bible says, I sought the Lord

00:20:38.719 --> 00:20:44.999
and He heard me. Then notice the rest of verse number four, and delivered me from all my

00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:52.979
fears. We live in the midst of a people that at times will use this terminology. I remember

00:20:52.979 --> 00:20:57.419
years ago, and I'm getting older and older, and I'm realizing that as I interact with

00:20:57.419 --> 00:21:01.759
people and some of the things that I would think that happened just a few years ago

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:07.079
actually took place a whole lot longer than what I might remember. But the reality is

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:10.439
there used to be this, I don't even know if the clothing line is even around anymore,

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:14.419
but there was this, I remember in high school, no fear. You'd have these shirts that would

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:20.239
say no fear. And you would have this. And the reality is that though we live in the

00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:25.439
midst of a nation and a people that sometimes try to portray that idea, I'm not afraid

00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:38.379
of anything. We have a lot of fears. You know people fear the future. People fear the uncertainties.

00:21:38.379 --> 00:21:44.019
People fear death. There are a lot of people that fear death. It's a natural thing to fear

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:49.619
death unless you've been saved by the blood of the Lamb. According to Hebrews 2, He's

00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:53.739
delivered us from that fear. Why? Because I know that to be absent from the body is

00:21:53.739 --> 00:22:01.059
to be present with the Lord. I remember being afraid of dying before I got saved. What I'm

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:03.899
saying to you this morning is that there's a lot of people in our world that have a lot

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:12.720
of fears. There's a lot of fear in our society. And David, for whatever reason, and you can

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:20.000
look at various ideas as to when it was that David actually penned this psalm, and regardless

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.759
of the particular timing, it seems quite obvious, whether it's the exact timing, that

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:30.360
it definitely was during the time in which he was running from Saul. Remember Saul was

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.479
seeking to kill David. And Saul not only desired to kill David himself, but he tried to get

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:40.279
his servants to kill David. He tried to employ the mighty men that he had in his army to

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:44.519
kill David. And David's on the run and all these things are taking place. And David says

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:48.759
this at one point as he meets with Samuel. He says, there's but a step between me and

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:53.639
death. And you begin to think about the turmoil and the difficulties in which David was facing.

00:22:53.639 --> 00:23:00.000
And we find that here, the Bible says in verse number four, one of the results of David crying

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.679
unto the Lord, seeking the Lord, is that he, the Lord, delivered me from all my fears.

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:14.360
How is that possible? Listen, I can't deliver you from your fears. You can have fears and

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.479
you can come to me and say, pastor, I need your help. But the reality this morning is

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:26.559
that I am not capable of delivering you from your fears. But I know the one who can. And

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:32.239
one of the names that's ascribed to our God is that he is the Prince of Peace. He's the

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:38.119
Prince of Peace. We find that he gives peace. We understand that the Bible speaks about

00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:44.399
great peace, have they which love thy law. The Bible speaks about God keeping us in his

00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:51.360
peace as we keep our minds stayed upon him. And he is the Lord Jehovah. We find that he

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.759
is the Prince of Peace and he gives his children peace. We're able to have in the midst of

00:23:56.759 --> 00:24:01.319
turmoil and difficulty and all of the things that are taking place in our lives and our

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:08.279
world today, we can have peace. God can deliver you from those things that might bring fear

00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:15.399
in your life. Why? Because he is the giver of peace. This morning we understand and we'll

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:22.119
look at two aspects of this. The Bible speaks about having peace with God. And I'll say

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:27.320
this from Romans chapter 5 and verse number 1, there's only one way to have peace with

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.440
God and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ. There are times in your life, no doubt, there

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.239
are times in my life that I've heard people say something like this when I've spoken to

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:41.160
them about eternity and about death and they'll say something like this, I've made my peace

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.959
with God. Have you ever heard somebody use that phraseology? And I'll say to them, well

00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:50.119
based upon what the Bible teaches, there's only one way to make peace with God and that's

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:57.040
through Jesus Christ. Often in my life I have experienced as people have used that terminology,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.040
that is not what they meant when they said they've made their peace with God. But I'm

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:06.679
thankful to have peace with God. I'm thankful that because of the Lord Jesus Christ and

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:11.919
his substitutionary atonement on a cruel cross nearly 2,000 years ago that he offers peace

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:16.720
through his blood and we can have peace with God. Listen, we were enemies of God. We were

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.720
at odds with God but he reconciled us, he redeemed us and we now have peace with God

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:31.760
if we've been born again. But there's also the peace of God. The peace of God is the

00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:38.000
different than peace with God. The peace of God is something that you experience daily

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.199
in your lives. As you walk in the Spirit, the Bible says the fruit of the Spirit is

00:25:42.199 --> 00:25:49.199
love, joy, peace. That's what the Bible teaches us. The fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace.

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:56.479
And he gives us peace. Jesus said this in the book of John, in John chapter number 14

00:25:56.479 --> 00:26:00.799
and what a blessing to think about this portion of scripture and you know that as you start

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:05.199
John 14, Jesus, he'd given some instruction in chapter number 13. He gave him the new

00:26:05.199 --> 00:26:11.119
commandment about loving one another as he loved and we find that he then, as he had

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:15.760
given him information with regard to the cross that was just on the horizon, he says, let

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:22.160
not your heart be troubled. Why would Jesus say that to the disciples? Because they had

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.959
troubled hearts. He says, let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also

00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:32.559
in me. In my Father's house are many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you. I

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:37.359
go to prepare a place for you and if I go, I will come again. Aren't you thankful for

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:43.279
that wonderful promise? And receive you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:47.720
And he gave us that promise and he gives them that truth of not being troubled. But then

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.959
in verse number 27 of John 14, notice what Jesus says. Jesus says this to these disciples.

00:26:53.959 --> 00:27:02.880
He says, peace I leave with you. And then notice this, my peace. You know some of the

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:12.760
modern translations take out that word my. Listen, I'm thankful to have God's peace.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.239
The world tries to offer peace. You know what the world thinks about peace? It's the absence

00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:25.320
of trouble. The world seems to think that peace is the absence of conflict. Am I right?

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.519
That's the world's ideology of what peace is. If I can come to a place of being void

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:38.519
of trouble and problem and conflict, then and only then I will have peace. I disagree.

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:45.279
We can have peace in the midst of great turmoil because we can have the peace of God. And

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:50.820
here's what Jesus says, peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you. Not as the

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.399
world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled. Notice what it says, let

00:27:55.399 --> 00:28:03.799
neither let it be afraid. What is it that David said? He said, I sought the Lord and

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:12.760
the Lord heard me and he delivered me, what, from all my fears. And here we find that Jesus,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.679
he says let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Why? Because I'm giving

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:22.000
you my peace. We find that the Bible teaches us in the book of Colossians that we're to

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.919
let the peace of God rule in our hearts. And you think about that decision of allowing

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:35.799
God's peace to rule in our hearts, we get the idea of the word umpire from that particular

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:41.320
word in the Greek and the idea of ruling. And often, no doubt, you've watched sporting

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:45.320
events at some point in your life and when you watch those sporting events, there's some

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:51.159
people that are on the particular field or in the arena or on the court, whatever the

00:28:51.159 --> 00:28:57.679
particular sporting event that you're watching, and there's somebody that is the authority,

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:03.799
somebody that has the rule on that particular event. Normally, they're dressed a little

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:08.479
bit differently. You see them with stripes sometimes. They're referees and I remember

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:13.919
playing baseball, that was my main sport, and we'd call the umpire blue because often

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:19.119
they wore blue and we'd refer to them in that fashion. And listen, it doesn't matter how

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:24.479
much you argue and how much you debate, the reality is that they are the authority. You

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:29.119
say, pastor, they can now challenge calls. I understand because they are not perfect,

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:34.640
but our God is perfect. And he gives us a peace that is perfect and he says that we're

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:40.380
to let God's peace rule in our hearts. You say, pastor, did you see the headlines? Did

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.719
you see what's going on? Did you see this? What are we going to do about that? And what

00:29:43.719 --> 00:29:50.719
about this? Let the peace of God rule in your hearts. David said I sought the Lord and He

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:59.679
heard me and He delivered me from all my fears. If it's causing you to be afraid, if it's

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:00.880
causing you to be afraid, if it's causing you to be afraid, if it's causing you to

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.299
be afraid, if it's causing you to be afraid, then you're in trouble.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:08.619
to be anxious. God offers you the peace, His peace. We need to get in time with God. We

00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:16.019
need to pray and seek His face and know that He's able. Why did David seek the Lord? Because

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:22.339
he knew God. He knew who God was. He knows who He is. You and I this morning, why do

00:30:22.339 --> 00:30:29.179
we seek God? Because we know who He is. And then we'd say because we have fears. And He's

00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:33.459
the Prince of Peace and He will give us peace. Notice with me in verse number 6, the Bible

00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:38.499
says this there in Psalm 34, in verse number 6, not only did He say in verse number 4,

00:30:38.499 --> 00:30:42.939
I sought the Lord and He heard me and delivered me from all my fears. But notice also in verse

00:30:42.939 --> 00:30:52.739
number 6, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.

00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:57.619
Do you have any troubles this morning? You say, Pastor, I don't have enough time. Neither

00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:05.459
do I. Amen. But the reality is that man that's born of woman is a few days and full of trouble.

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:12.019
We have troubles, difficulties. Paul says it this way, there's a great and effectual

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:21.579
door that was opened but there are many adversaries. The work of God has always met with adversity.

00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:27.419
Why? Because we have an enemy. Because we have an enemy. You read the book of Ezra and

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:35.499
Nehemiah. They're trying to do a work for God and they're met with adversity over and

00:31:35.499 --> 00:31:41.139
over. You read the early church in the book of Acts as the history is provided to us as

00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:45.939
they're seeking to go and give the gospel, they're met with adversity. And so we find

00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:50.779
that David here, because of the circumstances in which he's dealing with but greater because

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:55.539
of he knows who God is, he cries unto the Lord and the Bible tells us again that the

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:59.779
Lord heard him but it tells us the result of David crying unto the Lord was that the

00:31:59.779 --> 00:32:09.179
Lord saved him out of all his troubles. You know we have troubles in our lives that only

00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:17.979
God can deliver us from. That only God can save us from. I think about the disciples

00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:22.259
when they're there in the storm and Jesus is going to walk by. There's a couple of

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:25.699
different instances. There's one when he's in the boat asleep but there's another one

00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:30.219
when they're in a storm and he's going to walk by. And the Bible tells us this, it's

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:37.739
a fascinating terminology that they were toiling and rowing. I hope your mind can get the picture

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:43.019
of that. If you're, I mean as much as you can possibly try to go and you're not making

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:50.339
any progress because the storm was so great they just couldn't get to where they were

00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:55.979
trying to get to. They were toiling and rowing. Have you ever been there in life? I mean maybe

00:32:55.979 --> 00:33:04.059
not on a body of water in a vessel but in life you've been toiling and rowing. And I

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:10.419
believe that Jesus, I believe that he would have passed right on by if they didn't invite

00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:16.379
him on the vessel. You know why I believe that? Because God doesn't force himself upon

00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:27.459
you or upon me. If you want to toil and rowing, sometimes he'll let you. But I'd rather invite

00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:34.259
him in and see what he can do. Because he can do greater than I can do. He can do greater

00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:38.619
than you can do. Why does David call on the Lord in the midst of his trouble? Because

00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:43.979
he knows that he's the Lord God Almighty. He knows what God is able to do. He's experienced.

00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:48.299
Listen, David, he testifies when he stands before Saul long before he's ever running

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:55.779
from Saul. He testifies before Saul as to the greatness of God. David, you're not able

00:33:55.779 --> 00:34:00.899
to go fight against Goliath. I mean you're but a youth and he's a man of war from his

00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:10.019
days. David, you can't do this. And David said, my God will deliver him into my hand.

00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:17.459
There was a time when I was watching the flock. You understand what David testified, right?

00:34:17.459 --> 00:34:27.859
He knew Jehovah God. And so in the midst of his troubles he prays to God because he knows

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:36.500
who God is. And when he prays to God he says God heard him. And he says that God delivered

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.419
him, saved him out of all his troubles. Listen, this morning nothing's too hard for the Lord.

00:34:42.419 --> 00:34:47.940
You say, pastor, I've got this problem. I mean it's just a mountain. It's not too hard

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:57.299
for God. It's not too hard for God. There's nothing impossible with God. I'm thankful

00:34:57.299 --> 00:35:02.139
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. I'm thankful

00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:06.179
this morning that when he said that he's the Lord God Almighty, he then asked the question,

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:09.339
is anything too hard for the Lord? Listen, there are some things in your life and there

00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:14.339
are some things in my life that are too hard for us. You might be in the midst and experience

00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:18.940
something right now. You say, this is beyond me. This is beyond me. I can't do this. You're

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:28.139
right. But God can. He wants you to seek him. He wants you to believe him. And this

00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:33.379
morning when we begin to think about the prayer life of David as outlined here in Psalm 34,

00:35:33.379 --> 00:35:38.819
and as he says, I mean it starts with adoration and praise and rejoicing, but he's seeking

00:35:38.819 --> 00:35:43.819
the Lord. He's crying unto the Lord and he gives us that wonderful truth that God heard

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:50.179
him and God delivered him. This morning, as we begin to think about this result for

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:55.139
David in his life and how he experienced the mighty hand of God, and again, we do not know

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:59.979
for certainty exactly the timing, but if you were to look through that portion of time

00:35:59.979 --> 00:36:04.059
in David's life as it's recorded for us in the book of 1 Samuel, you have the opportunity

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:11.019
to see a number of times in which God delivered him miraculously. Where God intervened and

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:17.819
God did something that David could not orchestrate. See, sometimes in life we try to kind of orchestrate

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:23.379
some things. We try to manipulate some things. We try to help work some things together.

00:36:23.379 --> 00:36:28.099
But the reality is it's pretty sweet to see what God can do. Because God can do what we

00:36:28.099 --> 00:36:32.619
cannot do and there are times in life, listen, there are times that sometimes if we're not

00:36:32.619 --> 00:36:36.859
careful, we try to help God out. We pray and we try to give God the solution. Have you

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:40.779
ever been guilty of that? Say, God, here's my problem and here's a good way that you

00:36:40.819 --> 00:36:47.619
could solve it for me. Let him be God. He's God. He knows better than you do. Notice a

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:53.339
quick example in 1 Samuel 23 if you want to turn back there. Just one example of a miraculous

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:58.500
way in which God delivered David. Again, I don't know the exact timing of the writing

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.459
of Psalm 34. There's some debate out there with regard to when it actually took place,

00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:07.579
but it seems quite obvious and there's a level of agreement that it was during the time in

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:13.220
which David was running from Saul. And 1 Samuel 23 is one of those instances. It begins

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.459
when David was in a place, the Keilah, where the Philistines went against Keilah and David

00:37:18.459 --> 00:37:23.079
inquired of the Lord and sought the Lord with regard to going and delivering this particular

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:29.699
city from the attack of the Philistines and God tells him to do so. And after David is

00:37:29.699 --> 00:37:35.579
there, Saul finds out that David is in that place and he has this idea that he now can

00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:42.139
have an opportunity to catch and kill David because of where he was located. And David

00:37:42.139 --> 00:37:46.819
begins to inquire of the Lord because David heard that Saul was going to come and that

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:53.019
was seeking to destroy him and David asked the Lord if Saul was going to come and God

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:57.459
said yes, Saul's going to come. And then David asked the Lord if the people, the inhabitants

00:37:57.459 --> 00:38:01.979
of Keilah, the men that he just delivered from the Philistines, if they would deliver

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:07.699
him to Saul and God says yes, they will. Can you imagine that? The people that you

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:13.539
just rescued are going to turn you over to the one that wants to kill you. That's what's

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:18.659
happening in the beginning of 1 Samuel 23. David, he leaves and he's going out in the

00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:24.659
wilderness, the wilderness of Ziph and he's there and we find that Saul makes this statement

00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:31.039
at the end of verse 23, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:36.000
In verse 25 it says that his men, Saul also and his men went out to seek David, to seek

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.399
him. We find that they're maneuvering for position if you will. In verse 26 the Bible

00:38:41.399 --> 00:38:46.119
says that Saul went on this side of the mountain and David and his men on that side of the

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:52.000
mountain and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. What did God deliver David

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.320
from according to verse number 4 of our text? All of his what? Fears. Verse number 6, all

00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:04.239
of his troubles. And it says here in verse number 6 of our text of scripture in 1 Samuel

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:10.479
23 that David made haste to get away for fear of Saul. For Saul, notice the end of verse

00:39:10.479 --> 00:39:15.599
26, and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. I mean he's surrounded,

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:22.599
he's in a bad situation. He's afraid. Again, I don't know with certainty that this is where

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:30.599
the prayer of Psalm 34 came from, but it certainly fits. The Bible says in verse 27, but there

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:38.359
came a messenger. There came a messenger unto Saul. You see what's happening before this

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:45.519
messenger comes? What's David, David's running? What's Saul's purpose? I'm going to destroy

00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:52.519
him, I'm going to kill him. He's not going to surround him. And a messenger comes. A

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:57.760
messenger comes. And the Bible says in verse 27, the messenger came to Saul saying, notice

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.880
what the messenger says, haste thee and come.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.600
For the Philistines have invaded the land."

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600
Who's Saul?

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.600
Well, he's the king.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.280
He's got a responsibility.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.840
And the Philistines have invaded the land.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840
Why?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.000
Because Saul's out there hunting David, trying to kill David.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.320
And the messenger comes.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:26.040
As David and his men are surrounded, the messenger arrives.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.960
And the Bible says the messenger says, haste thee.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.420
I mean, there's no time to waste.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.160
The Philistines have already invaded the land.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.680
I would submit to you that this happened well in advance of the messenger arriving.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.520
They had time to travel and what have you, and news did not spread like it does today.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.120
And there had to be some time that passed.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.560
And the Bible says in verse 28, wherefore, notice what the Bible says, Saul returned

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.600
from pursuing after David.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.500
And I tell you this morning that David could not have brought that to pass.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.400
Only God could do that.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.840
And God worked in such a way in David's life.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840
Why?

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.180
Because David prayed.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.180
David sought the Lord.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.520
David cried unto the Lord.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.520
Again, whether this timing is exactly the timing of Psalm 34 is not the point that

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.800
I'm seeking to make this morning.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:22.160
I'm simply saying to you this morning that David understood that God is able, that David

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.080
understood that God could work beyond what he could even imagine.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:34.680
God could use a messenger because the Philistines invaded the land to have Saul return from

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.760
pursuing after him.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.480
We serve a great God who's able to do all things.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.200
How does it impact our prayer life?

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.680
How does it impact us?

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:51.320
Do we pray like we serve an omnipotent God?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:58.320
Do we pray like we serve an omniscient God?

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.340
How does what we believe about God impact our prayer lives?

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.960
I want to close with a wonderful truth from Psalm 34.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.279
As we examine the life of David in these first several verses of Psalm 34, the amazing thing

00:42:13.279 --> 00:42:20.600
to me and the application that I want us to walk away with this morning is that David

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:27.080
is sharing in the beginning of this portion of Scripture of Psalm 34 his personal experience.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.919
He says, I sought the Lord.

00:42:29.919 --> 00:42:33.279
He says, this poor man cried.

00:42:33.279 --> 00:42:38.200
He's speaking about his personal experience that I sought the Lord, I cried unto the Lord

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.360
and God heard me and God delivered me.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.200
He's giving a personal testimony.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.500
He's testifying of his personal experience.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:52.180
But I want you to take and look at verse 17 because in verse number 17, the Bible says

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.779
the righteous cry.

00:42:55.779 --> 00:42:56.779
Who's the righteous?

00:42:56.779 --> 00:43:01.100
Well, if you've been born again this morning, we sang a lot about being saved this morning.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.860
If you've been born again this morning, you are righteous before God.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.380
You are declared righteous.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.260
In fact, it's not your righteousness, it's his righteousness that's been imputed upon

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.260
you.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.340
The Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5 that he, God, hath made him Jesus

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:21.779
to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in

00:43:21.779 --> 00:43:22.779
him.

00:43:22.779 --> 00:43:26.860
What a blessing to be declared righteous.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:34.980
The Bible says that the righteous cry and notice the Lord heareth them, but it doesn't

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:43.260
stop there, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.419
Did you see it this morning in verse 17?

00:43:45.419 --> 00:43:49.059
I mean, listen, I'm thankful for David's personal testimony.

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:54.660
I'm thankful for David's personal experience that he says, I sought the Lord, that he says,

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.540
this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and the Lord delivered him, listen, from all

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.020
of his fears, from all of his troubles.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.020
Praise God.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:16.500
But he says, the righteous cry, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them and delivereth

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:23.140
them, the righteous, out of all their troubles.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:30.300
Listen, this morning, we can rejoice in what God did in the life of David, but we must

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.420
recognize that we serve the same God.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.540
The Lord God omnipotent, the one who's able.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.380
You say, but I got a problem.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:45.940
I know the problem solver, if I could use that terminology this morning, with all reverence.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:53.779
This morning, I understand we have troubles, I understand we have fears, we have difficulties,

00:44:53.779 --> 00:44:57.940
but we serve the Lord God Almighty and he's able.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:05.119
And what you believe to be true about God and what I believe to be true about God must

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:09.940
have an impact on my prayer life.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.420
And I would submit to you as I started my way of introduction this morning, as I've

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.739
said so many times over the years, what you believe to be true impacts your behavior.

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:29.500
But it's equally true that your behavior reveals what you believe to be true.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:40.720
I wonder this morning, if we were to honestly evaluate our prayer lives, would it reveal

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.520
that we believe that God is great?

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.220
Are we praying for the impossible?

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.059
I mean from a human perspective.

00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:53.619
They're just too far gone.

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:55.940
Do you know the Savior?

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.820
Do you know what he's capable of doing?

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:58.820
Do you know his grace?

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.820
Do you know his mercy?

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.980
Listen, I'm thankful that he's long-suffering.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.459
And by the way, you're thankful he's long-suffering when he's dealing with you as well.

00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:09.739
Amen?

00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:13.899
Listen, this morning we serve a great God.

00:46:13.899 --> 00:46:17.899
We've dealt with it all year, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:46:17.899 --> 00:46:23.899
But the impact that God's greatness has in our lives should be evidenced in our prayer

00:46:23.899 --> 00:46:24.899
lives.

00:46:24.899 --> 00:46:28.779
We're going to look at two more examples over the next couple of weeks of how the greatness

00:46:28.779 --> 00:46:31.860
of God will impact our prayer lives.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.020
And we're going to stick on this subject for a few weeks.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.020
Why?

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.020
Because it's so necessary.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:45.179
Listen, our God, the hand of God moves through the prayers of his people.

00:46:45.459 --> 00:46:51.140
J. Sidlow Baxter made this statement about the prayers of man, and he said, listen, men,

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:57.300
they may spurn our appeal, they may refuse our words, but they're entirely hopeless against

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.420
our prayers.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.540
I shared with you a testimony on Wednesday evening a couple of weeks ago about a man,

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.940
and I'll be generic because we're on live stream, I shared it during prayer time on

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:18.179
Wednesday evening about a man that for multiple times said, don't pray for me.

00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:24.179
But the reality was that he really knew that the prayers that we were praying were having

00:47:24.179 --> 00:47:26.820
an impact.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:31.700
And quite honestly, he didn't like it, so he just wanted us to stop praying because

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.179
God was convicting him.

00:47:33.179 --> 00:47:37.739
He needed to be saved.

00:47:37.739 --> 00:47:43.300
That man's trust in Christ as a savior called me three weeks ago and said, pastor, will

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.779
you pray for me?

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:48.940
He's not here today, he hasn't been here in a while.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.260
Would you pray for me?

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.260
What changed?

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.660
He's been saved and he knows the power of prayer.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.260
Listen, we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:05.059
And what we believe to be true will impact our behavior.

00:48:05.059 --> 00:48:06.059
What is your prayer life?

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:11.339
What does my prayer life reveal about what we believe to be true about God?

00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:14.459
David's prayer life revealed that he knew God was able.

00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:19.600
He knew God was the Prince of Peace, that He could give him peace with all those fears.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.860
He knew that God was able to do what he could not do.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.899
This morning I'm so thankful that we serve a God who hears and answers prayer.

00:48:26.899 --> 00:48:27.899
Let's pray.

00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:28.899
Father, we love you.

00:48:28.899 --> 00:48:29.899
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:34.419
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:44.419
So often, I've admitted from this pulpit that it's easier to preach and talk about

00:48:44.419 --> 00:48:50.739
prayer than it is to actually pray.

00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:58.700
God I pray that we'd be people of the book, but I pray that we'd be people of prayer.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:05.859
God I pray that our prayer lives would truly reveal what we believe to be true about you.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.460
We've studied so many things.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.220
We agree with the psalmist when he said, I know the Lord is great.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:21.619
That truth of your greatness must impact our behavior, must impact how we pray.

00:49:21.619 --> 00:49:26.940
Lord I pray that we truly examine ourselves, examine our prayer lives.

00:49:27.179 --> 00:49:33.179
I pray that you'd guide us and direct us, Lord, help us to be men and women of prayer.

00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:44.299
I believe it was the Queen of Scotland that feared more than any army the prayers of John Knox.

00:49:44.299 --> 00:49:47.979
What a testimony.

00:49:47.979 --> 00:49:50.900
God, I pray that we'd be people of prayer.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.419
Would you move and work?

00:49:52.419 --> 00:49:54.900
If there's one that's not saved, Lord, we'd love to take a Bible and show them how they

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.940
can know for sure that heaven is their home.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.940
Lord, help us to do business with you this morning in these few moments of invitation.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:05.340
Well, thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
