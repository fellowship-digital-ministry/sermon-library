1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
and the book of Leviticus is a rich book. I love the book of Leviticus and I think oftentimes if

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,880
we're not careful we can breeze through the book and think that really there's not a whole lot for

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,680
us and folks get excited with certain books of the Bible and then get bogged down with other

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,799
books of the Bible but all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable. I was

5
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:25,920
sharing with someone just in recent days how that many of the chapters of the book of Leviticus in

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,799
particular dealing with a number of the offerings and that sort of thing and how precious it is to

7
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:37,840
see how the Lord Jesus Christ completed in his single act of redemption fulfilled all aspects

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,159
of the various offerings and what a tremendous blessing that is. As we look at this passage I'm

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,759
going to share a few things with you by way of introduction and then we'll get into the verses

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,360
of scripture I trust to be a blessing to you. The reality is that each day I believe that I am more

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,560
and more convinced that we're living in the last days. Paul talked about the last days in particular

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,400
in second Timothy chapter number three and the truth of James in chapter number five the coming

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,680
of the Lord draweth nigh and I believe that and I believe that we are living in a time in which

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,839
we ought to be excited about the opportunities that are presenting themselves to us and it's

15
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:24,559
interesting when the prophet Isaiah was describing the society in which he was living and the times

16
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:31,760
in which he was called of God to minister he noted that they call evil good and good evil.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,680
You can read of that in Isaiah chapter number five a few chapters later in Isaiah chapter number 10

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,279
you will find that he makes this statement. He says that they decree unrighteous decrees. We've

19
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:49,839
often looked at that passage of scripture in Isaiah 10. We've talked about the way in which

20
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:57,360
they would legislate wickedness. They decree unrighteous decrees. The scriptures tell us that

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,639
our righteous God loveth righteousness. I'm thankful that our God is righteous. He's not becoming

22
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:10,960
righteous. He is righteous and he loveth righteousness and we read that in Psalm 11 in

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,000
verse number seven. If you look in Proverbs in chapter number 14 in verse 34 the Bible says that

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,440
righteousness exalteth a nation. This is this sin is a reproach to any people. Paul extended a call

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,679
to the believers in Corinth and said to those believers come out from among them and be separate.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,199
We find that Jesus in his priestly prayer in John chapter number 17 he makes the statement that we

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,839
are of the world but we're not in or excuse me we're in the world but we're not of the world

28
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,679
and what a blessing to understand that this world is not my home that I am just a passing through

29
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:55,039
that we are strangers in pilgrims that we are ambassadors. We find that the believers in

30
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,880
Philippi they were encouraged by the apostle Paul in Philippians 2 in verse 15 when he told them that

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,479
they were dwelling or living in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation but then he said this

32
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:14,479
among whom you shine as lights in the world. Peter would remind his readers of the importance

33
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,360
of being holy in all manner of conversation. You can read of that in first Peter 1 verses 14 through 16.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,559
When you read those verses of scripture you'll find that in verse number 16 the Bible says be

35
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:32,800
holy or as it is written be holy for I am holy. We know that this book of Leviticus that I've had

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,800
you turn to this evening that it's here in the book of Leviticus that God will deal with the

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,279
importance of holy living and the importance of living in a manner that would please our God and

38
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:50,639
our Savior. As I consider the few sampling of scriptures that I've shared with you this evening

39
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,279
by way of introduction I'm reminded this evening that we are not the first generation to live in

40
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:03,679
a wicked society and sometimes we can kind of get that idea that it's never been as bad as it is

41
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:11,279
today. God destroyed the world in Genesis because of the wickedness of the people, right? Noah's flood

42
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:18,160
and we understand that there were eight that were saved upon the ark but the wickedness of mankind

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,559
had reached a high point. We find that throughout the scriptures you can read of great wickedness

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,959
that takes place in a number of different cultures and societies and as you would consider with me

45
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,559
the the fact that yes we're living in the last days and yes when Paul would describe the last

46
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:41,440
days in second Timothy chapter number three he said that perilous times shall come he said that

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,600
evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived. It seems as if at

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,440
times in our lives we are thinking somehow that things are going to get better that there's going

49
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,239
to be some utopian type of view and everything's just going to be wonderful. God says in his word

50
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:07,920
that evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse but continue that's our responsibility

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,799
that's our charge. The reality is that as we look at the truth of the word of God and we understand

52
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:22,160
that we are not the first generation to live in a wicked society that I'm reminded that God has

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,600
given specific instruction to his people all throughout the history in various times and in

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,880
various places and of course we now have the whole canon of scripture that we can go to and be

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,600
encouraged by but in that specific instruction God provides us with truth that would enable us to live

56
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:51,040
godly in a wicked society. I don't know if you follow some of the social issues that are taking

57
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,320
place in our world today and I do not desire in any way shape or form to address the subject

58
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,359
matters in specific detail this evening or to deal with anything in a political type of a manner.

59
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:12,399
The reality is that it does not really matter how someone is described with a political party how

60
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:19,760
they align so on and so forth what matters is what they stand for. As we begin to I'm receiving

61
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,239
emails on a daily basis you understand that right now here in the Commonwealth of Virginia our state

62
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:31,119
legislation legislators are meeting down in Richmond they've they're actually kind of doing

63
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:36,799
some cyber meetings and what have you because of COVID but it's general session general assembly

64
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:43,040
time in the Commonwealth of Virginia and I'm getting regular updates sometimes multiple times

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,160
a day I am getting updates with regards to some of the laws bills I should say some of the bills

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,920
that are being presented that they are seeking to pass into law here in Virginia. It can make you go

67
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:07,040
crazy. I'm serious. We are living in a wicked society. Some of the bills that they are introducing

68
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,079
and I do not desire this evening to go into great detail but you can go and look for them yourself

69
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,160
if you say I have no idea what you're talking about my head's been in the sand I'd be glad to

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,559
share some things with you but the reality is that we're living in a time in which as Isaiah said

71
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:30,239
they call evil good and good evil that they decree unrighteous decrees yes they are legislating

72
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:38,959
wickedness and as we begin to think about the the wickedness and as God took my attention to

73
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,320
this passage in Leviticus 18 I hope that it'd be a help to you and that it would be a help to

74
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,720
to even me and my family as we would try to navigate this world in this society in which

75
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,200
we're living notice what the Bible says in Leviticus 18 I'm just going to focus upon the

76
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,880
first five verses of this chapter this evening I would encourage you however to take as a quote

77
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,359
unquote homework assignment and read chapters 18 19 and 20 of the book of Leviticus and see

78
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:17,600
the detail by which God would give his people with regard uh to the to the importance of the

79
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,640
subject that is before us and how he would deal with very specific things notice in verse number

80
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:32,080
one of Leviticus 18 the Bible says this and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the

81
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:41,200
children of Israel and say unto them I am the Lord your God if you're taking notes this evening

82
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,080
that's what I've titled the message for tonight I am the Lord your God it was we just kind of

83
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,760
focus upon that statement for just a moment uh we see the authority that our God has we

84
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,320
understand the position uh that he holds and we would think of his position as authority and we

85
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,719
find that he God is saying to Moses speak unto the children of Israel but when you go to speak

86
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:14,320
to the children of Israel don't tell them this is what Moses is saying this is God speaking this is

87
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,359
God's message to God's people and he says I am the Lord your God we understand the covenant

88
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:27,760
relationship between uh the Lord God Jehovah in Israel and we understand uh here in the Old

89
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Testament contextually all that's taking place and how God is preparing his people for the entrance

90
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,239
into the land of promise but I'd understand this evening as New Testament believers what a joy it

91
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:47,280
is to know that he is my God he is it is a personal relationship that we have with the God of the

92
00:09:47,280 --> 00:10:00,080
universe and and he is our God he has a position of authority he is Lord and Master amen the reality

93
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,260
is that He, with that authority and with that position, is going to give some

94
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,500
instruction to the children of Israel that was of significant value for them

95
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,460
with regard to the circumstances in which they were dealing with. And we

96
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,180
understand this evening that if we can look at this passage of Scripture from

97
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,260
many thousands of years ago and understand that it's still relevant for

98
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,780
us today, and that we'd understand that our God is speaking from a position of

99
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:37,500
authority, that He has some valuable instruction for us. Notice what the Bible

100
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,020
says in verse number three. If you're taking notes, I would simply say that you

101
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,660
should note what is forbidden. Note what is forbidden. Notice what God says,

102
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:59,780
After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do. Now

103
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,300
you understand, we'll look at the rest of the passage here in just a moment, but

104
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,700
you understand that God is speaking to these people, His people, and He is

105
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,180
reminding them of those things that they observed when they were in Egypt. Now, we

106
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,180
understand some things about Egypt as we look scripturally and understand that

107
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,220
as God would call Moses to go stand before Pharaoh and all that had taken

108
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,060
place during the plagues and so on and so forth, that the Egyptians were a

109
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:37,340
polytheistic people. They served a plurality of gods. We find that there

110
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,780
were certain things with regard to their religion and certain things with regard

111
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,740
to their practice that God is speaking of and He says to His people, I've

112
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,780
brought you out of Egypt, but I want you to understand and I want you to be

113
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,140
mindful that those things which you observed, the doings of the land of Egypt

114
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:11,100
wherein ye dwelt, notice these four words, shall ye not do. He goes on, And after the

115
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:19,700
doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you shall ye not do, neither shall

116
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,540
ye walk in their ordinances. As you understand here that the children of

117
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,620
Israel are kind of in a position in which they've left Egypt and they're not

118
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,680
quite to the land of Canaan yet, they're in this in-between time, and we

119
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,260
understand that the children of Israel, as you look at the scriptures and you

120
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,700
understand that they will not, of course, as you look through the

121
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,260
book of Numbers, they will not believe God, they will not go over, there's this

122
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,060
period of wilderness wandering, so on and so forth, and God, however, here in the

123
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,820
book of Leviticus, as He's preparing them, they've exited from Egypt, He's trying to

124
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,380
prepare them for dwelling in Canaan. And He says there's some things that you

125
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,140
observed in Egypt, you're not supposed to do those things, there's some things

126
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,980
that you're going to observe in Canaan, you're not supposed to do those things.

127
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,300
You'll note that on two occasions in verse number three, that the Bible says

128
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,140
shall ye not do. It's pretty clear, is it not? And so we understand that as we would

129
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,180
take note of verse number three, that there are some things that are forbidden

130
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,980
and we would note that as we go throughout the next couple of chapters

131
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:40,420
in particular, that God will very explicitly go through details of things

132
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,940
that they shall not do. Not only does He tell them what they shall not do, but He

133
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,980
shares with them what the consequences of such actions would bring. We find that

134
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:57,380
God is gracious and merciful in giving this instruction to the children of

135
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,420
Israel and helping them to understand the significance. Listen, the reality is

136
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,100
that we live in a time and a place in which it is very easy to be influenced

137
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,540
by those things that we see, by the things that people are doing. And if

138
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,540
we're not careful, we'll see that generationally the influence of the

139
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:25,380
world upon the people of God seems to increase. Holly has often said, she was

140
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,580
told this as a young child as she was in church, and I've often repeated it, that

141
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,860
what one generation does in moderation, the next does in excess. And I believe

142
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,100
there's a lot of truth in that. And we find that if you would hold your place

143
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
here and go to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will, and we know that there's a

144
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,980
period of time that has now elapsed and we understand some things that have

145
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,460
happened in the nation of Israel's history and what-have-you, Deuteronomy

146
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,300
chapter number six, and I want you to look at some things here. In Deuteronomy

147
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,260
chapter number six, it's really repeated what we've just looked at in

148
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,060
Leviticus 18, it says in verse number 20 of Deuteronomy 6,

149
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,540
"...and when thy son asked at thee in time to come, saying, What mean the

150
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,540
testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath

151
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,040
commanded you? Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in

152
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,180
Egypt. The Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and the Lord showed

153
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,460
signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his

154
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,300
household before our eyes. And he brought us out from thence, that he might

155
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,180
bring us in, to give us a land which he swore unto our fathers." And notice what

156
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,020
it says, "...and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our

157
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,900
God for our good always, that he might preserve us alive as it is this day. And

158
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,820
it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments

159
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,420
before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us." Look over in chapter number

160
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,220
10, and I want you to note in verses 12 and 13, the Bible says this in Deuteronomy

161
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,180
10, verse 12, "...and now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to

162
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,540
fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the

163
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,020
Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of the

164
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,900
Lord and his statutes which I command thee this day?" Notice this, it says, "...for thy

165
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,100
good." Now, as we look at the passage back in Leviticus, we see that God says, look,

166
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,900
there's some things that you shall not do. And then he gets in verses 4 and 5

167
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,580
to some things that they shall do. And it's interesting that as God would

168
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,060
remind the people of God, and in Deuteronomy chapter number 6 in

169
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,820
particular, it says that the Lord brought us out that he might bring us in. But God

170
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,300
was preparing them even in the book of Leviticus that, listen, you're gonna

171
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,780
observe some things when you get into the land, and you need to be careful, you

172
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,020
shall not do. Shall ye not do, neither shall you walk in their ordinances. And

173
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:05,300
so we understand that as a child of God, listen, it doesn't matter what society

174
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:13,700
might call right. Amen? Society is not the standard, would you agree? What is the

175
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:22,500
standard? It's gotta be the Word of God. Amen? Society changes, does it not? They

176
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,420
change, they drift. I'll use a simple illustration. This year, in the beginning

177
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,260
of this new session of Congress, they made decisions that you could not use

178
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:41,340
gender-specific pronouns, right? Did you see that in the news? You can't say mother,

179
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,540
father, you can't say founding fathers anymore. That's what they said. But after the

180
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,700
inauguration, the same people are saying the first woman ever to be voted as

181
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,100
vice president. I thought we weren't allowed to use that word. Do you

182
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,180
understand the hypocrisy? Their standard is not our standard, you understand? The

183
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,540
standard is the Word of God. And as we begin to look at things that are

184
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,900
happening in Virginia, that's at a national level, but it's happening in

185
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,620
Virginia. I mean, some of the bills that are taking place right now, and what's

186
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,100
the problem is that these things are, our young people are being heavily influenced

187
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,900
by these things. And if we're not careful, we need to understand, listen, there's

188
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,020
some things that we're gonna observe in the world, but we have to understand what

189
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,420
God says. He says, you shall not do these things. Notice in verse 4 and 5, note what

190
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,860
is commanded. In verse 5, he says this, ye shall do my judgments and keep mine

191
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:56,739
ordinances to walk therein. I am the Lord your God. Remember, it says in verse

192
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:02,380
number 2, I am the Lord your God. Aren't you thankful for that reminder, not only

193
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,220
in verse number 2, as God begins to speak to the children of Israel, but then

194
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,299
as he tells them what they shall do, he reminds them of his position and his

195
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:17,900
authority. He's our God, the Lord our God. It says in verse number 5, ye shall

196
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,540
therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall

197
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:32,340
live in them. I am the Lord. He's God. By the way, he's the creator of all things,

198
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,860
is he not? So as the creator of all things, as the Lord God omnipotent with

199
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,179
having all power, all wisdom, the position that he has, does he not have

200
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:53,500
the right to establish morals? He's the authority. Amen? And so when we look, and

201
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,059
again, as a homework type of an assignment, as you read through the

202
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,980
remainder of chapters 18, 19, and 20, it's very...

203
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,180
It's interesting how that several of the things

204
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,860
that we still are facing today

205
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
by way of evil and wickedness

206
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,040
are things that are explicitly dealt with

207
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,260
in these three chapters in the book of Leviticus.

208
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,880
And as we begin to understand

209
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,040
that there are some things that are forbidden,

210
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,200
but there are some things that are commanded,

211
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
and we find that He says,

212
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,940
ye shall do, notice He says,

213
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,240
My judgments.

214
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,260
Notice He says,

215
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,460
and keep Mine ordinances

216
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,660
to walk therein.

217
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,580
Notice v. 5.

218
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,820
Ye shall therefore keep My statutes

219
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,300
and My judgments.

220
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,460
This is God's Word.

221
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,820
It's God's way.

222
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,900
It's very interesting.

223
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,320
I believe that most that would identify

224
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,860
as being Bible-believing Christians

225
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,100
would agree with the statement

226
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,420
that there's only one way to Heaven.

227
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,700
Jesus is the only way.

228
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,980
Why is that?

229
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Well, because that's what God established.

230
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,540
Black and white.

231
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,660
There's no other name under Heaven

232
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,540
given among men whereby we must be saved.

233
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,140
Jesus Christ Himself said,

234
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,820
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

235
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,860
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

236
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,020
But then all of a sudden,

237
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,180
we deal with some of what God's judgments

238
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,580
and ordinances and statutes are,

239
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,380
and these are God's ways,

240
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,940
and God with that same level of authority

241
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,420
has established here's right, here's wrong.

242
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,860
It seems to sometimes become

243
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,660
a gray area of discussion

244
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,420
that really should just be what did God say?

245
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,820
And what I would submit to myself

246
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,900
and to my family and to you

247
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,660
as our church family is that

248
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,380
in order for us to do these things,

249
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,980
in order for us to keep the ordinances of God,

250
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,900
in order for us to walk therein,

251
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,940
we better know what God's Word says.

252
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,660
It is very unlikely

253
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,020
that we're going to keep the ordinances of God,

254
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,540
that we're going to obey His judgments

255
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,500
and His statutes if we don't know what they are, right?

256
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,580
It's very unlikely.

257
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,300
And so what does that mean?

258
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
It means we better dig in

259
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
and we better understand what the Word of God says,

260
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,380
and we better be able to defend our position

261
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,740
and the truth by which we stand.

262
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,060
We understand, it's interesting,

263
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,380
you don't need to turn there,

264
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,180
but in Deuteronomy chapter number 17,

265
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,700
God gave instruction that when there were kings,

266
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,860
that the kings were supposed to write out

267
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,060
the law of the Lord.

268
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,180
And it's interesting for He says

269
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,340
that they shall write Him a copy of this law in a book

270
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,660
out of that which is before the priests, the Levites,

271
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,740
and it shall be with Him,

272
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,300
and He shall read therein all the days of His life.

273
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,140
Why?

274
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,980
That He may learn to fear the Lord His God

275
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,340
and to keep all the words of this law

276
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,540
and these statutes to do them.

277
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,900
Sometimes we have a hard time just reading the Bible,

278
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,980
yet alone copying it out.

279
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,100
But you think about the significance of that.

280
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,580
If the kings, listen, if some of the kings of Israel

281
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,140
would have followed the instruction in Deuteronomy 17,

282
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,060
perhaps it would have kept them from some evil.

283
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,020
Why?

284
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
They would have been much more mindful

285
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,260
of what the statutes and judgments

286
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,020
and commandments of God are.

287
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,260
And for us this evening,

288
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,900
we've looked at the two passages,

289
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,380
one in Deuteronomy 6 and one in Deuteronomy chapter number 10

290
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,780
and in both of those passages of Scripture,

291
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,460
we see that phraseology for thy good.

292
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
You understand that obeying God,

293
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,980
it's in our best interest.

294
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,700
It is advantageous for us to obey the Word of God.

295
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,820
God says here in Leviticus 18,

296
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,300
the passage in which we've used as our study this evening,

297
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,420
in verse number five, He says this,

298
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,220
"'Which if a man do, he shall live in them.

299
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,780
"'I am the Lord.'"

300
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,820
We need the delight in the commandments of the Lord.

301
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,740
We understand Psalm 119 is a precious psalm

302
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,740
and it's filled with just very personal aspects

303
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,740
from the psalmist and how much he loves the law of the Lord

304
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,820
and how he meditates upon the precepts of the Word of God

305
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,900
and how he purposes to keep and obey the commandments

306
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,420
and judgments and statutes of God's Word.

307
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,420
And this evening, we understand that we're living in a time

308
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,420
in which, as Isaiah said,

309
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,380
evil is good and good is evil.

310
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,180
But we're not the first generation.

311
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,500
We're not the first people to ever experience that.

312
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,980
But I would say to you this evening

313
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,340
that we better know what the Word of God says.

314
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,060
We better know what the Word of God says.

315
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Why is it that we do not support this position

316
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,980
or that position or why is it that we can talk

317
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,500
to our children when perhaps your children would come home,

318
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,260
not anymore, they're doing school from home,

319
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,820
but after they're done class and they've been influenced

320
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,740
by some teaching, by some idea,

321
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,220
how is it that we can take the Word of God

322
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,180
and properly instruct them to know

323
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,820
here's what God's Word says about that subject?

324
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,460
I understand what the society is saying.

325
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,900
I understand what they're saying that we can and cannot do.

326
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,220
And I understand the way in which they're seeking

327
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,620
to silence truth.

328
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,220
Here's something that's interesting.

329
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,420
I've heard people in recent days say something,

330
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,140
well, that's my truth.

331
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,900
Do you know that there's not my truth and your truth?

332
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,900
There really isn't, there's just truth.

333
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,340
And what is truth?

334
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,860
Well, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life,

335
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,540
right, thy Word is truth.

336
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,100
John 17.

337
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,660
And so it's not that truth is some different body of truth

338
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,340
depending on where you are or what society you're in.

339
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,700
No, this is truth.

340
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,900
We better know it.

341
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,140
Because we're living, as Paul said to the believers

342
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,820
in Philippi, in a crooked and perverse generation.

343
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,780
We really are.

344
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,340
And if you've not taken note recently

345
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,180
of some of the ideas that are being floated,

346
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,380
that are bills that are being introduced for legislation,

347
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,060
it's sad.

348
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,340
It is a sad day in which we're living.

349
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,380
It is a day in which they have forsaken

350
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,860
the truth of the Word of God.

351
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,700
But we as the people of God,

352
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,820
though we might have to live through those times,

353
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,380
we understand that we cannot be influenced by those things.

354
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,620
We have to understand that the children of Israel,

355
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
they were in Egypt for a period of time.

356
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,940
And they were going to go into Canaan,

357
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,220
and they were gonna see some things.

358
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,980
And God says, you shall not do.

359
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,420
Don't learn to do after their doings.

360
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,860
Shall ye not do neither?

361
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,500
Notice how you walk in their ordinances.

362
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,140
You notice how he talks about their ordinances

363
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,660
in verse number three of Leviticus 18,

364
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,980
but then talks about mine ordinances

365
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,900
in Leviticus 18, verse number four.

366
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,980
Theirs, mine.

367
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,540
We wanna know what God says.

368
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,500
And I would submit to you this evening

369
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,660
that the Word of God speaks to the issues of the day.

370
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,620
God's Word is relevant for every generation.

371
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,140
Why is that so?

372
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,620
Because God is eternal.

373
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,860
He has no beginning and no end.

374
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,460
He's eternal, and he's written the Word of God,

375
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,020
and he's given it to us that it would,

376
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,180
he talks about it being preserved for all generations,

377
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,940
and we understand that his Word is relevant.

378
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,820
And so if there's some issue that we're dealing with

379
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,860
in the day in which we're living here in 2021,

380
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,660
if there's some social issue that's being discussed,

381
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,100
and some moral whatever that is being,

382
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,620
a bill that's being introduced,

383
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,660
if we dig into the Word of God,

384
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,380
we can find out what God thinks about those subject matters.

385
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,020
It's gonna require some work.

386
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,020
It's gonna require us to dig in,

387
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,700
but I wanna be on the right side of the thing.

388
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,060
I wanna be on understanding what the Word of God says.

389
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,420
And we don't have to be ugly about it.

390
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,460
We don't have to be combative about it,

391
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,660
but we can stand and we can stand firm

392
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,020
on here's what God said, period.

393
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,740
This is truth.

394
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,100
Now, the reality is it might cost us something,

395
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,660
but I'd be, listen, I would much rather

396
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
pay a price temporally than disappoint my God, honestly.

397
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,340
Honestly.

398
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,820
And He's given us a body of truth, the Word of God.

399
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,380
And I just hope tonight that we would determine

400
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,540
that not only for us, but for our children,

401
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,980
that we'd understand the things

402
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,620
that they're being exposed to,

403
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,900
and the wickedness and the evil ideas

404
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,620
that are being propagated,

405
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,020
and that we'd be able to teach them truth

406
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,140
from the Word of God.

407
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,540
This isn't just mom's way or dad's way.

408
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,820
This is God's way.

409
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,620
And by the way, when our children understand

410
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,580
that this is God's way, not just mom or dad's way,

411
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,140
it's gonna have a much greater impact in their lives.

412
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,980
Why?

413
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,580
Because we're able to say, listen, yes, we do this

414
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,180
because we believe that this is what God says to do,

415
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,700
and it's best for us.

416
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,900
It is good for us.

417
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,340
And so let me show you so that you can understand

418
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
what God expects of you and what God wants you to do.

419
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,740
do, because it's best for you. You notice again, and I'll close with this, you don't

420
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,420
need to turn there, but in Exodus 6 and verse 24, right in the middle of the verse, it says,

421
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:18,500
for our good always. What is it referring to? The fact that we would do the statutes

422
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,900
of the Lord and that we would fear Him. It's for our good always. It is always best for

423
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:34,420
us to obey God. This evening as we think about this passage and we think about the world

424
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:41,500
in which we're living, honestly, my heart is broken. And the reality is that I do not

425
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,060
in any way, shape, or form believe that the answer for any of the problems that we're

426
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:57,220
dealing with is going to be delivered through some legislation. The answers are not going

427
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,580
to be found in a state house. They're not going to be found in a courthouse. You know

428
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,140
where the answers are going to be found? You know where the victory is going to be won?

429
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,560
In your prayer closet. Honestly. Honestly, that we just get a hold of God and just pray

430
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,400
that God would do a work and then allow ourselves to be in a position that God would use us,

431
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,640
that He would soften the hearts of people and give us opportunity to proclaim the gospel

432
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:34,700
of Christ because Jesus is the answer. I was wearing my mask the other day when I came

433
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,460
out of an establishment and it was the mask that says, Jesus loves you. People are much

434
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,980
more favorable to that mask than the one that says, Jesus saves. And most people like

435
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:56,260
the idea that Jesus loves them. More people appreciate that than the Jesus saves. It's

436
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:02,620
a little bit more direct, if you will. And I had the Jesus loves you mask on and a man

437
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,580
stopped me and he said, can I talk to you for a minute? And I was kind of startled because

438
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,380
he came around his vehicle. I didn't see him at first. And he said, I saw your mask when you're

439
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,940
walking by and I just want to thank you for wearing that mask. And he got into a, you know,

440
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,380
dialogue of whatever and kind of really got off point of what I was seeking to communicate by

441
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,740
using or wearing that mask. And I said, listen, sir, I said, the reality is I believe with all

442
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:36,180
my heart that the answer for this world is Jesus. That's the answer. And we have to be careful not

443
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:45,940
to be influenced by our society, but to be influencing our society. See the church in Corinth

444
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,540
is a church that we often look to as being a troubled church that we can learn a lot from.

445
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:59,260
Certainly not a model church. Amen. I told you before, I saw a guy down in Tennessee that had

446
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,220
a church and he was passing a church and it was called First Corinthian Baptist Church. And I

447
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,860
thought who in the world would ever name their church First Corinthian Baptist Church? Evidently,

448
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,540
they never read the book of First Corinthians. I don't know. But the reality is that there's much

449
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,900
that we can learn from that book. Much that we can learn. And one thing that we learn from that

450
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:26,820
book is that God has intended it to be so that the church would influence and impact the society.

451
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:34,500
Yet that was a church that was being impacted by the society. That's not how God designed it.

452
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,580
And we need to be careful that we would be lights in this dark world. Remember, Paul said that they

453
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:46,620
were living in a crooked and perverse world, but in whom you shine as lights. I'm so thankful for

454
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:53,900
the privilege of being able to represent the Lord Jesus Christ. And this hour is our hour.

455
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:01,460
God could have let us be born in any time of human history. He's allowed us to be alive right now. So

456
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,900
guess what? It's our turn. Amen? To stand for truth. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank

457
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:16,980
you for loving us. Lord, I pray that you'd help us to be mindful of the fact that we are indeed

458
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:27,060
living in a wicked society, but that does not cause us to lose hope. We must be mindful of the

459
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,140
fact that we'll be influenced by some of this wickedness, but we must resist it. And we must

460
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:41,860
determine that in these manners, in these ways, we shall not go. We shall not do. God, help us to

461
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:50,220
know your word, to understand what you've commanded us to do. Help us to be students of the

462
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:58,500
word of God, that we would dig in and that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

463
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:10,340
Father, many within the congregation this evening have children. God, I pray that you would help us

464
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:18,660
to biblically influence our children. We understand the enemy is seeking to destroy and

465
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:25,740
devour. We understand the society is seeking to influence greatly and to capture the minds and

466
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:32,980
hearts of our young people. God, I pray that you'd help us to be studious so that we could be able

467
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:40,820
to impart the truth of your word to our children. Help them to understand that though we live in a

468
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,180
society in which they may call evil good and good evil, a society in which they may decree

469
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:57,780
unrighteous decrees, they may legislate wickedness, that your way is our way because you are our God.

470
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,460
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer. We thank you for the privilege of prayer. We thank

471
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,740
you for answered prayer. We just ask that you'd bless the remainder of our time. For it's in

472
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,260
Christ's name we pray, amen. Does anyone need a prayer bulletin that did not get one this evening?

473
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,820
Anyone need one? All right, let's...
