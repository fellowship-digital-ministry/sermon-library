WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
and the book of Leviticus is a rich book. I love the book of Leviticus and I think oftentimes if

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.880
we're not careful we can breeze through the book and think that really there's not a whole lot for

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.680
us and folks get excited with certain books of the Bible and then get bogged down with other

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.799
books of the Bible but all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable. I was

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:25.920
sharing with someone just in recent days how that many of the chapters of the book of Leviticus in

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.799
particular dealing with a number of the offerings and that sort of thing and how precious it is to

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:37.840
see how the Lord Jesus Christ completed in his single act of redemption fulfilled all aspects

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.159
of the various offerings and what a tremendous blessing that is. As we look at this passage I'm

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.759
going to share a few things with you by way of introduction and then we'll get into the verses

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.360
of scripture I trust to be a blessing to you. The reality is that each day I believe that I am more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.560
and more convinced that we're living in the last days. Paul talked about the last days in particular

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.400
in second Timothy chapter number three and the truth of James in chapter number five the coming

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.680
of the Lord draweth nigh and I believe that and I believe that we are living in a time in which

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.839
we ought to be excited about the opportunities that are presenting themselves to us and it's

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:24.559
interesting when the prophet Isaiah was describing the society in which he was living and the times

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:31.760
in which he was called of God to minister he noted that they call evil good and good evil.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.680
You can read of that in Isaiah chapter number five a few chapters later in Isaiah chapter number 10

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.279
you will find that he makes this statement. He says that they decree unrighteous decrees. We've

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.839
often looked at that passage of scripture in Isaiah 10. We've talked about the way in which

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:57.360
they would legislate wickedness. They decree unrighteous decrees. The scriptures tell us that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.639
our righteous God loveth righteousness. I'm thankful that our God is righteous. He's not becoming

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:10.960
righteous. He is righteous and he loveth righteousness and we read that in Psalm 11 in

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.000
verse number seven. If you look in Proverbs in chapter number 14 in verse 34 the Bible says that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.440
righteousness exalteth a nation. This is this sin is a reproach to any people. Paul extended a call

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.679
to the believers in Corinth and said to those believers come out from among them and be separate.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.199
We find that Jesus in his priestly prayer in John chapter number 17 he makes the statement that we

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.839
are of the world but we're not in or excuse me we're in the world but we're not of the world

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:49.679
and what a blessing to understand that this world is not my home that I am just a passing through

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:55.039
that we are strangers in pilgrims that we are ambassadors. We find that the believers in

00:02:55.039 --> 00:03:00.880
Philippi they were encouraged by the apostle Paul in Philippians 2 in verse 15 when he told them that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.479
they were dwelling or living in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation but then he said this

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:14.479
among whom you shine as lights in the world. Peter would remind his readers of the importance

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:21.360
of being holy in all manner of conversation. You can read of that in first Peter 1 verses 14 through 16.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.559
When you read those verses of scripture you'll find that in verse number 16 the Bible says be

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:32.800
holy or as it is written be holy for I am holy. We know that this book of Leviticus that I've had

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.800
you turn to this evening that it's here in the book of Leviticus that God will deal with the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.279
importance of holy living and the importance of living in a manner that would please our God and

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:50.639
our Savior. As I consider the few sampling of scriptures that I've shared with you this evening

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:57.279
by way of introduction I'm reminded this evening that we are not the first generation to live in

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:03.679
a wicked society and sometimes we can kind of get that idea that it's never been as bad as it is

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:11.279
today. God destroyed the world in Genesis because of the wickedness of the people, right? Noah's flood

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:18.160
and we understand that there were eight that were saved upon the ark but the wickedness of mankind

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.559
had reached a high point. We find that throughout the scriptures you can read of great wickedness

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.959
that takes place in a number of different cultures and societies and as you would consider with me

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:36.559
the the fact that yes we're living in the last days and yes when Paul would describe the last

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:41.440
days in second Timothy chapter number three he said that perilous times shall come he said that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.600
evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived. It seems as if at

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.440
times in our lives we are thinking somehow that things are going to get better that there's going

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.239
to be some utopian type of view and everything's just going to be wonderful. God says in his word

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:07.920
that evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse but continue that's our responsibility

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.799
that's our charge. The reality is that as we look at the truth of the word of God and we understand

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:22.160
that we are not the first generation to live in a wicked society that I'm reminded that God has

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.600
given specific instruction to his people all throughout the history in various times and in

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.880
various places and of course we now have the whole canon of scripture that we can go to and be

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.600
encouraged by but in that specific instruction God provides us with truth that would enable us to live

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:51.040
godly in a wicked society. I don't know if you follow some of the social issues that are taking

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.320
place in our world today and I do not desire in any way shape or form to address the subject

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.359
matters in specific detail this evening or to deal with anything in a political type of a manner.

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:12.399
The reality is that it does not really matter how someone is described with a political party how

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:19.760
they align so on and so forth what matters is what they stand for. As we begin to I'm receiving

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.239
emails on a daily basis you understand that right now here in the Commonwealth of Virginia our state

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:31.119
legislation legislators are meeting down in Richmond they've they're actually kind of doing

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.799
some cyber meetings and what have you because of COVID but it's general session general assembly

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:43.040
time in the Commonwealth of Virginia and I'm getting regular updates sometimes multiple times

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.160
a day I am getting updates with regards to some of the laws bills I should say some of the bills

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.920
that are being presented that they are seeking to pass into law here in Virginia. It can make you go

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:07.040
crazy. I'm serious. We are living in a wicked society. Some of the bills that they are introducing

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.079
and I do not desire this evening to go into great detail but you can go and look for them yourself

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.160
if you say I have no idea what you're talking about my head's been in the sand I'd be glad to

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.559
share some things with you but the reality is that we're living in a time in which as Isaiah said

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:30.239
they call evil good and good evil that they decree unrighteous decrees yes they are legislating

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:38.959
wickedness and as we begin to think about the the wickedness and as God took my attention to

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:44.320
this passage in Leviticus 18 I hope that it'd be a help to you and that it would be a help to

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.720
to even me and my family as we would try to navigate this world in this society in which

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.200
we're living notice what the Bible says in Leviticus 18 I'm just going to focus upon the

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:04.880
first five verses of this chapter this evening I would encourage you however to take as a quote

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.359
unquote homework assignment and read chapters 18 19 and 20 of the book of Leviticus and see

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:17.600
the detail by which God would give his people with regard uh to the to the importance of the

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.640
subject that is before us and how he would deal with very specific things notice in verse number

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:32.080
one of Leviticus 18 the Bible says this and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:41.200
children of Israel and say unto them I am the Lord your God if you're taking notes this evening

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.080
that's what I've titled the message for tonight I am the Lord your God it was we just kind of

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.760
focus upon that statement for just a moment uh we see the authority that our God has we

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.320
understand the position uh that he holds and we would think of his position as authority and we

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.719
find that he God is saying to Moses speak unto the children of Israel but when you go to speak

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:14.320
to the children of Israel don't tell them this is what Moses is saying this is God speaking this is

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.359
God's message to God's people and he says I am the Lord your God we understand the covenant

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:27.760
relationship between uh the Lord God Jehovah in Israel and we understand uh here in the Old

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.760
Testament contextually all that's taking place and how God is preparing his people for the entrance

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.239
into the land of promise but I'd understand this evening as New Testament believers what a joy it

00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:47.280
is to know that he is my God he is it is a personal relationship that we have with the God of the

00:09:47.280 --> 00:10:00.080
universe and and he is our God he has a position of authority he is Lord and Master amen the reality

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.260
is that He, with that authority and with that position, is going to give some

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.500
instruction to the children of Israel that was of significant value for them

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.460
with regard to the circumstances in which they were dealing with. And we

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.180
understand this evening that if we can look at this passage of Scripture from

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.260
many thousands of years ago and understand that it's still relevant for

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.780
us today, and that we'd understand that our God is speaking from a position of

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:37.500
authority, that He has some valuable instruction for us. Notice what the Bible

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.020
says in verse number three. If you're taking notes, I would simply say that you

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:48.660
should note what is forbidden. Note what is forbidden. Notice what God says,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:59.780
After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do. Now

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.300
you understand, we'll look at the rest of the passage here in just a moment, but

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.700
you understand that God is speaking to these people, His people, and He is

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.180
reminding them of those things that they observed when they were in Egypt. Now, we

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.180
understand some things about Egypt as we look scripturally and understand that

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.220
as God would call Moses to go stand before Pharaoh and all that had taken

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.060
place during the plagues and so on and so forth, that the Egyptians were a

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:37.340
polytheistic people. They served a plurality of gods. We find that there

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.780
were certain things with regard to their religion and certain things with regard

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.740
to their practice that God is speaking of and He says to His people, I've

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.780
brought you out of Egypt, but I want you to understand and I want you to be

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:58.140
mindful that those things which you observed, the doings of the land of Egypt

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:11.100
wherein ye dwelt, notice these four words, shall ye not do. He goes on, And after the

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:19.700
doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you shall ye not do, neither shall

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.540
ye walk in their ordinances. As you understand here that the children of

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.620
Israel are kind of in a position in which they've left Egypt and they're not

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.680
quite to the land of Canaan yet, they're in this in-between time, and we

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.260
understand that the children of Israel, as you look at the scriptures and you

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.700
understand that they will not, of course, as you look through the

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.260
book of Numbers, they will not believe God, they will not go over, there's this

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.060
period of wilderness wandering, so on and so forth, and God, however, here in the

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.820
book of Leviticus, as He's preparing them, they've exited from Egypt, He's trying to

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.380
prepare them for dwelling in Canaan. And He says there's some things that you

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.140
observed in Egypt, you're not supposed to do those things, there's some things

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.980
that you're going to observe in Canaan, you're not supposed to do those things.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.300
You'll note that on two occasions in verse number three, that the Bible says

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:26.140
shall ye not do. It's pretty clear, is it not? And so we understand that as we would

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.180
take note of verse number three, that there are some things that are forbidden

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.980
and we would note that as we go throughout the next couple of chapters

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.420
in particular, that God will very explicitly go through details of things

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.940
that they shall not do. Not only does He tell them what they shall not do, but He

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.980
shares with them what the consequences of such actions would bring. We find that

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.380
God is gracious and merciful in giving this instruction to the children of

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.420
Israel and helping them to understand the significance. Listen, the reality is

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:08.100
that we live in a time and a place in which it is very easy to be influenced

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.540
by those things that we see, by the things that people are doing. And if

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.540
we're not careful, we'll see that generationally the influence of the

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:25.380
world upon the people of God seems to increase. Holly has often said, she was

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.580
told this as a young child as she was in church, and I've often repeated it, that

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.860
what one generation does in moderation, the next does in excess. And I believe

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.100
there's a lot of truth in that. And we find that if you would hold your place

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.100
here and go to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will, and we know that there's a

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.980
period of time that has now elapsed and we understand some things that have

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.460
happened in the nation of Israel's history and what-have-you, Deuteronomy

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.300
chapter number six, and I want you to look at some things here. In Deuteronomy

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.260
chapter number six, it's really repeated what we've just looked at in

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.060
Leviticus 18, it says in verse number 20 of Deuteronomy 6,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.540
"...and when thy son asked at thee in time to come, saying, What mean the

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.540
testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.040
commanded you? Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.180
Egypt. The Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and the Lord showed

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.460
signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.300
household before our eyes. And he brought us out from thence, that he might

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.180
bring us in, to give us a land which he swore unto our fathers." And notice what

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.020
it says, "...and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:47.900
God for our good always, that he might preserve us alive as it is this day. And

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.820
it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.420
before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us." Look over in chapter number

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:02.220
10, and I want you to note in verses 12 and 13, the Bible says this in Deuteronomy

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.180
10, verse 12, "...and now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.540
fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.020
Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of the

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.900
Lord and his statutes which I command thee this day?" Notice this, it says, "...for thy

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:26.100
good." Now, as we look at the passage back in Leviticus, we see that God says, look,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.900
there's some things that you shall not do. And then he gets in verses 4 and 5

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.580
to some things that they shall do. And it's interesting that as God would

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.060
remind the people of God, and in Deuteronomy chapter number 6 in

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.820
particular, it says that the Lord brought us out that he might bring us in. But God

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.300
was preparing them even in the book of Leviticus that, listen, you're gonna

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.780
observe some things when you get into the land, and you need to be careful, you

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.020
shall not do. Shall ye not do, neither shall you walk in their ordinances. And

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.300
so we understand that as a child of God, listen, it doesn't matter what society

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:13.700
might call right. Amen? Society is not the standard, would you agree? What is the

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:22.500
standard? It's gotta be the Word of God. Amen? Society changes, does it not? They

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:30.420
change, they drift. I'll use a simple illustration. This year, in the beginning

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:35.260
of this new session of Congress, they made decisions that you could not use

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:41.340
gender-specific pronouns, right? Did you see that in the news? You can't say mother,

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.540
father, you can't say founding fathers anymore. That's what they said. But after the

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.700
inauguration, the same people are saying the first woman ever to be voted as

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.100
vice president. I thought we weren't allowed to use that word. Do you

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.180
understand the hypocrisy? Their standard is not our standard, you understand? The

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.540
standard is the Word of God. And as we begin to look at things that are

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.900
happening in Virginia, that's at a national level, but it's happening in

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.620
Virginia. I mean, some of the bills that are taking place right now, and what's

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:25.100
the problem is that these things are, our young people are being heavily influenced

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.900
by these things. And if we're not careful, we need to understand, listen, there's

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:36.020
some things that we're gonna observe in the world, but we have to understand what

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:42.420
God says. He says, you shall not do these things. Notice in verse 4 and 5, note what

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.860
is commanded. In verse 5, he says this, ye shall do my judgments and keep mine

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:56.739
ordinances to walk therein. I am the Lord your God. Remember, it says in verse

00:18:56.739 --> 00:19:02.380
number 2, I am the Lord your God. Aren't you thankful for that reminder, not only

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.220
in verse number 2, as God begins to speak to the children of Israel, but then

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.299
as he tells them what they shall do, he reminds them of his position and his

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:17.900
authority. He's our God, the Lord our God. It says in verse number 5, ye shall

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.540
therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:32.340
live in them. I am the Lord. He's God. By the way, he's the creator of all things,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.860
is he not? So as the creator of all things, as the Lord God omnipotent with

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:44.179
having all power, all wisdom, the position that he has, does he not have

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:53.500
the right to establish morals? He's the authority. Amen? And so when we look, and

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.059
again, as a homework type of an assignment, as you read through the

00:19:57.059 --> 00:20:01.980
remainder of chapters 18, 19, and 20, it's very...

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.180
It's interesting how that several of the things

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.860
that we still are facing today

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.860
by way of evil and wickedness

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.040
are things that are explicitly dealt with

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.260
in these three chapters in the book of Leviticus.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.880
And as we begin to understand

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.040
that there are some things that are forbidden,

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.200
but there are some things that are commanded,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.440
and we find that He says,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.940
ye shall do, notice He says,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.240
My judgments.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.260
Notice He says,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.460
and keep Mine ordinances

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.660
to walk therein.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.580
Notice v. 5.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.820
Ye shall therefore keep My statutes

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.300
and My judgments.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.460
This is God's Word.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.820
It's God's way.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.900
It's very interesting.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.320
I believe that most that would identify

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.860
as being Bible-believing Christians

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.100
would agree with the statement

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.420
that there's only one way to Heaven.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.700
Jesus is the only way.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.980
Why is that?

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
Well, because that's what God established.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.540
Black and white.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.660
There's no other name under Heaven

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.540
given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.140
Jesus Christ Himself said,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.820
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.860
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.020
But then all of a sudden,

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.180
we deal with some of what God's judgments

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.580
and ordinances and statutes are,

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.380
and these are God's ways,

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.940
and God with that same level of authority

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.420
has established here's right, here's wrong.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.860
It seems to sometimes become

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.660
a gray area of discussion

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.420
that really should just be what did God say?

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.820
And what I would submit to myself

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.900
and to my family and to you

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.660
as our church family is that

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.380
in order for us to do these things,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.980
in order for us to keep the ordinances of God,

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.900
in order for us to walk therein,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.940
we better know what God's Word says.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.660
It is very unlikely

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.020
that we're going to keep the ordinances of God,

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.540
that we're going to obey His judgments

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.500
and His statutes if we don't know what they are, right?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.580
It's very unlikely.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.300
And so what does that mean?

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.300
It means we better dig in

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.500
and we better understand what the Word of God says,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.380
and we better be able to defend our position

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.740
and the truth by which we stand.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.060
We understand, it's interesting,

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.380
you don't need to turn there,

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.180
but in Deuteronomy chapter number 17,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.700
God gave instruction that when there were kings,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.860
that the kings were supposed to write out

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.060
the law of the Lord.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.180
And it's interesting for He says

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.340
that they shall write Him a copy of this law in a book

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.660
out of that which is before the priests, the Levites,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.740
and it shall be with Him,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.300
and He shall read therein all the days of His life.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.140
Why?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.980
That He may learn to fear the Lord His God

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.340
and to keep all the words of this law

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.540
and these statutes to do them.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.900
Sometimes we have a hard time just reading the Bible,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.980
yet alone copying it out.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.100
But you think about the significance of that.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.580
If the kings, listen, if some of the kings of Israel

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.140
would have followed the instruction in Deuteronomy 17,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.060
perhaps it would have kept them from some evil.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.020
Why?

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.860
They would have been much more mindful

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.260
of what the statutes and judgments

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.020
and commandments of God are.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.260
And for us this evening,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.900
we've looked at the two passages,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.380
one in Deuteronomy 6 and one in Deuteronomy chapter number 10

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.780
and in both of those passages of Scripture,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.460
we see that phraseology for thy good.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.460
You understand that obeying God,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.980
it's in our best interest.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.700
It is advantageous for us to obey the Word of God.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.820
God says here in Leviticus 18,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.300
the passage in which we've used as our study this evening,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.420
in verse number five, He says this,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.220
"'Which if a man do, he shall live in them.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.780
"'I am the Lord.'"

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.820
We need the delight in the commandments of the Lord.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.740
We understand Psalm 119 is a precious psalm

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.740
and it's filled with just very personal aspects

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.740
from the psalmist and how much he loves the law of the Lord

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.820
and how he meditates upon the precepts of the Word of God

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.900
and how he purposes to keep and obey the commandments

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.420
and judgments and statutes of God's Word.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.420
And this evening, we understand that we're living in a time

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.420
in which, as Isaiah said,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.380
evil is good and good is evil.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.180
But we're not the first generation.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.500
We're not the first people to ever experience that.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.980
But I would say to you this evening

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.340
that we better know what the Word of God says.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.060
We better know what the Word of God says.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.060
Why is it that we do not support this position

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.980
or that position or why is it that we can talk

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.500
to our children when perhaps your children would come home,

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.260
not anymore, they're doing school from home,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.820
but after they're done class and they've been influenced

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.740
by some teaching, by some idea,

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.220
how is it that we can take the Word of God

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.180
and properly instruct them to know

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.820
here's what God's Word says about that subject?

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.460
I understand what the society is saying.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.900
I understand what they're saying that we can and cannot do.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.220
And I understand the way in which they're seeking

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.620
to silence truth.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.220
Here's something that's interesting.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.420
I've heard people in recent days say something,

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.140
well, that's my truth.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.900
Do you know that there's not my truth and your truth?

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.900
There really isn't, there's just truth.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.340
And what is truth?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.860
Well, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life,

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.540
right, thy Word is truth.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.100
John 17.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.660
And so it's not that truth is some different body of truth

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.340
depending on where you are or what society you're in.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.700
No, this is truth.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.900
We better know it.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.140
Because we're living, as Paul said to the believers

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.820
in Philippi, in a crooked and perverse generation.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.780
We really are.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.340
And if you've not taken note recently

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.180
of some of the ideas that are being floated,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.380
that are bills that are being introduced for legislation,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.060
it's sad.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.340
It is a sad day in which we're living.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.380
It is a day in which they have forsaken

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.860
the truth of the Word of God.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.700
But we as the people of God,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.820
though we might have to live through those times,

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.380
we understand that we cannot be influenced by those things.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.620
We have to understand that the children of Israel,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.620
they were in Egypt for a period of time.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.940
And they were going to go into Canaan,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.220
and they were gonna see some things.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.980
And God says, you shall not do.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.420
Don't learn to do after their doings.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.860
Shall ye not do neither?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.500
Notice how you walk in their ordinances.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.140
You notice how he talks about their ordinances

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.660
in verse number three of Leviticus 18,

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.980
but then talks about mine ordinances

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.900
in Leviticus 18, verse number four.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.980
Theirs, mine.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.540
We wanna know what God says.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.500
And I would submit to you this evening

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.660
that the Word of God speaks to the issues of the day.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.620
God's Word is relevant for every generation.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.140
Why is that so?

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.620
Because God is eternal.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.860
He has no beginning and no end.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.460
He's eternal, and he's written the Word of God,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.020
and he's given it to us that it would,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.180
he talks about it being preserved for all generations,

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.940
and we understand that his Word is relevant.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.820
And so if there's some issue that we're dealing with

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.860
in the day in which we're living here in 2021,

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.660
if there's some social issue that's being discussed,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.100
and some moral whatever that is being,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.620
a bill that's being introduced,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.660
if we dig into the Word of God,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.380
we can find out what God thinks about those subject matters.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.020
It's gonna require some work.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.020
It's gonna require us to dig in,

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.700
but I wanna be on the right side of the thing.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.060
I wanna be on understanding what the Word of God says.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.420
And we don't have to be ugly about it.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.460
We don't have to be combative about it,

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.660
but we can stand and we can stand firm

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.020
on here's what God said, period.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.740
This is truth.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.100
Now, the reality is it might cost us something,

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.660
but I'd be, listen, I would much rather

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.740
pay a price temporally than disappoint my God, honestly.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.340
Honestly.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.820
And He's given us a body of truth, the Word of God.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.380
And I just hope tonight that we would determine

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.540
that not only for us, but for our children,

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.980
that we'd understand the things

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.620
that they're being exposed to,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.900
and the wickedness and the evil ideas

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.620
that are being propagated,

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.020
and that we'd be able to teach them truth

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.140
from the Word of God.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.540
This isn't just mom's way or dad's way.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.820
This is God's way.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.620
And by the way, when our children understand

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.580
that this is God's way, not just mom or dad's way,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.140
it's gonna have a much greater impact in their lives.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:46.980
Why?

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.580
Because we're able to say, listen, yes, we do this

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.180
because we believe that this is what God says to do,

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.700
and it's best for us.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.900
It is good for us.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.340
And so let me show you so that you can understand

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.340
what God expects of you and what God wants you to do.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.740
do, because it's best for you. You notice again, and I'll close with this, you don't

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.420
need to turn there, but in Exodus 6 and verse 24, right in the middle of the verse, it says,

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:18.500
for our good always. What is it referring to? The fact that we would do the statutes

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.900
of the Lord and that we would fear Him. It's for our good always. It is always best for

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:34.420
us to obey God. This evening as we think about this passage and we think about the world

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:41.500
in which we're living, honestly, my heart is broken. And the reality is that I do not

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:47.060
in any way, shape, or form believe that the answer for any of the problems that we're

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:57.220
dealing with is going to be delivered through some legislation. The answers are not going

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.580
to be found in a state house. They're not going to be found in a courthouse. You know

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.140
where the answers are going to be found? You know where the victory is going to be won?

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:14.560
In your prayer closet. Honestly. Honestly, that we just get a hold of God and just pray

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:22.400
that God would do a work and then allow ourselves to be in a position that God would use us,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.640
that He would soften the hearts of people and give us opportunity to proclaim the gospel

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:34.700
of Christ because Jesus is the answer. I was wearing my mask the other day when I came

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:41.460
out of an establishment and it was the mask that says, Jesus loves you. People are much

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.980
more favorable to that mask than the one that says, Jesus saves. And most people like

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:56.260
the idea that Jesus loves them. More people appreciate that than the Jesus saves. It's

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:02.620
a little bit more direct, if you will. And I had the Jesus loves you mask on and a man

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.580
stopped me and he said, can I talk to you for a minute? And I was kind of startled because

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:12.380
he came around his vehicle. I didn't see him at first. And he said, I saw your mask when you're

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.940
walking by and I just want to thank you for wearing that mask. And he got into a, you know,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.380
dialogue of whatever and kind of really got off point of what I was seeking to communicate by

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.740
using or wearing that mask. And I said, listen, sir, I said, the reality is I believe with all

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:36.180
my heart that the answer for this world is Jesus. That's the answer. And we have to be careful not

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:45.940
to be influenced by our society, but to be influencing our society. See the church in Corinth

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.540
is a church that we often look to as being a troubled church that we can learn a lot from.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:59.260
Certainly not a model church. Amen. I told you before, I saw a guy down in Tennessee that had

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.220
a church and he was passing a church and it was called First Corinthian Baptist Church. And I

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:08.860
thought who in the world would ever name their church First Corinthian Baptist Church? Evidently,

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.540
they never read the book of First Corinthians. I don't know. But the reality is that there's much

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:18.900
that we can learn from that book. Much that we can learn. And one thing that we learn from that

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:26.820
book is that God has intended it to be so that the church would influence and impact the society.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:34.500
Yet that was a church that was being impacted by the society. That's not how God designed it.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.580
And we need to be careful that we would be lights in this dark world. Remember, Paul said that they

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:46.620
were living in a crooked and perverse world, but in whom you shine as lights. I'm so thankful for

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:53.900
the privilege of being able to represent the Lord Jesus Christ. And this hour is our hour.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:01.460
God could have let us be born in any time of human history. He's allowed us to be alive right now. So

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:07.900
guess what? It's our turn. Amen? To stand for truth. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:16.980
you for loving us. Lord, I pray that you'd help us to be mindful of the fact that we are indeed

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:27.060
living in a wicked society, but that does not cause us to lose hope. We must be mindful of the

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.140
fact that we'll be influenced by some of this wickedness, but we must resist it. And we must

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:41.860
determine that in these manners, in these ways, we shall not go. We shall not do. God, help us to

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:50.220
know your word, to understand what you've commanded us to do. Help us to be students of the

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:58.500
word of God, that we would dig in and that we would be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:10.340
Father, many within the congregation this evening have children. God, I pray that you would help us

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:18.660
to biblically influence our children. We understand the enemy is seeking to destroy and

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.740
devour. We understand the society is seeking to influence greatly and to capture the minds and

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:32.980
hearts of our young people. God, I pray that you'd help us to be studious so that we could be able

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:40.820
to impart the truth of your word to our children. Help them to understand that though we live in a

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:47.180
society in which they may call evil good and good evil, a society in which they may decree

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:57.780
unrighteous decrees, they may legislate wickedness, that your way is our way because you are our God.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.460
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer. We thank you for the privilege of prayer. We thank

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.740
you for answered prayer. We just ask that you'd bless the remainder of our time. For it's in

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.260
Christ's name we pray, amen. Does anyone need a prayer bulletin that did not get one this evening?

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.820
Anyone need one? All right, let's...
