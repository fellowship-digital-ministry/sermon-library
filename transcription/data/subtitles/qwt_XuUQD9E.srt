1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
number 1, 1 Peter chapter number 1, be looking at verses 3 through 9, and hold your place

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,159
and I'm going to reference a couple of other portions of Scripture before we get to 1 Peter

3
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:15,199
chapter 1, but 1 Peter chapter number 1 will be our text this morning, and the title, if

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,680
you've already looked at the back of the bulletin, Rejoicing Through Trials, Rejoicing Through

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,159
Trials, tonight we're going to look at Genesis chapter number 40 and look at this subject

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:30,360
of faithful through trials, and that's why I said they're complementary, one to the other,

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,759
and I believe, to just give a quick snippet with regard to the message this evening, I

8
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,959
believe that a great key to being faithful through trials is learning what we're going

9
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:43,959
to look at this morning, and that is rejoicing through trials, because if we can learn to

10
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:48,880
rejoice through trials, it's going to go a long way to help us be faithful through trials.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,840
I believe the enemy wants us to quit, I believe the enemy wants us to give up, and we have

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,319
trials that we face in this world and this earth, and I believe the enemy wants us to

13
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:02,159
quit and just turn back and not live for the Lord, but we understand this morning, even

14
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,879
as we'll look at this message and then look at the message this evening, that all of us

15
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,000
have personally experienced trials.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,199
And you might say this morning, Pastor, you have no idea, I'm in the midst of a trial

17
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:17,379
right now, and I understand, a preacher of yesteryear said you're either in the midst

18
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:22,160
of one, you've just come out of one, or there's one on the horizon, and for many we can say

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,239
that's pretty true with regard to trials in our lives.

20
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,239
We may not always respond properly in the midst of a trial.

21
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm sure that if you were to evaluate your life, if I were to evaluate my life, there

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,559
are times in the midst of a trial that we do not respond appropriately, we do not respond

23
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,720
biblically.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,959
We find, however, that God has given us in His Word the instruction that we are to rejoice

25
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,959
always, not just to rejoice when things go well, when things are the way that we desire

26
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,400
for them to be, but we find that we've been given that instruction, rejoice in the Lord

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,800
always, Philippians 4 and verse number 4, and again I say unto thee, rejoice.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,160
The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,080
made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,279
And it's a determination, it's being purposed in the fact that we're going to rejoice no

31
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:26,119
matter what comes our way in that particular day, we're going to rejoice in the Lord.

32
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:30,520
And we have to be intentional about it, we have to be purposed in it, and we find that

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,679
God will bless.

34
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:36,720
Not only have we been given instruction with regard to rejoicing through trials, but we

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,639
find that as we study through the pages of this precious book that we can read the record

36
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,479
that God has given us of many who have rejoiced in the midst of great trials.

37
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,039
Their behavior in the midst of trials was appropriate and I would say was exemplary

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,600
as we have the opportunity to be able to study those portions of Scripture.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I know in my life that I will face more trials.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,160
The reality this morning is that I know in your life that you will face more trials.

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,759
We will face trials collectively, corporately as a church, and we understand that we will

42
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,259
face trials.

43
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,759
The question really this morning is not, will I face a trial?

44
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:26,160
The question this morning is this, how will I behave in the midst of the trial?

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,240
Maybe I'll turn it this way to go along with the title this morning, will I rejoice through

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
trials?

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,119
Will I rejoice through trials?

48
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:38,320
And I told you to look at 1 Peter and I would get there in a moment, but I want to read

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,800
three portions of Scripture very quickly this morning.

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,639
The first one is from the book of Habakkuk, and I want to read Habakkuk chapter number

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,800
three.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,160
And as we look in Habakkuk chapter number three and look at what the prophet of old

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,080
says with regard to rejoicing, again we'll look at two other examples in the New Testament

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,820
as we get into the message this morning, and understanding that we've been given that command

55
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,300
that we are to rejoice in the Lord always.

56
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,940
Again, as we mentioned, the psalmist made that great declaration in Psalm 118.

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,699
We sing the song, but it says, this is the day which the Lord hath made.

58
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,660
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

59
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,459
And we find here that Habakkuk, if you found your place there in Habakkuk chapter number

60
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,299
three, notice in verse 17, notice what the Bible says, although the fig tree shall not

61
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,299
blossom.

62
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,339
That's not a good situation.

63
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,940
The fig tree is supposed to blossom, amen, produce fruit.

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,179
Neither shall fruit be in the vines.

65
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:41,239
That's unfortunate.

66
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:48,100
The labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat.

67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,420
The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.

68
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,420
If you read Habakkuk 3 in verse 17, that paints a very, very dim picture.

69
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,260
Would you agree?

70
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,940
The Bible says that the fig tree shall not blossom, the fruit shall not be on the vines,

71
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,640
the labor of the olive shall fail, the field shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,100
off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.

73
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:22,540
And yet the writer says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

74
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,260
Habakkuk, did you see what you just wrote in verse 17?

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Yeah.

76
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:32,540
That's why I said it's purposed, it's intentional.

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,100
It's a, I'm going to rejoice in the Lord always.

78
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,339
I'm going to determine, even in the midst, going through the trials of life, I'm going

79
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,739
to determine that I'm going to rejoice.

80
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,380
He says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,899
I will joy in the God of my salvation.

82
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:58,980
The Lord God is my strength and He will make my feet like Heinz feet and He will make me

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,019
to walk upon mine high places to the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

84
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,420
And I want you to just see the determination, the resolve, if you will, of Habakkuk in verse

85
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,940
18, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

86
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,700
Listen, God is good.

87
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,320
God is good.

88
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,100
God is good all of the time.

89
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,980
God is not good based on your circumstances, based on what you're dealing with in life.

90
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,500
No, God is good.

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,220
Taste and see that the Lord is good.

92
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,220
He is gracious.

93
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,700
We can look and we'll mention as we get through the message this morning about what Peter

94
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,779
says with regard to this subject there in 1 Peter chapter number one with rejoicing

95
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:41,779
through trials.

96
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:47,859
But we understand that even as Peter would be writing, he says in the second chapter,

97
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:51,220
you don't need to turn there, but he says, if so be that you have tasted that the Lord

98
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
is gracious.

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
God is gracious.

100
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
He's good.

101
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,339
He's a great God.

102
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,420
Notice in Acts chapter number five, we see the first example.

103
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,980
We find that God's given us the command that we're to rejoice in the Lord all way.

104
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,700
We find there in the book of Habakkuk that Habakkuk says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

105
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,380
Though all of those negatives that are mentioned in verse 17, yet I will rejoice.

106
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,299
Notice in Acts chapter number five, we do not have the time this morning to develop

107
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,820
all that is taking place in Acts chapter number five, but let me say this, the disciples are

108
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,940
facing some real difficulty in Acts chapter number five.

109
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,260
They have been in a position where they've been preaching the gospel after the ascension

110
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,579
of the Lord Jesus Christ and after the day of Pentecost and they're facing the persecution.

111
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,420
The religious leaders are not happy with the growth of the New Testament church and all

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
that's taking place.

113
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,660
In fact, they tell them that they're not to speak anymore in the name of the Lord Jesus

114
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,579
Christ and yet when they're standing in Acts five before this religious group of leaders,

115
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,420
they say that you've filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and they're trying to figure

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,940
out what they can do to stop these individuals from continuing to preach the gospel.

117
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,140
And after they're having this conversation and all that's taking place, we find that

118
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,339
Gamaliel stands up.

119
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,019
He's a doctor of the law, according to verse number 34, and he gives his opinion, he gives

120
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,100
his counsel with regard to the circumstances and we find that in verse 38 it says,

121
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,940
And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone.

122
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,140
For if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught.

123
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,380
But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest happily ye be found even to fight against

124
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
God.

125
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,419
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that we're not just, it's not my cause.

126
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,419
It's not your cause.

127
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,419
It's the cause of Christ.

128
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,099
And that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

129
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,820
It's not a work of just men.

130
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,260
It's the cause of Christ.

131
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,940
And notice it says, And to him they agreed.

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,739
They as the religious leaders and him as Gamaliel.

133
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,099
And they agreed with his counsel.

134
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,099
They agreed with what he says.

135
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:57,700
And it says in verse 40, And when they had called the apostles, and notice these three

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,380
words and beaten them, and beaten them, the Bible says they commanded that they should

137
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,460
not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.

138
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,380
And they departed from the presence of the council.

139
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:16,099
Notice this next phrase, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his

140
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,099
name.

141
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,099
You know what they were doing?

142
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,580
They were rejoicing through trials.

143
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,619
They were beaten, and yet they left rejoicing.

144
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:29,940
They were commanded, and yet the Bible says that they daily in verse 42 and in the temple

145
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,059
and every house, they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

146
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,359
The very thing that caused them to be beaten, they said, no, we're going to keep on doing

147
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,359
that.

148
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,359
Why?

149
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,359
Because we are his witnesses.

150
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:48,960
We find that here in Acts chapter 16, another example, we find specifically in Acts 16 that

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
of Paul and Silas.

152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,400
And again, we won't take the time to read the entire context of what's taking place,

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,919
but we know that in Acts 16, they come to Philippi.

154
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,960
The work of the Lord is going on.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,360
And we know that there was that demon-possessed girl, and we find that Paul gave command,

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,960
and she… the owners, they were going to lose gain, and so they're very angry, and

157
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,560
they cause for Paul and Silas to be imprisoned and to be beaten.

158
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,000
The Bible tells us in verse 22, "...until the multitude rose up together against them,

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,360
and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them.

160
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,080
When they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,240
to keep them safely.

162
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,560
Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made the feet

163
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
fast in the stocks…"

164
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,440
Notice verse 25, "...and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God,

165
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
and the prisoners heard them."

166
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
You know, they were still in the midst of their trial.

167
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,420
They'd been beaten, they were still in prison, they weren't released yet.

168
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,160
We know that they will be miraculously released as we read the text of Scripture, but even

169
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,840
as we'll mention tonight in the life of Joseph, we don't always know, or they didn't

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,840
always know, though we have the record of Scripture and we can read the next event,

171
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,880
we can read what happens.

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,600
Paul and Silas, they just knew that they had been beaten and they were in prison, but they

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,440
chose to rejoice through the trial.

174
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
And at midnight, the Bible says that they prayed and sang praises unto God.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Can you imagine rejoicing through the trials?

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,320
I want you to notice with me very quickly, at the end of verse 25, it says, "...and the

177
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,840
prisoners heard them, and the prisoners heard them."

178
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,640
I would submit to you this morning, it's actually a message that I hope to develop in the future

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,000
in more detail and looking at some passages in the Old Testament as well, but I would

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,400
submit to you this morning just a thought that they were, those prisoners were going

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,080
to hear Paul and Silas regardless of what they said.

182
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,720
They were going to hear them if they complained, and they were going to hear them if they rejoiced.

183
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
You know what?

184
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
There's some people that hear us.

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I wonder what they hear.

186
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
What do they hear from us?

187
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,480
When we're going through trials, when we're going through difficulties, what do they hear?

188
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,800
What do they learn about our God as we go through trials?

189
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,760
As we look at 1 Peter chapter number 1 and look at verse 3 through 9 this morning, get

190
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,360
to our text, I believe that as we consider three truths really from this portion of Scripture

191
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,040
that I believe this morning will enable us to rejoice through trials.

192
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
Again, I know that I will face trials.

193
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,560
I know that you will face trials.

194
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,880
We understand that to be the case.

195
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,480
And what is it that God teaches us in His Word that will enable us to rejoice in the

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,940
midst of trials?

197
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,160
The question is not, will I face a trial?

198
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,640
The question is, how will I behave through the trial?

199
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,900
Notice in verse number 3 of 1 Peter 1, the Bible says, blessed be the God and Father

200
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,800
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,000
into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,840
incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who

203
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,520
are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the

204
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,840
last time.

205
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,360
Notice in verse number 6, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need

206
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,540
be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,620
precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto

208
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,140
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, whom, having not seen, ye

209
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,220
love, and whom, though now ye see Him not yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable

210
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,660
and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

211
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,820
As we look at this portion of Scripture this morning, I believe that God gives us three

212
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,920
truths that will enable us, enable you, enable me, to rejoice through trials.

213
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,340
If you're taking notes with me this morning, I would say, number one, we can rejoice through

214
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,240
trials because of our position in Christ.

215
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,420
What is it that will enable me to rejoice in the midst of trials?

216
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,120
It's when I remember my position in Christ.

217
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,520
Peter is writing to believers here in the book of 1 Peter.

218
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,820
Notice in verse 1, the Bible says, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers

219
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,440
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect according to the

220
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,540
foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling

221
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,740
of the blood of Jesus Christ, grace unto you, and peace be multiplied.

222
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,460
He then tells them and speaks to them in verses 3 and 4 and verse number 5 as well about their

223
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,060
position in Christ.

224
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,640
I want you to understand that these believers that Peter is writing to here in 1 Peter,

225
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,320
these are believers that are facing great difficulty.

226
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,920
These are believers that are living during the time of the Emperor Nero's rule and reign

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,000
and what a wicked and ungodly man he was and so cruel.

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,800
And we find that they're living at that particular time and they're facing great difficulties.

229
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,720
The Bible says to the strangers scattered throughout.

230
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Why were they scattered?

231
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,420
Well, because of the persecution that was intensifying under the rule and reign of the

232
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,080
Emperor Nero.

233
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,140
And we find that as these believers are being written to that God in His grace and His mercy

234
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,740
is going to help them understand truth that will enable them even in the midst of this

235
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,100
great difficulty, even in the midst of this trial, that they can not only rejoice but

236
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,820
according to verse number 6, greatly rejoice.

237
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,180
Not only greatly rejoice, but we find that in verse number 8 that ye rejoice with joy

238
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,620
unspeakable and full of glory.

239
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,940
Now there is a truth that is given to us in these first few verses of chapter number 1

240
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,740
that enables us to understand our position in Christ.

241
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm so thankful to be washed in the blood.

242
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,000
We sang that song this morning, are you washed in the blood, and how appropriate as we think

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,120
about that song, and often I will say as we're singing the chorus of that song, when

244
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,240
it says are you washed in the blood, I'll say yes I am.

245
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Dean hollers out something else when he's leading it, I don't even know half the time

246
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,600
what he's saying, but I'm sitting here saying yes I am, amen?

247
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,720
I am washed in the blood, and I'm so thankful that my position in Christ is settled.

248
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,520
If you're a believer this morning, if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

249
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,000
Savior, you understood that you were a sinner, and that Christ is the only Savior, and that

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,040
He offers you a gift, and that gift is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, then you

251
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,440
have been born again, you have been born of the Spirit, and your position in Christ is

252
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,760
settled, and we can rejoice in that.

253
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,160
Listen, nobody can take your salvation.

254
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
I'm thankful for that.

255
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,880
The Bible says in John chapter number 10, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and

256
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,760
I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck

257
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,260
them from my hand, and we see the security of the believer.

258
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:07,080
We see it here in 1 Peter 1 as well, but we understand this morning that there is no trial

259
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,800
that you can go through, there is no trial that I can go through that will alter my position

260
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,560
in Christ.

261
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,760
That should cause us to rejoice.

262
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,120
You say, but pastor, let me tell you about this trial.

263
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,560
I'm just trying to remind you of your position in Christ.

264
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm trying to help you understand that yes, the trials will vary, and some are going to

265
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,400
be harder than others, and more intense, and maybe longer, and whatever it might be, but

266
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,840
the reality is that nothing, no trial here on earth can alter your position in Christ.

267
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,280
So when I'm going through that trial, I remind myself I'm a child of the King.

268
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,920
I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.

269
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,800
My standing is settled, it's sure.

270
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm heaven-bound.

271
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
All these other things are just temporary.

272
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
In fact, look at it with me in verse number three.

273
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,920
It says, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, notice it says, which

274
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,520
according to His abundant mercy, aren't you thankful that our God is merciful?

275
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,920
His mercy is everlasting.

276
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,260
His mercy is abundant.

277
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,040
He is rich in mercy.

278
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,840
It says that He hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus

279
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,040
Christ from the dead.

280
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,560
Listen, if Christ be not risen, then our faith is vain, and our preaching is vain, but now

281
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,720
is Christ risen from the dead.

282
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
He is the firstfruits of them which slept, and the Bible tells us, and we understand

283
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,160
this morning, that I serve a risen Savior, and He lives, and how precious that is.

284
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,200
We understand this morning because He lives because of the resurrection and my understanding

285
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,640
of my position in Christ.

286
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,679
He goes on to explain it in verse number four, notice, to an inheritance incorruptible and

287
00:18:52,679 --> 00:19:03,160
undefiled, notice this, and fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

288
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Every word of God is pure.

289
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,440
I love the way that He explains that in verse number four.

290
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,000
He could have just said that you have an inheritance.

291
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,840
And by the way, that would have been sufficient because of the sufficiency of Scripture.

292
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:23,480
But we find that He wanted us to really understand this inheritance that we have, that it's incorruptible,

293
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,440
that it's undefiled, that it fadeth not away, that it's reserved in heaven for us.

294
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,040
I want you to notice that phrase in verse number four where it says, fadeth not away.

295
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,840
I want you to understand this morning that the gift of God is eternal life.

296
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,520
Listen, I'm going to spend forever with my Savior.

297
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,559
My position in Christ settles that because I've been born again, because I heard the

298
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,960
gospel and I recognized I was a sinner and He's the only Savior.

299
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I was guilty.

300
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
Listen, it wasn't that I was just, oh, I wasn't that bad.

301
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,960
No, I was guilty.

302
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,000
And by the way, if you don't recognize…

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,280
recognize that you're guilty, you're never going to recognize that you need a Savior.

304
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:13,279
And I knew I was guilty. I was condemned. But He loved me. And He died for me. And He

305
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,000
saved me. And I'm going to heaven. And I have this inheritance. If you're saved this morning,

306
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,399
you have this. And it says, fadeth not away. Now, I want you to keep that in mind and look

307
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,959
at verse number six, and we'll get further into verse number six as we get through the

308
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,239
message this morning. But I want to point this out to you with regard to our position

309
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:36,360
in Christ. It says this, the position, the fact that we have an inheritance that fadeth

310
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,560
not away in verse number four, but then look at verse six. It says wherein ye greatly rejoice.

311
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,680
Then notice this, though now for a season. Listen, I'm thankful that a season doesn't

312
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:58,919
define us. A season's not forever. You say, how long's a season? I don't know. I have

313
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:07,239
no idea. It's as long as God wants it to be. In fact, in 1 Peter chapter number 5 and verse

314
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:11,040
number 10, it says, but the God of all grace, who hath caught us into His eternal glory

315
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:18,239
by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make ye perfect, establish, strengthen,

316
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,559
and excel you. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. I don't know how long

317
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:30,680
a while is either, but I know that a season pales in comparison to fadeth not away. Amen?

318
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,480
See, we've got to keep that eternal perspective. Sometimes in the midst of the trial, we have

319
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,639
that temporal perspective, and we're so focused on the season that we're not focused on the

320
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:48,279
eternal, on the fadeth not away. And here, these believers that are facing this great

321
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,839
persecution and all this difficulty, these trials that they're going through, Peter says

322
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,279
to them, listen, if you're going to rejoice and if you're going to greatly rejoice through

323
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,440
these trials, I believe that one of the truths that he shares here that will enable these

324
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,680
believers, that will enable you and I this morning to rejoice through trials, is that

325
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,399
we must remember our position in Christ. I'm a child of the King. Remember what Jesus said

326
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:20,320
in Luke chapter number 10? These fellows come back and they're rejoicing because the spirits

327
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,240
are in subject to them, and they're coming back and they're rejoicing over these things.

328
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,320
And we find that in Luke chapter number 10 and verse 17, the Bible says that the 70 returned,

329
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,919
they returned with joy. And they're talking about what happened and what transpired and

330
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,880
what they experienced, but Jesus says to them in Luke 10 and verse number 20, notwithstanding

331
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,660
in this and what they had experienced, he says, in this rejoice not that the spirits

332
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:55,639
are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. We sing

333
00:22:55,639 --> 00:23:02,179
that song, there's a new name written down in glory. And it's mine. Oh yes, it's mine.

334
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:05,860
And we sing that song and it reminds us of the day that we trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

335
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,979
as our personal Savior. And Jesus says to these 70 that returned, they came back with

336
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:16,179
joy. And Jesus says, listen, don't rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you.

337
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,419
Rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. I'm so thankful that on, for me,

338
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:28,300
August 31st, 1997, my name was written down in that book. I was born again. I was saved

339
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:36,979
by the grace of God. And my position in Christ allows me to rejoice through the trials.

340
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:43,000
Number two, we can rejoice through trials because of God's great power. I'm thankful

341
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,860
for my position in Christ and I'm thankful that I serve the omnipotent God. I think about

342
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,839
the power of God here in verse number five, continuing really with the thought of our

343
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,580
position in Christ and the inheritance that we have. He says, who are kept by the power

344
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:03,119
of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. This morning

345
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,279
I am so thankful that our God is the omnipotent God. I am thankful that I am kept by the power

346
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,440
of God. I'm thankful that there's nothing that's too hard for my God. I'm thankful this

347
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,279
morning that in the midst of a trial, in the midst of a difficulty, that God did not lose

348
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,079
any power. That God is not, it's not that a matter of His ability or inability. No,

349
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:28,799
we find that God is able. And we find that in the midst of that trial, when we focus

350
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:36,399
and understand that my God has all power and my God is able, that enables me to rejoice.

351
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:42,760
I think about Abraham and there in Genesis, when he's being spoken to by the Lord. And

352
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:50,200
Abraham is told by God that his name, one of his names is El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

353
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,559
I love that name of the Lord that he shares with Abraham there. And we find that he says,

354
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,200
my name, it's El Shaddai, I'm the Lord God Almighty. And then right after he reveals

355
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,519
that to him, he asks him, is there anything too hard for me? We find that Jeremiah is

356
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:12,440
asked a similar question as Jeremiah is prophesying on the eve of captivity. In fact, he's prophesying

357
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,839
and the Babylonians have already laid siege against the city. And he can see, he knows,

358
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,320
he's the one that's been prophesying that they're going to take us captive. And then

359
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,839
God comes to Jeremiah and says that he's supposed to buy a piece of property, buy the field,

360
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:37,519
buy the field. But they're going to come and take, buy the field. And God explains to him

361
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,320
about the remnant that's going to return, the 70 year captivity and all that's going

362
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,559
to transpire and that they would dwell in that land again. And you know what? You know

363
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:52,239
what he understood? He understood that there's nothing too hard for God. God is all powerful.

364
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,559
Listen as we look at the examples that we looked at this morning in the book of Habakkuk

365
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,920
and two examples in the book of Acts, they served, Habakkuk, the disciples and Paul and

366
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,760
Silas, they served the same God that we serve, the Lord God Omnipotent. He rules and he reigns.

367
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,359
And this morning I am so thankful that his power is never lacking, that it's never a

368
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,799
situation when you're going through a trial, when I'm going through a trial, it's understood

369
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,200
that it's allowed by God. And God can change that thing at any time because he has all

370
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,600
power. I'm thankful to know the Omnipotent God, aren't you? I'm thankful to know the

371
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,239
God that said let there be light and there was light. I'm thankful that though today

372
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:39,799
they're still trying to determine with some level of accuracy the total number of stars

373
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,160
and all of the things of our galaxies and what have you, and the scriptures simply say

374
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,279
and he made the stars also. This is a little thing for God because he has all power. And

375
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,760
that's your God and that's my God. When I'm in the midst of the trial, when I'm in the

376
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,799
midst of the difficulty and I remind myself of my position in Christ, that I'm saved by

377
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:07,920
the blood of the Lamb, that I'm going to heaven one day, that nothing can alter my position

378
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,200
in Christ, it causes me to rejoice. When I recognize and I'm reminded of the great

379
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,679
power of my God, that he is the Lord God Omnipotent, that he's able to do exceeding abundantly

380
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:25,559
above all that we ask or think, that's my God. And when I remind myself of that, I can

381
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:36,079
rejoice in the midst of the trial. Number three, we can rejoice through trials because

382
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:42,359
of God's purpose. Because of God's purpose. We see that we rejoice through trials because

383
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,600
of my position in Christ. We rejoice through trials because of God's great power. But you

384
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,600
and I this morning, we can rejoice through trials because of God's purpose. Let me remind

385
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,799
you this morning that God always has purpose. He moves with purpose. And we find that God

386
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,760
is a God of purpose and everything that happens in your life and everything that happens in

387
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
my life is for a purpose. Notice in verse number six of our text of Scripture, in 1

388
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,640
Peter 1 and verse number six, the Bible says this, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now

389
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,399
for a season. Listen, your home is in heaven, you have this inheritance and your position

390
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:30,880
in Christ is settled, but before you get there, you might have this trial for a season. And

391
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:42,719
then notice these words, if need be. If need be. Ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

392
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:49,760
As we see this phrase, if need be, in verse number six, it reminds me of God's purpose.

393
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,479
It reminds me this morning, and it's important for each of us to understand. Listen, I believe

394
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:59,919
it's imperative that we each understand this morning that God always has a purpose. If

395
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,719
need be. Who determines that? Not you and not me. God. If it were up to me, I'd never

396
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:13,159
need be. Amen? And if it were up to you, you probably would never need be either because

397
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:21,479
we just don't really like trials. But God has a purpose. God has a purpose. And there

398
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:28,719
are times in your life and there are times in my life that God allows a trial and we're

399
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:33,760
reminded of our position in Christ, we're reminded of God's power. Those are going to

400
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,960
enable us to rejoice, but when we're reminded that God has a purpose in this. This didn't

401
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,400
happen by accident. This was not some situation that caught God off guard. It was not a situation...

402
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,039
Listen, has anything ever caught you off guard? You're working, you're doing something, you

403
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,960
say, man, I didn't see that coming. I didn't expect that. It doesn't matter how well you

404
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,159
are at what you do. It doesn't matter how skillful you are. It doesn't matter how much

405
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,039
you've planned and...

406
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,399
prepared and so on and so forth, there are things that might happen that you say, man,

407
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,479
I didn't plan for that. I didn't think that was going to happen. That never happens to

408
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:19,479
God. God knows everything. And God does all things well. Our God is perfect.

409
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:24,599
In this morning when we are reminded that we can rejoice through trials because God

410
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:33,999
has a purpose, we find that it says, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

411
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:40,559
Notice that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,

412
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:48,839
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing

413
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:54,719
of Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, ye love, and whom though now ye see him not,

414
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:59,719
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your

415
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:04,479
faith, even the salvation of your souls. I'll read also in 1 Peter 5, I read these verses

416
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:11,079
a moment ago, but notice in verse 10 and 11 of 1 Peter 5, it says, but the God of all

417
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:16,759
grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have

418
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:24,159
suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. To him be glory and

419
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:32,159
dominion forever and ever. Amen. From these two portions of Scripture in 1 Peter 1, verses

420
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,479
6 through 9, and in 1 Peter 5, verses 10 and 11, we really have the opportunity through

421
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:44,959
these two portions of Scripture in 1 Peter to understand two purposes that God has. First

422
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:51,119
and foremost, I believe that God's purpose is to bring honor and glory to himself. That's

423
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:59,759
the primary purpose, is for God to be honored and glorified. And we find that at times God

424
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:06,959
will allow a trial in your life and he'll allow a trial in my life, and as we are reminded

425
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:12,159
of God's, of our position in Christ and of God's power and understanding his purpose,

426
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,359
and we understand that through this God is to be honored and glorified. I may not see

427
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,719
at the start of the trial exactly how it is that God's going to be honored and glorified,

428
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:26,359
but I can understand and I can rest assured that God has a purpose in the midst of that

429
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:33,879
trial. And I'm so thankful that God in the midst of the trial is to be honored and glorified.

430
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:37,439
Notice if you will, take your Bibles and turn back to the book of John if you will, and

431
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:44,119
I want to show you a thought here in John chapter number 11, and I want you to see,

432
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:49,879
I'm in Luke, I better get over to John, I went too far. In John chapter number 11, it's

433
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:55,719
a familiar passage of Scripture. The Bible tells us in John chapter 11 that near the

434
00:32:55,719 --> 00:33:00,799
end of the passage that Jesus stands and says, Lazarus, come forth. And we all know what

435
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,159
happens in this portion of Scripture. Lazarus comes walking out of the grave. He was dead

436
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:14,679
for four days, and the concern was that he surely stinketh by now. But we find at the

437
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,679
very beginning of this passage of Scripture in John chapter 11 that Lazarus falls sick,

438
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,879
and Mary and Martha, they believed not only that the Lord Jesus Christ loved their brother,

439
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:31,079
but I believe that they, and you study through the passage of Scripture, they believed that

440
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:37,039
Jesus had the ability to heal Lazarus of whatever the sickness was. In fact, they both

441
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,239
protest when Jesus arrives that if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. Not only

442
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:48,319
did Mary and Martha believe that, but I would say to you that the Jews that were gathered

443
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,279
together that were wailing and that were mourning with the family, that they also say in verse

444
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,439
number 37, could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even

445
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:04,679
this man should not have died? They believe. Listen, the account in John chapter 10 of

446
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,319
the pool of Bethesda and the eyes being open, I mean, that's an amazing truth that is given

447
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:14,999
to us, and we find that there as we look at what's happening and looking at that context

448
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:20,279
that now, John chapter number 9, excuse me, we find that there this man that was born

449
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:25,679
blind, he was blind from his birth, that these Jews, they say, could not this man that healed

450
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:33,159
that man that was blind, could not, he could have healed this man. And so Mary and Martha

451
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:40,439
believe that Jesus was able, and therefore they send for him. Now, we believe that Jesus

452
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:46,759
is able, so what do we do? We pray. Jesus is not here physically with us as he was in

453
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:51,759
John chapter 11, the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, when he took on the form

454
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:57,559
of a man, he never ceased being God, he's the God-man, and we find that at the incarnation

455
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:02,079
he comes in this ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ's earthly ministry in John chapter

456
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,839
11, we find that they were able to send physically for Jesus to come. Jesus is not here physically

457
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,479
anymore. We understand that we have the Holy Spirit of God that indwells us, we understand

458
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,239
the Bible says that he ascended to heaven, and one day, one glorious day, he's coming

459
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,339
back for us and how we should rejoice in that, but he's at the right hand of the Father,

460
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:29,799
he ever liveth, the Bible says, to make intercession for us. And we cannot go call for Jesus that

461
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:34,599
he's down at the, the, the wherever he is and bring him here physically like they could,

462
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:40,039
but we pray. Why do we pray? Well, because we believe that Jesus is able. But when Jesus

463
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:48,919
finds out about he whom thou lovest is sick, Jesus didn't immediately go. He tarried because

464
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:54,999
he had a purpose. Notice in verse number 4 of John 11, the Bible says when Jesus heard

465
00:35:54,999 --> 00:36:02,039
that, heard what? That Lazarus was sick, he said, the sickness is not unto death, but

466
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:09,399
then notice these words, but for the glory of God, but for the glory of God, that the

467
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:15,319
Son of God might be glorified thereby. Listen, in your life and in my life, we go through

468
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:20,439
trials. One of the purposes that God has is that he would receive the honor and glory.

469
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:26,599
You say, man, this trial is just, it's just overwhelming and I can't, how's God going

470
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,759
to get glory through it? If we're complaining and murmuring and we're just kind of, it's

471
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:37,719
going to make it pretty tough. But when we understand that he has a purpose, we say,

472
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,479
God, I'm not sure what you're doing here, but I know that you do all things well. I

473
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:45,879
know, God, that you make no mistakes. God, I know that you have a purpose in this. And

474
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:51,399
God, I pray that through this somehow you would receive the honor and the glory, that

475
00:36:51,399 --> 00:37:01,879
your name would be exalted, that you would be magnified through this trial. Not only

476
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:05,079
is he seeking to bring honor and glory to himself, but he's seeking to develop you and

477
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:14,919
I spiritually. He's seeking to develop us spiritually. You know, growth has challenges.

478
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:18,799
You ever hear somebody speak medically about physical growth and they talk about growing

479
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:24,719
pains? You ever hear somebody use that phraseology? My brother, he grew about six inches one summer

480
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,079
and he had terrible pain in his knees for several months because of what the doctor

481
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,639
said is that he grew so fast that all those ligaments and what have you were stretched

482
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,719
out and it was just causing him pain. And they said, just bear with it for a little

483
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:42,359
while and it will go away. And eventually that kind of happened. But you hear that thing

484
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,919
of growing pains. Listen, when you grow, if you want to go work out, I was working out

485
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:49,599
with Joseph and he's at that age where he wants to start lifting weights and so I'm

486
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,159
lifting weights with Joseph. And guess what happens after you lift weights when you haven't

487
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,559
done it for a while? You're sore. And so you know what Joseph likes to do, Tim? He likes

488
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,519
to come over to me and he likes to do this right here. How's that feel, daddy? How's

489
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,319
this feel, daddy? Why? Because he knows that that's sore because of the muscles that we

490
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:15,439
worked. It's just how it works. Sometimes the growth spiritually requires a trial. But

491
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:20,199
God's developing us. You say, but I don't want that pain. I don't want that. But God's

492
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:25,839
growing you. You're going to learn something that you would not learn under any other circumstance.

493
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,599
Notice here in John 11, after Jesus delays, he tells the disciples that we're going to

494
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,440
go. And he says in verse number 11, these things said he, and after that he saith unto

495
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,119
them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may wake him out of sleep. Then said

496
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,519
his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death,

497
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,119
but they thought that he had spoken of taking a rest and sleep. Then said Jesus unto them

498
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:02,199
plainly, Lazarus is dead. But then I want you to catch verse 15. Jesus says this, I

499
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:13,679
am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe. Nevertheless,

500
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:21,839
let us go unto him. He says, I am glad for your sakes that I was not there. Listen, there's

501
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,719
some things that God's going to teach us in the midst of trials that we're only going

502
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:33,599
to learn through the trial. It's just the way it works. Some of you do various things

503
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,239
for a living that require certain types of training. And there are times in which you

504
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,599
engage in training that you hope you never have to use. But you learn some things through

505
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:53,599
that process. And God, as he's bringing, as he's allowing trials in your life and in my

506
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,119
life, I am able to rejoice. I'm able to have joy unspeakable and full of glory. I'm able

507
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,079
to rejoice greatly.

508
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,579
in the midst of the trial, why?

509
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,479
Because I understand my position in Christ.

510
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:07,559
This trial that I'm going through

511
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:10,799
is not going to change my position in Christ.

512
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,719
It's not gonna alter it one bit.

513
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,559
It's not gonna change that I'm going to heaven one day.

514
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,119
This trial that I'm going through,

515
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,239
I know that my God has all power,

516
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,819
and I know that my God is able,

517
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,279
and I know that he is able to do something amazing,

518
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:25,759
and I trust him, and I'm following him,

519
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,519
and I'm rejoicing because it's kind of that idea

520
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:31,879
of anticipating and expecting what's God going to do.

521
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,839
You remember the disciples when they're

522
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,339
in the midst of the storm on the boat?

523
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:38,919
By the way, they were in the midst of the storm

524
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,639
because Jesus told them, go to the other side.

525
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:47,059
This idea this morning that trials are always,

526
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,319
100% of the time, a result of your sin

527
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:51,799
or my sin is not biblical.

528
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,759
Now there are some times that,

529
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,999
the way of the transgressor is hard.

530
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,759
There are some times that sin results

531
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,919
in some hardship and some difficulty,

532
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,719
but I would submit to you this morning

533
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,559
that there are times in which you,

534
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,999
there are times that I may be right in the midst

535
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:08,639
of a great storm of a trial simply because I'm obeying God,

536
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,639
simply because I'm following the leadership

537
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,319
of the Holy Spirit of God,

538
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,839
and I find myself in the midst of a trial.

539
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,399
Such was the case for the disciples on that day,

540
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:22,759
and they find themselves in the midst of a great storm,

541
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:25,879
and Jesus then says, peace be still, and the storm is calm.

542
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,959
They got to see the power.

543
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,519
What manner of man is this

544
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,079
that even the winds and the waves obey him?

545
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,439
They get to learn some things.

546
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,719
Listen, if there was never a storm,

547
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,319
they never would have seen that power.

548
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:40,399
If there was never a storm,

549
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,639
you would never be able to read the account.

550
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,879
I'd never be able to preach or teach the account

551
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:48,279
of Jesus demonstrating his power over the storm.

552
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,899
They needed to go through a storm.

553
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:55,899
This morning, God has a purpose.

554
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:59,979
His purpose, first and foremost,

555
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:02,339
is to bring honor and glory to himself.

556
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,939
Secondly, it's to develop us spiritually.

557
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,419
Notice, it says that the trial of your faith

558
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,739
in 1 Peter 1 and verse number seven,

559
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:12,099
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth.

560
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,999
That'll put some things in perspective

561
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:18,139
as to what is important and what's the priority.

562
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:22,659
He says, though it be tried with fire,

563
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,899
might be found in the praise and honor and glory

564
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:26,339
at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

565
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,899
Listen, one day, he's coming back.

566
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:29,819
One day, I'm going to see him.

567
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:34,299
We sang last week, face to face, I shall behold him.

568
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,099
One day, I'm going to see my savior.

569
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,099
Man, that should encourage every single believer

570
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,859
this morning, I'm going to see him.

571
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:45,619
We find, it says that we can have this joy,

572
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:46,979
unspeakable and full of glory

573
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:48,739
in 1 Peter 5 and verse 10.

574
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,259
It says that after you've suffered a while,

575
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,059
that he will make you perfect,

576
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:55,059
establish, strengthen, and settle you.

577
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:56,299
I want you to think about that work

578
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:57,939
that God's doing through the trial

579
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,539
and developing us spiritually.

580
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,979
No doubt that we could stand here this morning

581
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,259
and we could give testimonies.

582
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:05,899
We could open up for opportunity

583
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,179
for some to give some testimonies this morning

584
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:11,059
of, listen, how has God taught you certain things?

585
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:13,059
How has God grown you spiritually?

586
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,139
And I can guarantee you that there will be some trials

587
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:19,419
that are referenced as to how God developed us.

588
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:26,979
Job said it this way in Job 23.

589
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:36,499
Verse number 10, but he knoweth the way that I take.

590
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:42,539
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

591
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,059
As gold.

592
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,859
I want you to think about Job just for a moment.

593
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,339
You say, man, I had a bad day.

594
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:52,299
Read Job.

595
00:43:55,939 --> 00:43:57,139
Seriously.

596
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:59,019
How many of you have read Job before?

597
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,659
Okay.

598
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:03,299
If you've read Job,

599
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:08,939
I'm guessing that you've never had a day like Job had.

600
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:18,539
And Job says, he knoweth the way that I take.

601
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:24,179
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

602
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:27,619
Ron Hamilton wrote a song

603
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,059
that goes along with this verse of Scripture.

604
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,619
Man, what a powerful truth.

605
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,099
James says it this way, and we'll close with this

606
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:41,619
in James one, verses two through four.

607
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:46,099
Notice here,

608
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,819
James says, my brethren, count it all joy

609
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:58,299
when you fall into divers temptations.

610
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,539
Rejoicing through trials.

611
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,859
Count it all joy.

612
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:08,179
Temptations, trials, divers, various sorts.

613
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:11,299
Then notice these two words,

614
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:12,819
and I think they're so important.

615
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,059
Knowing this.

616
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:19,499
There's some things that God wants his people to know.

617
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:24,499
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith

618
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:29,499
worketh patience, but let patience have her perfect work,

619
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:35,419
that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

620
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:42,619
That's maturity, Christian maturity, perfect.

621
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:47,619
Not sinless, but complete, that idea of maturity.

622
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:53,699
And it says that knowing this, this morning,

623
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:56,219
the question is not whether you'll have a trial.

624
00:45:57,419 --> 00:45:58,899
The question really for us this morning

625
00:45:58,899 --> 00:46:02,139
is how do we respond in the midst of the trial?

626
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:07,139
Can we rejoice through trials?

627
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:11,779
We're commanded to do so.

628
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:15,419
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.

629
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:17,779
This is the day the Lord hath made.

630
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:21,099
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

631
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,779
We can see some people in the pages of scripture,

632
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,939
I've just looked at three references this morning,

633
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:30,099
that face great difficulty, and yet they rejoiced.

634
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,059
So absolutely we can rejoice through trials.

635
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:38,219
This is not an exhaustive list this morning,

636
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:41,779
but from 1 Peter 1, just three simple thoughts,

637
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:46,099
truths that will enable you, that will enable me

638
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,899
to rejoice in the midst of trial.

639
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:52,499
Number one, remember your position in Christ.

640
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:55,739
What a joy to be saved, what a joy.

641
00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,739
No man, no thing can alter your position in Christ.

642
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:05,459
Remember the power of God in the midst of your trial.

643
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:06,819
Remember God's power.

644
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:08,739
We serve the Lord God omnipotent.

645
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:10,459
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above

646
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,579
all that we ask or think.

647
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,539
And then finally this morning,

648
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,819
remember that God has a purpose.

649
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:17,699
It's never by accident.

650
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,599
It's never for naught.

651
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,899
It's not just an exercise to,

652
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:24,159
well we got nothing else to do today,

653
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,319
so we're just gonna have you do this.

654
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,519
It's not busy work, it's not, no, no, no.

655
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:28,599
There's a purpose.

656
00:47:30,439 --> 00:47:33,199
First and foremost, that God will be glorified.

657
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,319
And secondly, that we'd be developed,

658
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,319
that we'd grow spiritually,

659
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,339
that we'd come to that place of spiritual maturity.

660
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:46,199
Trials, rejoicing through trials.

661
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,039
Let's pray.

662
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,079
Father, we love you.

663
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,759
We thank you for loving us.

664
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,839
We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us

665
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,119
this morning to gather together.

666
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,519
We thank you for the word of God.

667
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:58,979
We thank you for the truth.

668
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,279
God, I know that I will face trials.

669
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:06,159
I know that each one that sits here this morning

670
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:07,439
will face trials.

671
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,659
And God, I pray that you would enable us

672
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,039
to rejoice through trials,

673
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,879
that these three truths from 1 Peter 1

674
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:18,359
would just permeate our minds,

675
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,439
that we'd be reminded in the midst of trial

676
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,479
of our position in Christ,

677
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:27,959
of your great power and of your purpose.

678
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:29,439
Lord, maybe this morning there's some

679
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,879
that are just going through trials, difficulties.

680
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:36,599
Lord, I pray that you'd help them this morning.

681
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,639
Lord, for one that says, man, I have nothing,

682
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:39,599
no trial right now.

683
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,279
God, help them to store this

684
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:47,279
and to be ready to return to it when that trial does come.

685
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:51,679
Lord, that you'd help us to rejoice through trials.

686
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,119
There's one that's not sure of heaven,

687
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:53,999
they've never been saved.

688
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:55,959
Lord, I pray that today they'd be saved

689
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:00,399
so they'd know that position that they have in Christ.

690
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,519
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

691
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,599
and we'll give you the glory for it.

692
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,719
It's in Christ's name we pray.

693
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:06,559
Would you stand with me?

694
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,399
Heads or backs?
