WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
number 1, 1 Peter chapter number 1, be looking at verses 3 through 9, and hold your place

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.159
and I'm going to reference a couple of other portions of Scripture before we get to 1 Peter

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:15.199
chapter 1, but 1 Peter chapter number 1 will be our text this morning, and the title, if

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.680
you've already looked at the back of the bulletin, Rejoicing Through Trials, Rejoicing Through

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.159
Trials, tonight we're going to look at Genesis chapter number 40 and look at this subject

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.360
of faithful through trials, and that's why I said they're complementary, one to the other,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.759
and I believe, to just give a quick snippet with regard to the message this evening, I

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:39.959
believe that a great key to being faithful through trials is learning what we're going

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:43.959
to look at this morning, and that is rejoicing through trials, because if we can learn to

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:48.880
rejoice through trials, it's going to go a long way to help us be faithful through trials.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.840
I believe the enemy wants us to quit, I believe the enemy wants us to give up, and we have

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.319
trials that we face in this world and this earth, and I believe the enemy wants us to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.159
quit and just turn back and not live for the Lord, but we understand this morning, even

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.879
as we'll look at this message and then look at the message this evening, that all of us

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.000
have personally experienced trials.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.199
And you might say this morning, Pastor, you have no idea, I'm in the midst of a trial

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:17.379
right now, and I understand, a preacher of yesteryear said you're either in the midst

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:22.160
of one, you've just come out of one, or there's one on the horizon, and for many we can say

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.239
that's pretty true with regard to trials in our lives.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:33.239
We may not always respond properly in the midst of a trial.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.120
I'm sure that if you were to evaluate your life, if I were to evaluate my life, there

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.559
are times in the midst of a trial that we do not respond appropriately, we do not respond

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:43.720
biblically.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.959
We find, however, that God has given us in His Word the instruction that we are to rejoice

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.959
always, not just to rejoice when things go well, when things are the way that we desire

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.400
for them to be, but we find that we've been given that instruction, rejoice in the Lord

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.800
always, Philippians 4 and verse number 4, and again I say unto thee, rejoice.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.160
The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.080
made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.279
And it's a determination, it's being purposed in the fact that we're going to rejoice no

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:26.119
matter what comes our way in that particular day, we're going to rejoice in the Lord.

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.520
And we have to be intentional about it, we have to be purposed in it, and we find that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.679
God will bless.

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.720
Not only have we been given instruction with regard to rejoicing through trials, but we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.639
find that as we study through the pages of this precious book that we can read the record

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:48.479
that God has given us of many who have rejoiced in the midst of great trials.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:54.039
Their behavior in the midst of trials was appropriate and I would say was exemplary

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.600
as we have the opportunity to be able to study those portions of Scripture.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.000
I know in my life that I will face more trials.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.160
The reality this morning is that I know in your life that you will face more trials.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.759
We will face trials collectively, corporately as a church, and we understand that we will

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.259
face trials.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.759
The question really this morning is not, will I face a trial?

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:26.160
The question this morning is this, how will I behave in the midst of the trial?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.240
Maybe I'll turn it this way to go along with the title this morning, will I rejoice through

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
trials?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.119
Will I rejoice through trials?

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.320
And I told you to look at 1 Peter and I would get there in a moment, but I want to read

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.800
three portions of Scripture very quickly this morning.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.639
The first one is from the book of Habakkuk, and I want to read Habakkuk chapter number

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.800
three.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.160
And as we look in Habakkuk chapter number three and look at what the prophet of old

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.080
says with regard to rejoicing, again we'll look at two other examples in the New Testament

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.820
as we get into the message this morning, and understanding that we've been given that command

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.300
that we are to rejoice in the Lord always.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.940
Again, as we mentioned, the psalmist made that great declaration in Psalm 118.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.699
We sing the song, but it says, this is the day which the Lord hath made.

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.660
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.459
And we find here that Habakkuk, if you found your place there in Habakkuk chapter number

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.299
three, notice in verse 17, notice what the Bible says, although the fig tree shall not

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:28.299
blossom.

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.339
That's not a good situation.

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:34.940
The fig tree is supposed to blossom, amen, produce fruit.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.179
Neither shall fruit be in the vines.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:41.239
That's unfortunate.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:48.100
The labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.420
The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.420
If you read Habakkuk 3 in verse 17, that paints a very, very dim picture.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.260
Would you agree?

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.940
The Bible says that the fig tree shall not blossom, the fruit shall not be on the vines,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.640
the labor of the olive shall fail, the field shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.100
off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:22.540
And yet the writer says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.260
Habakkuk, did you see what you just wrote in verse 17?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.260
Yeah.

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:32.540
That's why I said it's purposed, it's intentional.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.100
It's a, I'm going to rejoice in the Lord always.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.339
I'm going to determine, even in the midst, going through the trials of life, I'm going

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.739
to determine that I'm going to rejoice.

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:47.380
He says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.899
I will joy in the God of my salvation.

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:58.980
The Lord God is my strength and He will make my feet like Heinz feet and He will make me

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.019
to walk upon mine high places to the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:09.420
And I want you to just see the determination, the resolve, if you will, of Habakkuk in verse

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.940
18, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.700
Listen, God is good.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.320
God is good.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.100
God is good all of the time.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.980
God is not good based on your circumstances, based on what you're dealing with in life.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.500
No, God is good.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.220
Taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.220
He is gracious.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.700
We can look and we'll mention as we get through the message this morning about what Peter

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.779
says with regard to this subject there in 1 Peter chapter number one with rejoicing

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:41.779
through trials.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:47.859
But we understand that even as Peter would be writing, he says in the second chapter,

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:51.220
you don't need to turn there, but he says, if so be that you have tasted that the Lord

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220
is gracious.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.220
God is gracious.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220
He's good.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.339
He's a great God.

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.420
Notice in Acts chapter number five, we see the first example.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.980
We find that God's given us the command that we're to rejoice in the Lord all way.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.700
We find there in the book of Habakkuk that Habakkuk says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.380
Though all of those negatives that are mentioned in verse 17, yet I will rejoice.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.299
Notice in Acts chapter number five, we do not have the time this morning to develop

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:25.820
all that is taking place in Acts chapter number five, but let me say this, the disciples are

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.940
facing some real difficulty in Acts chapter number five.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.260
They have been in a position where they've been preaching the gospel after the ascension

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.579
of the Lord Jesus Christ and after the day of Pentecost and they're facing the persecution.

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:41.420
The religious leaders are not happy with the growth of the New Testament church and all

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.420
that's taking place.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.660
In fact, they tell them that they're not to speak anymore in the name of the Lord Jesus

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.579
Christ and yet when they're standing in Acts five before this religious group of leaders,

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:56.420
they say that you've filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and they're trying to figure

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.940
out what they can do to stop these individuals from continuing to preach the gospel.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.140
And after they're having this conversation and all that's taking place, we find that

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.339
Gamaliel stands up.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:13.019
He's a doctor of the law, according to verse number 34, and he gives his opinion, he gives

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:18.100
his counsel with regard to the circumstances and we find that in verse 38 it says,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.940
And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.140
For if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.380
But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest happily ye be found even to fight against

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380
God.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.419
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that we're not just, it's not my cause.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.419
It's not your cause.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.419
It's the cause of Christ.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.099
And that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:42.820
It's not a work of just men.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.260
It's the cause of Christ.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.940
And notice it says, And to him they agreed.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.739
They as the religious leaders and him as Gamaliel.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.099
And they agreed with his counsel.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.099
They agreed with what he says.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:57.700
And it says in verse 40, And when they had called the apostles, and notice these three

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:04.380
words and beaten them, and beaten them, the Bible says they commanded that they should

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.460
not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.380
And they departed from the presence of the council.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:16.099
Notice this next phrase, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:17.099
name.

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.099
You know what they were doing?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.580
They were rejoicing through trials.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.619
They were beaten, and yet they left rejoicing.

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:29.940
They were commanded, and yet the Bible says that they daily in verse 42 and in the temple

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.059
and every house, they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:39.359
The very thing that caused them to be beaten, they said, no, we're going to keep on doing

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:40.359
that.

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:41.359
Why?

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:43.359
Because we are his witnesses.

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:48.960
We find that here in Acts chapter 16, another example, we find specifically in Acts 16 that

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.320
of Paul and Silas.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.400
And again, we won't take the time to read the entire context of what's taking place,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.919
but we know that in Acts 16, they come to Philippi.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.960
The work of the Lord is going on.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.360
And we know that there was that demon-possessed girl, and we find that Paul gave command,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.960
and she… the owners, they were going to lose gain, and so they're very angry, and

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.560
they cause for Paul and Silas to be imprisoned and to be beaten.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.000
The Bible tells us in verse 22, "...until the multitude rose up together against them,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.360
and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.080
When they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.240
to keep them safely.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.560
Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made the feet

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.560
fast in the stocks…"

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:42.440
Notice verse 25, "...and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.640
and the prisoners heard them."

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.040
You know, they were still in the midst of their trial.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.420
They'd been beaten, they were still in prison, they weren't released yet.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.160
We know that they will be miraculously released as we read the text of Scripture, but even

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.840
as we'll mention tonight in the life of Joseph, we don't always know, or they didn't

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.840
always know, though we have the record of Scripture and we can read the next event,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.880
we can read what happens.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.600
Paul and Silas, they just knew that they had been beaten and they were in prison, but they

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.440
chose to rejoice through the trial.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.000
And at midnight, the Bible says that they prayed and sang praises unto God.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.080
Can you imagine rejoicing through the trials?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.320
I want you to notice with me very quickly, at the end of verse 25, it says, "...and the

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.840
prisoners heard them, and the prisoners heard them."

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.640
I would submit to you this morning, it's actually a message that I hope to develop in the future

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.000
in more detail and looking at some passages in the Old Testament as well, but I would

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.400
submit to you this morning just a thought that they were, those prisoners were going

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.080
to hear Paul and Silas regardless of what they said.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.720
They were going to hear them if they complained, and they were going to hear them if they rejoiced.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720
You know what?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720
There's some people that hear us.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
I wonder what they hear.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
What do they hear from us?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.480
When we're going through trials, when we're going through difficulties, what do they hear?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.800
What do they learn about our God as we go through trials?

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.760
As we look at 1 Peter chapter number 1 and look at verse 3 through 9 this morning, get

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.360
to our text, I believe that as we consider three truths really from this portion of Scripture

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.040
that I believe this morning will enable us to rejoice through trials.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.440
Again, I know that I will face trials.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.560
I know that you will face trials.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.880
We understand that to be the case.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.480
And what is it that God teaches us in His Word that will enable us to rejoice in the

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.940
midst of trials?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.160
The question is not, will I face a trial?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.640
The question is, how will I behave through the trial?

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.900
Notice in verse number 3 of 1 Peter 1, the Bible says, blessed be the God and Father

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.800
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.000
into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.840
incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.520
are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.840
last time.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.360
Notice in verse number 6, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.540
be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.620
precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:25.140
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ, whom, having not seen, ye

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:31.220
love, and whom, though now ye see Him not yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.660
and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.820
As we look at this portion of Scripture this morning, I believe that God gives us three

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.920
truths that will enable us, enable you, enable me, to rejoice through trials.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.340
If you're taking notes with me this morning, I would say, number one, we can rejoice through

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.240
trials because of our position in Christ.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.420
What is it that will enable me to rejoice in the midst of trials?

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.120
It's when I remember my position in Christ.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.520
Peter is writing to believers here in the book of 1 Peter.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.820
Notice in verse 1, the Bible says, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:17.440
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect according to the

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.540
foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.740
of the blood of Jesus Christ, grace unto you, and peace be multiplied.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.460
He then tells them and speaks to them in verses 3 and 4 and verse number 5 as well about their

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.060
position in Christ.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.640
I want you to understand that these believers that Peter is writing to here in 1 Peter,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.320
these are believers that are facing great difficulty.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.920
These are believers that are living during the time of the Emperor Nero's rule and reign

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.000
and what a wicked and ungodly man he was and so cruel.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.800
And we find that they're living at that particular time and they're facing great difficulties.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.720
The Bible says to the strangers scattered throughout.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720
Why were they scattered?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.420
Well, because of the persecution that was intensifying under the rule and reign of the

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.080
Emperor Nero.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.140
And we find that as these believers are being written to that God in His grace and His mercy

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:19.740
is going to help them understand truth that will enable them even in the midst of this

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.100
great difficulty, even in the midst of this trial, that they can not only rejoice but

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.820
according to verse number 6, greatly rejoice.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.180
Not only greatly rejoice, but we find that in verse number 8 that ye rejoice with joy

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.620
unspeakable and full of glory.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.940
Now there is a truth that is given to us in these first few verses of chapter number 1

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.740
that enables us to understand our position in Christ.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.380
I'm so thankful to be washed in the blood.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.000
We sang that song this morning, are you washed in the blood, and how appropriate as we think

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.120
about that song, and often I will say as we're singing the chorus of that song, when

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.240
it says are you washed in the blood, I'll say yes I am.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.960
Dean hollers out something else when he's leading it, I don't even know half the time

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.600
what he's saying, but I'm sitting here saying yes I am, amen?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.720
I am washed in the blood, and I'm so thankful that my position in Christ is settled.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.520
If you're a believer this morning, if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.000
Savior, you understood that you were a sinner, and that Christ is the only Savior, and that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.040
He offers you a gift, and that gift is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, then you

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.440
have been born again, you have been born of the Spirit, and your position in Christ is

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.760
settled, and we can rejoice in that.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.160
Listen, nobody can take your salvation.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.920
I'm thankful for that.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.880
The Bible says in John chapter number 10, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.760
I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.260
them from my hand, and we see the security of the believer.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:07.080
We see it here in 1 Peter 1 as well, but we understand this morning that there is no trial

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.800
that you can go through, there is no trial that I can go through that will alter my position

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.560
in Christ.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.760
That should cause us to rejoice.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.120
You say, but pastor, let me tell you about this trial.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.560
I'm just trying to remind you of your position in Christ.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.920
I'm trying to help you understand that yes, the trials will vary, and some are going to

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.400
be harder than others, and more intense, and maybe longer, and whatever it might be, but

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:41.840
the reality is that nothing, no trial here on earth can alter your position in Christ.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.280
So when I'm going through that trial, I remind myself I'm a child of the King.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.920
I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.800
My standing is settled, it's sure.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.760
I'm heaven-bound.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.760
All these other things are just temporary.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.440
In fact, look at it with me in verse number three.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.920
It says, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, notice it says, which

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.520
according to His abundant mercy, aren't you thankful that our God is merciful?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.920
His mercy is everlasting.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.260
His mercy is abundant.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.040
He is rich in mercy.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.840
It says that He hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.040
Christ from the dead.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.560
Listen, if Christ be not risen, then our faith is vain, and our preaching is vain, but now

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.720
is Christ risen from the dead.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.480
He is the firstfruits of them which slept, and the Bible tells us, and we understand

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.160
this morning, that I serve a risen Savior, and He lives, and how precious that is.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.200
We understand this morning because He lives because of the resurrection and my understanding

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.640
of my position in Christ.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.679
He goes on to explain it in verse number four, notice, to an inheritance incorruptible and

00:18:52.679 --> 00:19:03.160
undefiled, notice this, and fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.360
Every word of God is pure.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.440
I love the way that He explains that in verse number four.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.000
He could have just said that you have an inheritance.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.840
And by the way, that would have been sufficient because of the sufficiency of Scripture.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.480
But we find that He wanted us to really understand this inheritance that we have, that it's incorruptible,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:29.440
that it's undefiled, that it fadeth not away, that it's reserved in heaven for us.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.040
I want you to notice that phrase in verse number four where it says, fadeth not away.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.840
I want you to understand this morning that the gift of God is eternal life.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.520
Listen, I'm going to spend forever with my Savior.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.559
My position in Christ settles that because I've been born again, because I heard the

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.960
gospel and I recognized I was a sinner and He's the only Savior.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960
I was guilty.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.360
Listen, it wasn't that I was just, oh, I wasn't that bad.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.960
No, I was guilty.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.000
And by the way, if you don't recognize…

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.280
recognize that you're guilty, you're never going to recognize that you need a Savior.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:13.279
And I knew I was guilty. I was condemned. But He loved me. And He died for me. And He

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:19.000
saved me. And I'm going to heaven. And I have this inheritance. If you're saved this morning,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.399
you have this. And it says, fadeth not away. Now, I want you to keep that in mind and look

00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:27.959
at verse number six, and we'll get further into verse number six as we get through the

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:31.239
message this morning. But I want to point this out to you with regard to our position

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:36.360
in Christ. It says this, the position, the fact that we have an inheritance that fadeth

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:42.560
not away in verse number four, but then look at verse six. It says wherein ye greatly rejoice.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:49.680
Then notice this, though now for a season. Listen, I'm thankful that a season doesn't

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:58.919
define us. A season's not forever. You say, how long's a season? I don't know. I have

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:07.239
no idea. It's as long as God wants it to be. In fact, in 1 Peter chapter number 5 and verse

00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:11.040
number 10, it says, but the God of all grace, who hath caught us into His eternal glory

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:18.239
by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make ye perfect, establish, strengthen,

00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:21.559
and excel you. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. I don't know how long

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:30.680
a while is either, but I know that a season pales in comparison to fadeth not away. Amen?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.480
See, we've got to keep that eternal perspective. Sometimes in the midst of the trial, we have

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.639
that temporal perspective, and we're so focused on the season that we're not focused on the

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:48.279
eternal, on the fadeth not away. And here, these believers that are facing this great

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:52.839
persecution and all this difficulty, these trials that they're going through, Peter says

00:21:52.839 --> 00:21:57.279
to them, listen, if you're going to rejoice and if you're going to greatly rejoice through

00:21:57.279 --> 00:22:02.440
these trials, I believe that one of the truths that he shares here that will enable these

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.680
believers, that will enable you and I this morning to rejoice through trials, is that

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:14.399
we must remember our position in Christ. I'm a child of the King. Remember what Jesus said

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:20.320
in Luke chapter number 10? These fellows come back and they're rejoicing because the spirits

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.240
are in subject to them, and they're coming back and they're rejoicing over these things.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.320
And we find that in Luke chapter number 10 and verse 17, the Bible says that the 70 returned,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.919
they returned with joy. And they're talking about what happened and what transpired and

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.880
what they experienced, but Jesus says to them in Luke 10 and verse number 20, notwithstanding

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:46.660
in this and what they had experienced, he says, in this rejoice not that the spirits

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:55.639
are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. We sing

00:22:55.639 --> 00:23:02.179
that song, there's a new name written down in glory. And it's mine. Oh yes, it's mine.

00:23:02.179 --> 00:23:05.860
And we sing that song and it reminds us of the day that we trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.979
as our personal Savior. And Jesus says to these 70 that returned, they came back with

00:23:10.979 --> 00:23:16.179
joy. And Jesus says, listen, don't rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you.

00:23:16.179 --> 00:23:22.419
Rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. I'm so thankful that on, for me,

00:23:22.419 --> 00:23:28.300
August 31st, 1997, my name was written down in that book. I was born again. I was saved

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:36.979
by the grace of God. And my position in Christ allows me to rejoice through the trials.

00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:43.000
Number two, we can rejoice through trials because of God's great power. I'm thankful

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.860
for my position in Christ and I'm thankful that I serve the omnipotent God. I think about

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.839
the power of God here in verse number five, continuing really with the thought of our

00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:56.580
position in Christ and the inheritance that we have. He says, who are kept by the power

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:03.119
of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. This morning

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:08.279
I am so thankful that our God is the omnipotent God. I am thankful that I am kept by the power

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:12.440
of God. I'm thankful that there's nothing that's too hard for my God. I'm thankful this

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.279
morning that in the midst of a trial, in the midst of a difficulty, that God did not lose

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:23.079
any power. That God is not, it's not that a matter of His ability or inability. No,

00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:28.799
we find that God is able. And we find that in the midst of that trial, when we focus

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:36.399
and understand that my God has all power and my God is able, that enables me to rejoice.

00:24:36.399 --> 00:24:42.760
I think about Abraham and there in Genesis, when he's being spoken to by the Lord. And

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:50.200
Abraham is told by God that his name, one of his names is El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.559
I love that name of the Lord that he shares with Abraham there. And we find that he says,

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:01.200
my name, it's El Shaddai, I'm the Lord God Almighty. And then right after he reveals

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.519
that to him, he asks him, is there anything too hard for me? We find that Jeremiah is

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:12.440
asked a similar question as Jeremiah is prophesying on the eve of captivity. In fact, he's prophesying

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.839
and the Babylonians have already laid siege against the city. And he can see, he knows,

00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:22.320
he's the one that's been prophesying that they're going to take us captive. And then

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.839
God comes to Jeremiah and says that he's supposed to buy a piece of property, buy the field,

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:37.519
buy the field. But they're going to come and take, buy the field. And God explains to him

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.320
about the remnant that's going to return, the 70 year captivity and all that's going

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.559
to transpire and that they would dwell in that land again. And you know what? You know

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:52.239
what he understood? He understood that there's nothing too hard for God. God is all powerful.

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:55.559
Listen as we look at the examples that we looked at this morning in the book of Habakkuk

00:25:55.559 --> 00:26:00.920
and two examples in the book of Acts, they served, Habakkuk, the disciples and Paul and

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:07.760
Silas, they served the same God that we serve, the Lord God Omnipotent. He rules and he reigns.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.359
And this morning I am so thankful that his power is never lacking, that it's never a

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:16.799
situation when you're going through a trial, when I'm going through a trial, it's understood

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:22.200
that it's allowed by God. And God can change that thing at any time because he has all

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.600
power. I'm thankful to know the Omnipotent God, aren't you? I'm thankful to know the

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.239
God that said let there be light and there was light. I'm thankful that though today

00:26:34.239 --> 00:26:39.799
they're still trying to determine with some level of accuracy the total number of stars

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:44.160
and all of the things of our galaxies and what have you, and the scriptures simply say

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:51.279
and he made the stars also. This is a little thing for God because he has all power. And

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:55.760
that's your God and that's my God. When I'm in the midst of the trial, when I'm in the

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.799
midst of the difficulty and I remind myself of my position in Christ, that I'm saved by

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:07.920
the blood of the Lamb, that I'm going to heaven one day, that nothing can alter my position

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.200
in Christ, it causes me to rejoice. When I recognize and I'm reminded of the great

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.679
power of my God, that he is the Lord God Omnipotent, that he's able to do exceeding abundantly

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:25.559
above all that we ask or think, that's my God. And when I remind myself of that, I can

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:36.079
rejoice in the midst of the trial. Number three, we can rejoice through trials because

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:42.359
of God's purpose. Because of God's purpose. We see that we rejoice through trials because

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:47.600
of my position in Christ. We rejoice through trials because of God's great power. But you

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.600
and I this morning, we can rejoice through trials because of God's purpose. Let me remind

00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:00.799
you this morning that God always has purpose. He moves with purpose. And we find that God

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:05.760
is a God of purpose and everything that happens in your life and everything that happens in

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.760
my life is for a purpose. Notice in verse number six of our text of Scripture, in 1

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:18.640
Peter 1 and verse number six, the Bible says this, wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.399
for a season. Listen, your home is in heaven, you have this inheritance and your position

00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:30.880
in Christ is settled, but before you get there, you might have this trial for a season. And

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:42.719
then notice these words, if need be. If need be. Ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:49.760
As we see this phrase, if need be, in verse number six, it reminds me of God's purpose.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.479
It reminds me this morning, and it's important for each of us to understand. Listen, I believe

00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:59.919
it's imperative that we each understand this morning that God always has a purpose. If

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:06.719
need be. Who determines that? Not you and not me. God. If it were up to me, I'd never

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:13.159
need be. Amen? And if it were up to you, you probably would never need be either because

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:21.479
we just don't really like trials. But God has a purpose. God has a purpose. And there

00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:28.719
are times in your life and there are times in my life that God allows a trial and we're

00:29:28.719 --> 00:29:33.760
reminded of our position in Christ, we're reminded of God's power. Those are going to

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.960
enable us to rejoice, but when we're reminded that God has a purpose in this. This didn't

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.400
happen by accident. This was not some situation that caught God off guard. It was not a situation...

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.039
Listen, has anything ever caught you off guard? You're working, you're doing something, you

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:53.960
say, man, I didn't see that coming. I didn't expect that. It doesn't matter how well you

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.159
are at what you do. It doesn't matter how skillful you are. It doesn't matter how much

00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:00.039
you've planned and...

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:04.399
prepared and so on and so forth, there are things that might happen that you say, man,

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:09.479
I didn't plan for that. I didn't think that was going to happen. That never happens to

00:30:09.479 --> 00:30:19.479
God. God knows everything. And God does all things well. Our God is perfect.

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:24.599
In this morning when we are reminded that we can rejoice through trials because God

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:33.999
has a purpose, we find that it says, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:40.559
Notice that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:48.839
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing

00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:54.719
of Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, ye love, and whom though now ye see him not,

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:59.719
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your

00:30:59.719 --> 00:31:04.479
faith, even the salvation of your souls. I'll read also in 1 Peter 5, I read these verses

00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:11.079
a moment ago, but notice in verse 10 and 11 of 1 Peter 5, it says, but the God of all

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:16.759
grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:24.159
suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. To him be glory and

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:32.159
dominion forever and ever. Amen. From these two portions of Scripture in 1 Peter 1, verses

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:37.479
6 through 9, and in 1 Peter 5, verses 10 and 11, we really have the opportunity through

00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:44.959
these two portions of Scripture in 1 Peter to understand two purposes that God has. First

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:51.119
and foremost, I believe that God's purpose is to bring honor and glory to himself. That's

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:59.759
the primary purpose, is for God to be honored and glorified. And we find that at times God

00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:06.959
will allow a trial in your life and he'll allow a trial in my life, and as we are reminded

00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:12.159
of God's, of our position in Christ and of God's power and understanding his purpose,

00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:16.359
and we understand that through this God is to be honored and glorified. I may not see

00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:20.719
at the start of the trial exactly how it is that God's going to be honored and glorified,

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:26.359
but I can understand and I can rest assured that God has a purpose in the midst of that

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:33.879
trial. And I'm so thankful that God in the midst of the trial is to be honored and glorified.

00:32:33.879 --> 00:32:37.439
Notice if you will, take your Bibles and turn back to the book of John if you will, and

00:32:37.439 --> 00:32:44.119
I want to show you a thought here in John chapter number 11, and I want you to see,

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:49.879
I'm in Luke, I better get over to John, I went too far. In John chapter number 11, it's

00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:55.719
a familiar passage of Scripture. The Bible tells us in John chapter 11 that near the

00:32:55.719 --> 00:33:00.799
end of the passage that Jesus stands and says, Lazarus, come forth. And we all know what

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:06.159
happens in this portion of Scripture. Lazarus comes walking out of the grave. He was dead

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:14.679
for four days, and the concern was that he surely stinketh by now. But we find at the

00:33:14.679 --> 00:33:20.679
very beginning of this passage of Scripture in John chapter 11 that Lazarus falls sick,

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:26.879
and Mary and Martha, they believed not only that the Lord Jesus Christ loved their brother,

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:31.079
but I believe that they, and you study through the passage of Scripture, they believed that

00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:37.039
Jesus had the ability to heal Lazarus of whatever the sickness was. In fact, they both

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:44.239
protest when Jesus arrives that if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. Not only

00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:48.319
did Mary and Martha believe that, but I would say to you that the Jews that were gathered

00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:54.279
together that were wailing and that were mourning with the family, that they also say in verse

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:58.439
number 37, could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even

00:33:58.439 --> 00:34:04.679
this man should not have died? They believe. Listen, the account in John chapter 10 of

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:09.319
the pool of Bethesda and the eyes being open, I mean, that's an amazing truth that is given

00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:14.999
to us, and we find that there as we look at what's happening and looking at that context

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:20.279
that now, John chapter number 9, excuse me, we find that there this man that was born

00:34:20.279 --> 00:34:25.679
blind, he was blind from his birth, that these Jews, they say, could not this man that healed

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:33.159
that man that was blind, could not, he could have healed this man. And so Mary and Martha

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:40.439
believe that Jesus was able, and therefore they send for him. Now, we believe that Jesus

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:46.759
is able, so what do we do? We pray. Jesus is not here physically with us as he was in

00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:51.759
John chapter 11, the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, when he took on the form

00:34:51.759 --> 00:34:57.559
of a man, he never ceased being God, he's the God-man, and we find that at the incarnation

00:34:57.559 --> 00:35:02.079
he comes in this ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ's earthly ministry in John chapter

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:09.839
11, we find that they were able to send physically for Jesus to come. Jesus is not here physically

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:14.479
anymore. We understand that we have the Holy Spirit of God that indwells us, we understand

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:18.239
the Bible says that he ascended to heaven, and one day, one glorious day, he's coming

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:23.339
back for us and how we should rejoice in that, but he's at the right hand of the Father,

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:29.799
he ever liveth, the Bible says, to make intercession for us. And we cannot go call for Jesus that

00:35:29.799 --> 00:35:34.599
he's down at the, the, the wherever he is and bring him here physically like they could,

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:40.039
but we pray. Why do we pray? Well, because we believe that Jesus is able. But when Jesus

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:48.919
finds out about he whom thou lovest is sick, Jesus didn't immediately go. He tarried because

00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:54.999
he had a purpose. Notice in verse number 4 of John 11, the Bible says when Jesus heard

00:35:54.999 --> 00:36:02.039
that, heard what? That Lazarus was sick, he said, the sickness is not unto death, but

00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:09.399
then notice these words, but for the glory of God, but for the glory of God, that the

00:36:09.399 --> 00:36:15.319
Son of God might be glorified thereby. Listen, in your life and in my life, we go through

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:20.439
trials. One of the purposes that God has is that he would receive the honor and glory.

00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:26.599
You say, man, this trial is just, it's just overwhelming and I can't, how's God going

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:32.759
to get glory through it? If we're complaining and murmuring and we're just kind of, it's

00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:37.719
going to make it pretty tough. But when we understand that he has a purpose, we say,

00:36:37.719 --> 00:36:41.479
God, I'm not sure what you're doing here, but I know that you do all things well. I

00:36:41.479 --> 00:36:45.879
know, God, that you make no mistakes. God, I know that you have a purpose in this. And

00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:51.399
God, I pray that through this somehow you would receive the honor and the glory, that

00:36:51.399 --> 00:37:01.879
your name would be exalted, that you would be magnified through this trial. Not only

00:37:01.879 --> 00:37:05.079
is he seeking to bring honor and glory to himself, but he's seeking to develop you and

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:14.919
I spiritually. He's seeking to develop us spiritually. You know, growth has challenges.

00:37:14.919 --> 00:37:18.799
You ever hear somebody speak medically about physical growth and they talk about growing

00:37:18.799 --> 00:37:24.719
pains? You ever hear somebody use that phraseology? My brother, he grew about six inches one summer

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:30.079
and he had terrible pain in his knees for several months because of what the doctor

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:34.639
said is that he grew so fast that all those ligaments and what have you were stretched

00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:37.719
out and it was just causing him pain. And they said, just bear with it for a little

00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:42.359
while and it will go away. And eventually that kind of happened. But you hear that thing

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:45.919
of growing pains. Listen, when you grow, if you want to go work out, I was working out

00:37:45.919 --> 00:37:49.599
with Joseph and he's at that age where he wants to start lifting weights and so I'm

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:53.159
lifting weights with Joseph. And guess what happens after you lift weights when you haven't

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:58.559
done it for a while? You're sore. And so you know what Joseph likes to do, Tim? He likes

00:37:58.559 --> 00:38:02.519
to come over to me and he likes to do this right here. How's that feel, daddy? How's

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:06.319
this feel, daddy? Why? Because he knows that that's sore because of the muscles that we

00:38:06.319 --> 00:38:15.439
worked. It's just how it works. Sometimes the growth spiritually requires a trial. But

00:38:15.439 --> 00:38:20.199
God's developing us. You say, but I don't want that pain. I don't want that. But God's

00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:25.839
growing you. You're going to learn something that you would not learn under any other circumstance.

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:33.599
Notice here in John 11, after Jesus delays, he tells the disciples that we're going to

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:39.440
go. And he says in verse number 11, these things said he, and after that he saith unto

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.119
them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may wake him out of sleep. Then said

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:49.519
his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death,

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:54.119
but they thought that he had spoken of taking a rest and sleep. Then said Jesus unto them

00:38:54.119 --> 00:39:02.199
plainly, Lazarus is dead. But then I want you to catch verse 15. Jesus says this, I

00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:13.679
am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe. Nevertheless,

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:21.839
let us go unto him. He says, I am glad for your sakes that I was not there. Listen, there's

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:26.719
some things that God's going to teach us in the midst of trials that we're only going

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:33.599
to learn through the trial. It's just the way it works. Some of you do various things

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:40.239
for a living that require certain types of training. And there are times in which you

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:46.599
engage in training that you hope you never have to use. But you learn some things through

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:53.599
that process. And God, as he's bringing, as he's allowing trials in your life and in my

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:59.119
life, I am able to rejoice. I'm able to have joy unspeakable and full of glory. I'm able

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:00.079
to rejoice greatly.

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:02.579
in the midst of the trial, why?

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:05.479
Because I understand my position in Christ.

00:40:05.479 --> 00:40:07.559
This trial that I'm going through

00:40:07.559 --> 00:40:10.799
is not going to change my position in Christ.

00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:12.719
It's not gonna alter it one bit.

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:15.559
It's not gonna change that I'm going to heaven one day.

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:17.119
This trial that I'm going through,

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:19.239
I know that my God has all power,

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.819
and I know that my God is able,

00:40:20.819 --> 00:40:23.279
and I know that he is able to do something amazing,

00:40:23.279 --> 00:40:25.759
and I trust him, and I'm following him,

00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:28.519
and I'm rejoicing because it's kind of that idea

00:40:28.519 --> 00:40:31.879
of anticipating and expecting what's God going to do.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:34.839
You remember the disciples when they're

00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:37.339
in the midst of the storm on the boat?

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:38.919
By the way, they were in the midst of the storm

00:40:38.919 --> 00:40:41.639
because Jesus told them, go to the other side.

00:40:43.879 --> 00:40:47.059
This idea this morning that trials are always,

00:40:47.059 --> 00:40:49.319
100% of the time, a result of your sin

00:40:49.319 --> 00:40:51.799
or my sin is not biblical.

00:40:51.799 --> 00:40:53.759
Now there are some times that,

00:40:53.759 --> 00:40:54.999
the way of the transgressor is hard.

00:40:54.999 --> 00:40:56.759
There are some times that sin results

00:40:56.759 --> 00:40:58.919
in some hardship and some difficulty,

00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:00.719
but I would submit to you this morning

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:02.559
that there are times in which you,

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:04.999
there are times that I may be right in the midst

00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:08.639
of a great storm of a trial simply because I'm obeying God,

00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:12.639
simply because I'm following the leadership

00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:14.319
of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:17.839
and I find myself in the midst of a trial.

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:20.399
Such was the case for the disciples on that day,

00:41:20.399 --> 00:41:22.759
and they find themselves in the midst of a great storm,

00:41:22.759 --> 00:41:25.879
and Jesus then says, peace be still, and the storm is calm.

00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:27.959
They got to see the power.

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.519
What manner of man is this

00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:34.079
that even the winds and the waves obey him?

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:35.439
They get to learn some things.

00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:36.719
Listen, if there was never a storm,

00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:39.319
they never would have seen that power.

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:40.399
If there was never a storm,

00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:42.639
you would never be able to read the account.

00:41:42.639 --> 00:41:44.879
I'd never be able to preach or teach the account

00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:48.279
of Jesus demonstrating his power over the storm.

00:41:49.199 --> 00:41:50.899
They needed to go through a storm.

00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:55.899
This morning, God has a purpose.

00:41:57.339 --> 00:41:59.979
His purpose, first and foremost,

00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:02.339
is to bring honor and glory to himself.

00:42:02.339 --> 00:42:04.939
Secondly, it's to develop us spiritually.

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:07.419
Notice, it says that the trial of your faith

00:42:07.419 --> 00:42:08.739
in 1 Peter 1 and verse number seven,

00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:12.099
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth.

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:13.999
That'll put some things in perspective

00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:18.139
as to what is important and what's the priority.

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:22.659
He says, though it be tried with fire,

00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:24.899
might be found in the praise and honor and glory

00:42:24.899 --> 00:42:26.339
at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:28.899
Listen, one day, he's coming back.

00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:29.819
One day, I'm going to see him.

00:42:29.819 --> 00:42:34.299
We sang last week, face to face, I shall behold him.

00:42:34.299 --> 00:42:36.099
One day, I'm going to see my savior.

00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:39.099
Man, that should encourage every single believer

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:40.859
this morning, I'm going to see him.

00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:45.619
We find, it says that we can have this joy,

00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:46.979
unspeakable and full of glory

00:42:46.979 --> 00:42:48.739
in 1 Peter 5 and verse 10.

00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:50.259
It says that after you've suffered a while,

00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:52.059
that he will make you perfect,

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:55.059
establish, strengthen, and settle you.

00:42:55.059 --> 00:42:56.299
I want you to think about that work

00:42:56.299 --> 00:42:57.939
that God's doing through the trial

00:42:57.939 --> 00:43:00.539
and developing us spiritually.

00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:02.979
No doubt that we could stand here this morning

00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:04.259
and we could give testimonies.

00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:05.899
We could open up for opportunity

00:43:05.899 --> 00:43:08.179
for some to give some testimonies this morning

00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:11.059
of, listen, how has God taught you certain things?

00:43:11.059 --> 00:43:13.059
How has God grown you spiritually?

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:16.139
And I can guarantee you that there will be some trials

00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:19.419
that are referenced as to how God developed us.

00:43:23.779 --> 00:43:26.979
Job said it this way in Job 23.

00:43:33.259 --> 00:43:36.499
Verse number 10, but he knoweth the way that I take.

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:42.539
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:44.059
As gold.

00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:47.859
I want you to think about Job just for a moment.

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:51.339
You say, man, I had a bad day.

00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:52.299
Read Job.

00:43:55.939 --> 00:43:57.139
Seriously.

00:43:57.139 --> 00:43:59.019
How many of you have read Job before?

00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:01.659
Okay.

00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:03.299
If you've read Job,

00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:08.939
I'm guessing that you've never had a day like Job had.

00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:18.539
And Job says, he knoweth the way that I take.

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:24.179
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

00:44:25.979 --> 00:44:27.619
Ron Hamilton wrote a song

00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:31.059
that goes along with this verse of Scripture.

00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:34.619
Man, what a powerful truth.

00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:38.099
James says it this way, and we'll close with this

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:41.619
in James one, verses two through four.

00:44:43.539 --> 00:44:46.099
Notice here,

00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:54.819
James says, my brethren, count it all joy

00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:58.299
when you fall into divers temptations.

00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:02.539
Rejoicing through trials.

00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:04.859
Count it all joy.

00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:08.179
Temptations, trials, divers, various sorts.

00:45:09.179 --> 00:45:11.299
Then notice these two words,

00:45:11.299 --> 00:45:12.819
and I think they're so important.

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:15.059
Knowing this.

00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:19.499
There's some things that God wants his people to know.

00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:24.499
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith

00:45:24.499 --> 00:45:29.499
worketh patience, but let patience have her perfect work,

00:45:30.419 --> 00:45:35.419
that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

00:45:38.419 --> 00:45:42.619
That's maturity, Christian maturity, perfect.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:47.619
Not sinless, but complete, that idea of maturity.

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:53.699
And it says that knowing this, this morning,

00:45:53.779 --> 00:45:56.219
the question is not whether you'll have a trial.

00:45:57.419 --> 00:45:58.899
The question really for us this morning

00:45:58.899 --> 00:46:02.139
is how do we respond in the midst of the trial?

00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:07.139
Can we rejoice through trials?

00:46:09.779 --> 00:46:11.779
We're commanded to do so.

00:46:11.779 --> 00:46:15.419
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.

00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:17.779
This is the day the Lord hath made.

00:46:17.779 --> 00:46:21.099
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:46:22.019 --> 00:46:24.779
We can see some people in the pages of scripture,

00:46:24.779 --> 00:46:26.939
I've just looked at three references this morning,

00:46:26.939 --> 00:46:30.099
that face great difficulty, and yet they rejoiced.

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:36.059
So absolutely we can rejoice through trials.

00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:38.219
This is not an exhaustive list this morning,

00:46:38.219 --> 00:46:41.779
but from 1 Peter 1, just three simple thoughts,

00:46:41.779 --> 00:46:46.099
truths that will enable you, that will enable me

00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:48.899
to rejoice in the midst of trial.

00:46:48.899 --> 00:46:52.499
Number one, remember your position in Christ.

00:46:52.499 --> 00:46:55.739
What a joy to be saved, what a joy.

00:46:55.739 --> 00:47:00.739
No man, no thing can alter your position in Christ.

00:47:02.299 --> 00:47:05.459
Remember the power of God in the midst of your trial.

00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:06.819
Remember God's power.

00:47:06.819 --> 00:47:08.739
We serve the Lord God omnipotent.

00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:10.459
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above

00:47:10.459 --> 00:47:12.579
all that we ask or think.

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:13.539
And then finally this morning,

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:15.819
remember that God has a purpose.

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:17.699
It's never by accident.

00:47:17.699 --> 00:47:19.599
It's never for naught.

00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:22.899
It's not just an exercise to,

00:47:22.899 --> 00:47:24.159
well we got nothing else to do today,

00:47:24.159 --> 00:47:25.319
so we're just gonna have you do this.

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:27.519
It's not busy work, it's not, no, no, no.

00:47:27.519 --> 00:47:28.599
There's a purpose.

00:47:30.439 --> 00:47:33.199
First and foremost, that God will be glorified.

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:35.319
And secondly, that we'd be developed,

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:37.319
that we'd grow spiritually,

00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:41.339
that we'd come to that place of spiritual maturity.

00:47:42.439 --> 00:47:46.199
Trials, rejoicing through trials.

00:47:46.199 --> 00:47:47.039
Let's pray.

00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:48.079
Father, we love you.

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.759
We thank you for loving us.

00:47:49.759 --> 00:47:51.839
We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:54.119
this morning to gather together.

00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:57.519
We thank you for the word of God.

00:47:57.519 --> 00:47:58.979
We thank you for the truth.

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:04.279
God, I know that I will face trials.

00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:06.159
I know that each one that sits here this morning

00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:07.439
will face trials.

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:11.659
And God, I pray that you would enable us

00:48:11.659 --> 00:48:13.039
to rejoice through trials,

00:48:13.039 --> 00:48:15.879
that these three truths from 1 Peter 1

00:48:15.879 --> 00:48:18.359
would just permeate our minds,

00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:21.439
that we'd be reminded in the midst of trial

00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:24.479
of our position in Christ,

00:48:24.479 --> 00:48:27.959
of your great power and of your purpose.

00:48:27.959 --> 00:48:29.439
Lord, maybe this morning there's some

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:33.879
that are just going through trials, difficulties.

00:48:33.879 --> 00:48:36.599
Lord, I pray that you'd help them this morning.

00:48:36.599 --> 00:48:38.639
Lord, for one that says, man, I have nothing,

00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:39.599
no trial right now.

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:42.279
God, help them to store this

00:48:42.279 --> 00:48:47.279
and to be ready to return to it when that trial does come.

00:48:48.199 --> 00:48:51.679
Lord, that you'd help us to rejoice through trials.

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:53.119
There's one that's not sure of heaven,

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:53.999
they've never been saved.

00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:55.959
Lord, I pray that today they'd be saved

00:48:57.179 --> 00:49:00.399
so they'd know that position that they have in Christ.

00:49:00.399 --> 00:49:02.519
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:04.599
and we'll give you the glory for it.

00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:05.719
It's in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:05.719 --> 00:49:06.559
Would you stand with me?

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:07.399
Heads or backs?
