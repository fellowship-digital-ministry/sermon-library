1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
and this is our final message from our study throughout the year. Our theme of

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,600
course for 2020 looking unto Jesus and what a blessing as we've studied through

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,079
the book of Hebrews I trust that it's been a tremendous blessing to you as it

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,840
has been for me and it is certainly a little unusual this year it's the 29th

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,639
of November and we're finishing up the book in which I've been preaching

6
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,760
through on Sunday mornings and typically it's in December when I'm kind of

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,400
rushing along to try to finish up and so a little different of a feeling this

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,119
year and so I trust to be a blessing to you last week we looked at Hebrews 13

9
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:46,080
verses 7 through 17 and as we studied that portion of this chapter we were

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,240
confronted with the importance of praise of course we understand throughout the

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,880
Word of God that we have been instructed we have been given many examples of the

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,319
importance of praising the Lord and rejoicing greatly and we have many

13
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:04,239
reasons to rejoice we serve a wonderful God who is good all of the time and he

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,760
has revealed himself to us in his precious Word and what a blessing it is

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,080
of course as we read through the Psalms even as I mentioned last week we have

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,279
many opportunities to read and to be confronted with the rejoicing of the

17
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:22,239
psalmist and how encouraging it is to read through the book of Psalms and to

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,120
read the individual Psalms and to see how the the psalmist is rejoicing

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,919
greatly and he's declared even as I mentioned on Sunday evening last week a

20
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:39,879
number of times he declared that I will rejoice I will sing praise and we need

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,000
to have that same perspective in verse number 15 of Hebrews 13 the Bible says

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,480
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,000
that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name last week I preached

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,639
the message our lips giving thanks to his name part one today is part two our

25
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,639
lips giving thanks to his name as we looked at this passage and really as I

26
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:10,039
began to just meditate upon and I believe that the Lord has revealed ten

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,479
reasons in the last section of Hebrews 13 in verses 7 down through verse number

28
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,080
25 ten reasons that we ought to rejoice now we understand that the list that is

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,000
provided here or the ten things that you find within the verses here it's not an

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,839
exhaustive list in any way shape or form the songwriter got it right when he

31
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:34,039
said name your count your blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you

32
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,639
what the Lord hath done and the psalmist said that the Lord daily loadeth us with

33
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,399
benefits and we agree with that because we look at this passage of scripture we

34
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:48,559
find there are ten reasons to rejoice that these believers are being reminded

35
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:53,199
of these reasons to rejoice last week just very quickly to look at the first

36
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,759
five that we dealt with last week we saw number one we ought to rejoice for

37
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,479
spiritual leaders what a blessing that God has designed it that he has called

38
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:08,559
and equipped spiritual leaders and how they have influenced us I know I

39
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:13,880
mentioned last week how that there have been some in my life that have made a

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,199
great impact for which I am so thankful and even still to this day I am thankful

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,039
for the influence and the impact that those spiritual leaders had in my life

42
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,720
for their faithfulness some of them are still serving the Lord faithfully today

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,399
some of them are with the Lord and that is a tremendous blessing not only that

44
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:36,839
we should rejoice in spiritual leaders the immutability of the Lord notice in

45
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:40,559
verse number eight Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and we

46
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:44,440
spoke about the fact that our God is immutable he never changes and that

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,320
ought to cause us to rejoice we said that we ought to rejoice for the Word of

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,039
God I'm so thankful that God has given us his precious word we understand that

49
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,880
it's profitable that it is just a precious book and God has given it to us

50
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,559
so that we might be sound in our doctrine so that we might have our

51
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:07,199
hearts established so that we would not be tossed to and fro with every wind of

52
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,479
doctrine and I'm so thankful that God's given us his word the substitutionary

53
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,160
atonement of Christ and so thankful that Christ took my place that he paid the

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,600
price for my sin and for your sin and for the sin of the world and then we

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,480
finished up last week with number five our home in heaven and what a joy to

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,239
think about the the certainty of heaven the reality of heaven I read and I think

57
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,640
about the Apostle Paul and his perspective and often as he shares as

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,079
he's ministering to these churches that God gave him the opportunity to minister

59
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,480
to in these believers and he speaks about his desire to going and being with

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,959
the Lord to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord and he

61
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,200
mentions many things of course we have the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,000
himself and what a joy to know the certainty the reality of heaven this

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,119
morning as we finish up the passage of Scripture we'll look at at least five

64
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:03,359
more reasons here that we ought to rejoice begin looking in verse number

65
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,640
18 the Bible says pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience and all

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,480
things willing to live honestly but I beseech you the rather to do this that I

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,559
may be restored to you the sooner now the God of peace that brought again from

68
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:21,079
the dead our Lord Jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood

69
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,000
of the everlasting covenant make you perfect and every good work to do his

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,040

Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen and I beseech you brethren suffer

72

the word of exhortation for I've written a letter unto you in few words know ye

75

they have Italy salute you grace be with you all amen as we look at this past

76
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,519
description I'm gonna I know it would be number six if you're continuing with

77
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,619
your notes from last week but I'm gonna just number on one through five again

78
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,279
this morning some weren't here last week didn't hear the first part of the

79
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,559
message and so this morning for part two of our lips giving thanks to his name

80
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:14,160
let me share with it with you this number one this morning the privilege of

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,200
prayer we ought to thank God for the privilege of prayer I notice in verse

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,679
number 18 the verse begins by saying these three simple words that no doubt

83
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:27,079
you have you have said these words you have heard people say these words when

84
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:33,640
the when the the writer says pray for us pray for us now I think about that and I

85
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,040
begin to meditate upon that just the thought of verse number 18 those first

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,959
three words and I think about the privilege of prayer that we have as the

87
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,440
children of God you understand this morning that prayer is a unique

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,079
privilege to the child of God I hear sometimes there are people in the world

89
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,040
that do not know the Lord they're not saved and of course our desire is to see

90
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,239
them saved and maybe they'll say something like this I'm thinking about

91
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:03,760
you my thoughts are with you but when we understand this morning that as a child

92
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,040
of God we have the unique privilege to enter into the very presence of the God

93
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,559
of the universe and seek his face in prayer it is amazing to think about the

94
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:19,359
privilege of prayer and this morning is the writer says pray for us and I'm

95
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:25,440
mindful of the recipients receiving this simple instruction that that they're to

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,480
pray one for another and as we engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer what

97
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,440
a blessing it is I'm sure that you've heard someone say to you at some point

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,200
I'll pray for you or I will be praying for you maybe you've even mentioned

99
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,279
those words and I wonder this morning those words are so easy for us to speak

100
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,880
but I wonder how often we really sit back and really grasp the significance

101
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,600
of prayer and the the privilege of prayer this morning I'm mindful of what

102
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,799
the disciples said to the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 11 in verse number one

103
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:06,839
when they said Lord teach us to pray teach us to pray I'm mindful of what

104
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,320
James says in James 5 in verse number 16 the latter part of the verse the

105
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,959
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much of course even here in

106
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,519
the book of Hebrews in chapter number 4 and verse number 16 let us therefore

107
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,799
come boldly under the thorn of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace

108
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:30,399
to help in time of need I'm mindful of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians

109
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,000
on two occasions in the book he writes to the believers in Ephesus and shares

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,520
with them that he's praying for them but he doesn't just say I'm praying for you

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,919
he tells them how he's praying for them we find this also in the book of

112
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,320
Colossians in the first chapter of the book of Colossians you find how that

113
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,020
Paul is praying for believers he's not even met he's just heard about their

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,500
faith he did not minister in Colossae but yet Paul is praying for those

115
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,799
believers in Colossae and he lets them know I'm praying for you and here's how

116
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,739
I'm praying for you it's very interesting that in the book of

117
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:07,380
Philippians as you look at the first chapter in fact why don't you turn there

118
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,700
the book of Philippians and notice what Paul says to these believers in Philippi

119
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,179
he says this to them in verse number three I thank my God upon every

120
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:24,340
remembrance of you and then he goes on to say this to these believers in verse

121
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:31,460
number four of Philippians 1 always in every prayer of mine for you all making

122
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,580
requests with joy I want you to notice a phrase in verse number seven when Paul

123
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,299
says this even as a meat for me to think this of you all look look what he says

124
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:45,979
because I have you in my heart he has them in their heart he's thinking about

125
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,580
them he says I'm thanking God upon every remembrance of you in verse number three

126
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,580
and then he tells them how he's praying for them in verse number four always in

127
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,059
every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy

128
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,639
And I think about this privilege of prayer.

129
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,539
Not only does Paul share with those that he's writing to,

130
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,179
that he's ministering to, how that he's praying for them,

131
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,979
but you understand that even as we find here in Hebrews 13,

132
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:18,299
in verse number 18, how the Bible tells us, pray for us,

133
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,739
that Paul makes that request

134
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,539
to the believers at Ephesus as well.

135
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,059
In Ephesians chapter number six,

136
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,699
after he goes through the armor of God

137
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,379
and put on the whole armor of God,

138
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,979
and he talks about the importance of prayer,

139
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,339
but then he says, pray for me,

140
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,339
that I may speak the word with boldness.

141
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,339
And you look at how he's requesting that they pray

142
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,219
in Colossians chapter number four.

143
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,739
In chapter one, Paul tells the believers in Colossae,

144
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,979
I'm praying for you, but in chapter number four,

145
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:46,939
he says, pray for me, pray for us.

146
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,459
And as we think about this unique privilege of prayer,

147
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,699
I hope this morning that we really just take a moment

148
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:59,459
and just thank God for the opportunity to pray.

149
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,219
And that not only would we thank God

150
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,819
for the opportunity to pray,

151
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,419
but that we would spend time in prayer,

152
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,339
that we would not just understand the principle of prayer

153
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,979
and the privilege of prayer,

154
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,819
but that we'd actually practice,

155
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:18,220
that we'd actually engage in prayer as a child of God,

156
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,699
that we would pray one for another.

157
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:24,259
Paul says this in 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

158
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,659
brethren, pray for us, pray for us.

159
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,979
I got a phone call this morning.

160
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,899
It was very interesting.

161
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,579
I came to church early this morning.

162
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,299
And as I was sitting in my office, the phone rang.

163
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,939
And typically I would not be in my office

164
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,500
at that hour on a Sunday morning,

165
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,540
but I happened to be here this morning and the phone rang.

166
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,979
I did not recognize the number.

167
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,779
And I went to pick up the phone,

168
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,439
which is something, again, I normally wouldn't be there.

169
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,059
But even if I am in my office,

170
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,579
a lot of times I don't answer on Sunday morning

171
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,979
unless I know who it is.

172
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,739
And so I answered the phone anyway.

173
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,739
And I, good morning, Fellowship Baptist Church.

174
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:03,180
And the person on the other end of the phone said,

175
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,540
this is a church.

176
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,379
And I said, it is.

177
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,579
They said, I thought I was calling.

178
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,299
And they mentioned who they thought they were calling.

179
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,419
And I know who that person is.

180
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:13,139
And it's actually a missionary that we support.

181
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,679
And I said, well, we support that missionary.

182
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,819
I'm aware of that missionary family,

183
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,339
but this is not their sending church.

184
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,380
It's not their home church.

185
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,339
And they're not here today.

186
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,059
And he said, I was just calling

187
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,599
to let them know I'm praying for them.

188
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,360
I just wanted to let them know this morning

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,239
that I was praying for them.

190
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,179
Is there any way that you can get a message

191
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,559
to this missionary and let them know I'm praying for them?

192
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,639
And I hung up that phone and I got on my computer

193
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,720
and I sent an email to the missionary.

194
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,800
I said, I just wanted to let you know

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,239
that so-and-so called this morning.

196
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,599
I don't know who so-and-so is.

197
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,959
I've never met them before.

198
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,720
I have no idea who they are.

199
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,080
They live in a completely different state.

200
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,000
But I sent an email to the other side of the world

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,440
and said, this fella called our church this morning

202
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,160
and he wants you to know that he's praying for you.

203
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,319
I can only imagine that when that missionary

204
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,880
opens the email, now they're ahead of us in time

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,360
and so it will be later in the day for them,

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
in the evening, I can only imagine

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,319
that when he opened that email that he was encouraged.

208
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,080
Because I know that when someone tells you

209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,919
that they're praying for you,

210
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,199
I know that when someone sends you a card

211
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,839
and lets you know that they're praying for you,

212
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,559
when somebody sends you that message

213
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
and says I'm praying for you,

214
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,239
I know how that impacts us.

215
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,839
It's a unique privilege of a child of God.

216
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,639
And we notice here it says pray for us

217
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
for we trust we have a good conscience

218
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
in all things, willing to live honestly.

219
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
I beseech you the rather to do this

220
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,399
that I may be restored to you the sooner.

221
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,839
And as we notice here again

222
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,080
in focusing in upon these reasons to rejoice,

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,919
I wonder this morning how often do we really stop

224
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,279
and just thank God for the privilege of prayer?

225
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,839
Thank you that I can enter into your presence

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
and commune with you.

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,239
It's an amazing opportunity.

228
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,399
Number two in our notes,

229
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,880
if you're looking here as we continue to move forward,

230
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,360
I want you to rejoice in this reality

231
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,479
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

232
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,360
In verse number 20, the Bible says this,

233
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,520
now the God of peace,

234
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,080
notice what it says that brought again

235
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,319
from the dead our Lord Jesus,

236
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,199
that great shepherd of the sheep

237
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
through the blood of the everlasting covenant.

238
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,959
I'm so thankful that he is the great shepherd.

239
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,600
And we've spoken often about the reality

240
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
that the Lord is my shepherd

241
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,480
as the Psalmist would say in Psalm 23.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,160
And what a great truth that is.

243
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,679
And we're so thankful for it.

244
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,959
But as we look at verse number 20

245
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,119
and we focus upon the reality of the resurrection

246
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,040
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

247
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
We spoke as we looked at the first section

248
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,079
of this last portion of Hebrews 13,

249
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,600
and we spoke about the substitutionary atonement

250
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,839
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

251
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,760
And I'm thankful that he went to that cross of Calvary,

252
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,639
that he shed his precious blood.

253
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,160
And we understand biblically

254
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
that he was buried in a borrowed tomb,

255
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,600
but he rose in victory,

256
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,279
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

257
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,919
We often speak about the fact

258
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,679
that we serve a risen Savior and we do.

259
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,399
And how we ought to rejoice.

260
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,679
And listen, the reality of the resurrection

261
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,600
is not just reserved for the springtime

262
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
around the Easter holiday.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,279
It is the cornerstone of our faith.

264
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,040
Paul says that if Christ be not risen,

265
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
then our faith and our preaching, they're vain.

266
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
And we notice, if you turn over to Matthew 28,

267
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,239
notice here the account that is given,

268
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,799
and I hope that it never bores you

269
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,320
to read about the record of the resurrection

270
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
of our wonderful Savior.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,880
And we think about the significance.

272
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Remember, Jesus had said that he would rise from the dead.

273
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,799
The disciples did not always understand

274
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,119
what he was speaking of.

275
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:47,440
They did not grasp the significance

276
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,399
of the instruction in which he would give them.

277
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,959
But we find that after the burial,

278
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,160
as it's recorded in chapter 27,

279
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,320
in verse number one of chapter 28,

280
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,919
the Bible says, in the end of the Sabbath,

281
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,679
as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,

282
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,519
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

283
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,079
to see the sepulcher.

284
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,919
And behold, there was a great earthquake.

285
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,919
For the angel of the Lord descended from heaven

286
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,000
and came and rolled back the stone from the door

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,320
and sat upon it.

288
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,399
His countenance was like lightning.

289
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,119
His raiment white as snow.

290
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,679
And for fear of him, the keepers did shake

291
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,760
and became as dead men.

292
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,239
The angel answered and said unto the women,

293
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:30,279
fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus,

294
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,119
which was crucified.

295
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:36,239
He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.

296
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,079
Come, see the place where the Lord lay,

297
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,320
and go quickly and tell his disciples

298
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,919
that he is risen from the dead.

299
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,760
And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee.

300
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,399
There shall ye see him.

301
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,600
Lo, I have told you."

302
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,239
What a blessing to think about the resurrection

303
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,480
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

304
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,279
We could reference the entirety

305
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,440
of 1 Corinthians 15 this morning

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,119
and understand that that chapter

307
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,839
is the great resurrection chapter

308
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,320
of all of the Word of God.

309
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
And you read through the 15th chapter

310
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
of the book of 1 Corinthians

311
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,839
and you see the significance of the teaching

312
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,239
of the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

313
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,839
Paul said this to Timothy.

314
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,119
He says this in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number eight,

315
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,679
remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David

316
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,399
was raised from the dead according to my gospel.

317
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,119
It's a good thing for us to remember

318
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,919
that we serve a risen Savior.

319
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,760
It's a good thing for us to be mindful

320
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,760
of the fact that he conquered sin, death, and the grave,

321
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,760
and that he lives forevermore.

322
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,919
It's interesting if you read the book of Revelation

323
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,200
and really in the first few chapters,

324
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,239
you find that as those letters

325
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,720
are being sent to the churches in Asia

326
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,919
and the way in which the significance

327
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,639
of these letters in Jesus as he's speaking to John

328
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,480
and giving the content of these letters,

329
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,399
he speaks about the fact that he was crucified,

330
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:04,559
but he now lives and he lives forevermore.

331
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,200
And this morning, it ought to be a great influence

332
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,679
and a great impact in our lives

333
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,200
that we serve a risen Savior,

334
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,440
and we ought to thank him for it.

335
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
Listen, we ought to rejoice that we serve a risen Savior.

336
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,760
I mentioned last week how that as we looked

337
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,239
at those first five reasons to rejoice from Hebrews 13,

338
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,320
that these are reasons in which are really unchanging.

339
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,799
There's no one that's gonna change these reasons

340
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,919
that we have to rejoice.

341
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,559
You understand this morning that you could be flat

342
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,479
on your back in some place, maybe imprisoned

343
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,479
or in a hospital or wherever it is, and you can still pray.

344
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,279
They can't keep you from praying.

345
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,559
See, it's a reason to rejoice.

346
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,880
I can pray.

347
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Call unto me, God told Jeremiah,

348
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,159
and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things

349
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,159
which thou knowest not.

350
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,719
Listen, no one's gonna change the fact

351
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,760
that Christ rose from the dead.

352
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,039
It's a settled fact of history.

353
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,520
He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

354
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,159
As much as they tried to keep him from raising from the dead,

355
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,159
as much as they went to Pilate and they said,

356
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,599
as much as they went to Pilate and they said,

357
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,960
listen, we know that he said that he was gonna rise,

358
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,719
and so we need to make this tomb as sure as we can,

359
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,719
and he said, go ahead, you go and you set a watch

360
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,359
and you make it as sure as you can,

361
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,599
but there was nothing that could keep our Savior

362
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,840
from rising and conquering sin, death, and the grave.

363
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,799
This morning, we have reasons to rejoice

364
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,840
that I understand things around us are changing.

365
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,719
I understand that circumstances can be difficult,

366
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:34,479
but when we're mindful of the fact that we can pray,

367
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:37,140
we're mindful of the fact that we serve a risen Savior,

368
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,520
we have reason to rejoice,

369
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,760
and we know that we're to give thanks always for all things.

370
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,080
We understand that in everything,

371
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,679
give thanks for this is the will of God

372
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,640
and Christ Jesus concerning you.

373
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,279
Yes, we're to thank God and praise him for his mighty acts,

374
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,080
but also according to his excellent greatness.

375
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,159
We find number three back in Hebrews chapter 13.

376
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,039
In Hebrews 13, as we look here at our,

377
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,259
a third reason here in our second part of this study

378
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:06,799
as to how or why we should rejoice.

379
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,559
Notice as we continue reading,

380
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,119
and we see here in v. 21,

381
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:11,959
the Bible says,

382
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,919
"...make you perfect in every good work

383
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,759
to do His will,

384
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,999
working in you that which is well-pleasing

385
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,039
in His sight through Jesus Christ,

386
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,079
to whom be glory forever and ever, Amen."

387
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,439
I would say that a third reason for us to rejoice

388
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,839
as I look at v. 21 this morning

389
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,079
is for the privilege of serving the Lord.

390
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,679
You know it's a unique privilege to serve God.

391
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:39,999
The songwriter said there is joy in serving Jesus.

392
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,599
And I agree with the songwriter.

393
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,599
I believe that there is joy in serving Jesus.

394
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,639
Notice what it says,

395
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,959
"...make you perfect in every good work

396
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,279
to do His will."

397
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,759
We understand here that as we think about

398
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,519
doing His will and serving the Lord,

399
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,959
that it is a privilege,

400
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,999
but we also understand that it's for His glory.

401
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,319
The Bible says here,

402
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,239
"...working in you that which is well-pleasing

403
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:04,239
in His sight."

404
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:08,039
What a joy to know that He's working in us.

405
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,319
And we'd ask ourselves the question this morning,

406
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,999
are we allowing Him to have His way with us?

407
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,999
Are we allowing Him to do that work within us

408
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,679
that He desires to do?

409
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,839
Remember at the end of chapter number 12

410
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,519
in verse number 28,

411
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,319
we read and we studied this portion

412
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,159
where the Bible says,

413
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,479
"...wherefore we receiving a kingdom

414
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,719
which cannot be moved.

415
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,479
Let us have grace," notice,

416
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:34,439
"...whereby we may serve God acceptably

417
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:37,639
with reverence and godly fear."

418
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:40,719
You know, it's a unique privilege to serve the Lord.

419
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,639
And we notice here this morning

420
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,679
that as we look at this truth

421
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,959
that He's working in us,

422
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,519
it says, "...through Jesus Christ,"

423
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,639
at the end of verse number 21,

424
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,919
"...to whom be glory forever and ever.

425
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,519
Amen."

426
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,519
As we serve the Lord,

427
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,639
we're not serving Him to be recognized,

428
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:00,999
to receive any glory here upon this earth.

429
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,919
We're serving Him so that He might be exalted,

430
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,999
so that He might be magnified,

431
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:08,359
so that He would receive the glory

432
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,439
that is due unto His name.

433
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,879
Notice as we often would reference

434
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,239
in Ephesians chapter number two,

435
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,159
verses eight and nine,

436
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,359
"...for by grace are you saved through faith."

437
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,359
And we understand the significance

438
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,799
of that doctrinal teaching

439
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,879
that we're not saved by our works,

440
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,719
but we do find that verse number 10,

441
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,559
not as often quoted with verses eight and nine,

442
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,399
that the Bible says,

443
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,719
"...for we are His workmanship,

444
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:36,199
created in Christ Jesus unto good works,

445
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,159
which God hath before ordained

446
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,919
that we should walk in them."

447
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,159
We understand this teaching in Ephesians 2,

448
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,839
really verses eight through 10.

449
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,999
We understand the reality of salvation

450
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,639
that it's by grace through faith.

451
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,279
It is of nothing that you or I could do.

452
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,119
It's not by works of righteousness,

453
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,039
which we have done.

454
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,719
It's according to His mercy.

455
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,799
And we find here, however,

456
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,839
that because we are saved,

457
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,439
that we are to be engaged in good works.

458
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,959
Now understand with me this morning,

459
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,319
it's not so that we could keep our salvation.

460
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,879
That's settled.

461
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,959
I'm thankful that He said that,

462
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,759
my sheep hear my voice and I know them

463
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,199
and I give unto them eternal life

464
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,359
and they should never perish.

465
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,839
I'm thankful this morning the Bible tells us

466
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,839
that we have the reality of an inheritance

467
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,919
that is reserved in heaven for us.

468
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,199
It's undefiled and it fadeth not away

469
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,359
according to what Peter tells us.

470
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,479
And as we understand the significance

471
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,639
of serving the Lord,

472
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,639
the reality is that I serve Him

473
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:40,279
out of all that He's done for us,

474
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,359
out of an appreciation of His work in us

475
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,839
and He is the one that enables us to serve Him.

476
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,479
We understand this morning

477
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:51,159
that not everyone will serve in the same capacity.

478
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:55,799
I'm thankful this morning I don't have two left hands.

479
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,799
I'd be in a mess.

480
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,359
Amen?

481
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,159
The reality is that we find in the Word of God

482
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,159
that God has used the picture of the human body

483
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,879
with reference to the church.

484
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,839
And it's a body that's fitly framed together

485
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,839
and we think how that each individual member of a church

486
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:20,319
has a particular gift that God has given them.

487
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,199
And as we use that collectively and corporately,

488
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,759
we use those gifts for the honor and glory of God,

489
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,199
we're able to accomplish all that God desires

490
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,799
for us to accomplish.

491
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,719
And as we come together as a church

492
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:34,679
and we serve God with the gifts and the talents

493
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:35,799
that He's given us,

494
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,799
it's so that He alone would be glorified.

495
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,519
We understand that we're the light of the world.

496
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,879
Let your light so shine.

497
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:46,639
And we understand what Jesus says there in Matthew 5,

498
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:47,839
that men may see your good works,

499
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,319
but glorify your Father, which is in heaven.

500
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,799
Notice with me this truth in 1 Peter chapter number four.

501
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,919
In 1 Peter chapter number four,

502
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,799
as we looked at the first six verses

503
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,439
of the 13th chapter of the book of Hebrews,

504
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:05,439
we referenced 1 Peter four a couple of times.

505
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,799
In 1 Peter chapter number four,

506
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,639
this morning we'll look at verses 10 and 11

507
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,479
as we reference this reason to rejoice,

508
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,879
the privilege of serving the Lord.

509
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,559
In verse number 10, the Bible says this

510
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
in 1 Peter four and verse number 10,

511
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,479
as every man hath received the gift.

512
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,719
We understand this morning,

513
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,279
we speak about spiritual gifts

514
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,039
that at the moment in which we trust

515
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,239
that Christ is our Savior,

516
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,719
the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

517
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,319
We understand that we're commissioned

518
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,439
and we're commanded to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

519
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,359
And we understand that as we look at the truth

520
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,079
of spiritual gifts that God equips

521
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,959
and gifts each individual.

522
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:49,199
And here it says, as every man hath received the gift,

523
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:52,599
notice what it says, even so minister

524
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,999
the same one to another as good stewards

525
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,159
of the manifold grace of God.

526
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:06,239
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God.

527
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,319
If any man minister, let him do it

528
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,439
as of the ability which God giveth.

529
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:15,799
Notice this, that God in all things

530
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,799
may be glorified through Jesus Christ,

531
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,799
to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, amen.

532
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,399
You have a spiritual gift, so do I.

533
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:31,679
And you've been given a unique privilege

534
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,879
of serving the Lord.

535
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,999
There are times in which we need to,

536
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,159
as we engage in serving the Lord,

537
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:40,999
we need to take that step back and say,

538
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,999
God, thank you for the privilege

539
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,399
of being able to serve you.

540
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,639
I understand sometimes it's tough,

541
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,759
it's work, it's challenging.

542
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,479
And we can get into the, oh, this is so much,

543
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,919
but if we just kinda change our perspective

544
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,239
just a little bit and say, you know what,

545
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,999
this is a unique privilege.

546
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:01,959
What an opportunity that I am allowed of the Lord

547
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:05,799
to serve the Lord God omnipotent.

548
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,719
I mean, we can serve him, what a joy.

549
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,119
What a blessing.

550
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,679
The reality this morning is that we really ought to rejoice

551
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,439
in any opportunity that God would give us to serve him.

552
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,759
And not just look for certain opportunities

553
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,319
that we think, oh, that would be a good one

554
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,159
for me to be able to be engaged and to get plugged in.

555
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,839
No, I just wanna serve God

556
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,879
because it's a privilege to serve him.

557
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,759
This morning, I wonder how often

558
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,079
we just take a step back and say,

559
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,879
you know what, Lord, thank you for letting me serve you.

560
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,959
I wanna rejoice for the privilege

561
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:43,599
of being enabled by you to serve you

562
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,279
so that you would be glorified.

563
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,919
It's interesting as we think about Paul,

564
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,999
and of course, Paul served the Lord

565
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:54,879
and we have a lot of scripture that's been written by Paul

566
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,719
and we understand that Paul has given us a great example.

567
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,279
He ministered greatly, but I wanna remind you

568
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,639
of what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 12.

569
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,759
He says, and I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord,

570
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,319
who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful,

571
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,599
putting me into the ministry.

572
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,679
Paul was rejoicing the privilege

573
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,079
that he had to serve the Lord.

574
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,719
And he understood that it was God who hath enabled him.

575
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,359
And this morning, we rejoice in the privilege

576
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,319
of serving the Lord.

577
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,159
Number four, back in Hebrews chapter 13,

578
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,320
as we continue looking in verse 22,

579
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,359
and actually there are several references

580
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,719
in these next few verses

581
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,239
with regard to this fourth point of ours,

582
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,799
the Bible says in verse number 22,

583
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,599
and I beseech you, notice,

584
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,599
brethren, suffer the word of exhortation,

585
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,839
for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

586
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,799
So as we looked at part of verse number 22 last week,

587
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,799
when we were speaking about the word of God,

588
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,559
verse nine and verse 22,

589
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,159
dealing with the word of God and how we ought to rejoice

590
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,839
and thank God for his word.

591
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,119
Verse number 23, know ye that our brother, Timothy,

592
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,440
is set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly,

593
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
I will see you.

594
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
So notice in verse number 22 that he says,

595
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,559
and I beseech you, brethren,

596
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,919
notice in verse number 23,

597
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,440
he says that our brother, Timothy,

598
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,199
and then in verse number 24, it says,

599
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,079
salute all them that have the rule over you.

600
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,239
Notice this, and all the saints,

601
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:26,799
they of Italy, salute you.

602
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,639
As I look at these few verses of scripture,

603
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,759
I would say this, number four, reason to rejoice.

604
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,039
Rejoice for fellow believers, for the brethren,

605
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,279
for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

606
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,320
I understand as we look at the word of God here,

607
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,959
and we find that this book of Hebrews

608
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,679
has been written to believers there in the first century,

609
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,320
these Jewish believers,

610
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,639
and we understand as we've studied

611
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,399
the entirety of the book now,

612
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,119
we understand some of the difficulties

613
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,039
in which they were facing

614
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,519
and some of the pressures to return to Judaism,

615
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,719
and we find that the writer says,

616
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,559
I beseech you.

617
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,799
you brethren." We've referenced other portions of Scripture here through the

618
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,039
book of Hebrews, how that he refers to them as being brethren, brothers and

619
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,759
sisters in Christ. We find that he then speaks about a specific brother, Timothy,

620
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,879
in verse number 23, and that he's been set at liberty. We are familiar with

621
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:25,899
Timothy. We understand that Paul refers to Timothy as his son in the faith. We

622
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:29,959
understand that there are two letters that are written to Timothy, 1st and 2nd

623
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:35,199
Timothy, with instruction with regard to the ministry that God had given him, and

624
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:39,399
so we see the specific brother that is mentioned in verse 23, and then we come

625
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,359
to verse number 24, and he says, "...salute all them that have the rule over you,"

626
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,759
really a reference to the spiritual leaders that have already been referenced

627
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,959
in verse 7 and 17, and then he says, "...and all the saints." He's

628
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,919
talking about giving greetings to all the saints, and then he says this at the

629
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,479
end of verse number 24, "...they of Italy salute you." So what is he saying? There's

630
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:07,680
some believers over there in Italy that are sending their greetings as well. You

631
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,559
know, something that's unique, and I've not traveled extensively around the

632
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,799
world, but I've understood as I've had the opportunity to share testimony with

633
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,000
others and to hear them share their testimony,

634
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,639
Ms. Joyce has traveled extensively, and you hear those that would travel

635
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:26,839
extensively, and they would say something like this, "...no matter where I

636
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:31,879
went, I was able to find other believers. I was able to find brothers and sisters

637
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:35,799
in Christ that I could rejoice with." There are times in which we've had the

638
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,759
opportunity to be in the presence of other believers that maybe you've had

639
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,439
difficulty with communication because of language barrier, but you have that bond

640
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:49,000
in Christ. I remember when I was down in Mexico just a couple of years ago

641
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,040
visiting with the Wheeler family and ministering there and distributing all

642
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,839
sorts of literature, and on that missions trip I remember standing in the

643
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,000
auditorium of that church on a Sunday evening after the service, and I remember

644
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,079
standing there, and my Spanish is not very good, and their English was as good

645
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,520
as my Spanish, and so there was a real challenge in being able to communicate

646
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,080
one with another, and there was this dear brother that just stood there, and you

647
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,759
could just tell how he just wanted to engage in conversation with us, and you

648
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:27,479
could tell how that he just was overjoyed with excitement as to the work

649
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,479
that was being accomplished and all that was being done, and every once in a while,

650
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:34,239
probably every two or three minutes, he'd just start talking to us again, and we

651
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,679
still didn't understand what he was saying, but he just had that desire to

652
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,679
want to communicate, and we think about the brethren. Listen, there are believers

653
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:52,759
all over the globe, and we have the privilege as a local church to rejoice

654
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,119
and thank God one for another, our brothers and sisters in Christ. Well, we

655
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,119
ought to pray one for another, but aren't you thankful that God's given you some

656
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:08,199
fellow believers? Aren't you thankful for some brethren that are able to hear you

657
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:11,800
say, would you pray for me, and that they're able to say to you, I am praying

658
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:19,080
for you, and vice versa, that we're able to serve the Lord together as believers?

659
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,080
You remember Elijah, he kind of had that that it's only me syndrome, right? And we

660
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,559
can read of that, we won't take the time to go back to 1st Kings 19 and read all

661
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,319
that had transpired there, but he has that idea, I am the only one. God said,

662
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:39,220
Elijah, I just want you to understand there's 7,000 that have not bowed the

663
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,580
knee to Baal. And see, there were others. He felt like he was the only one. I'm not

664
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,940
sure if you've ever been in a place where maybe you felt like you were in

665
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,459
solidarity, that you were the only one, you're the only believer in a particular

666
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:57,619
location, but you're reminded that there are other brothers and sisters in Christ.

667
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,500
Just a few chapters back in Hebrews chapter number 10, notice the reminder

668
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,139
that we were given as we studied this portion several weeks ago in Hebrews

669
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:12,380
chapter number 10 and verses 24 and 25. The Bible says, "...and let us consider one

670
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,940
another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of

671
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,260
ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much

672
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,139
the more as ye see the day approaching." I'm mindful as I look at these verses in

673
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,619
Hebrews 10 and verses 24 and 25, the way in which we need each other, the brothers

674
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:41,220
and sisters in Christ. On Tuesday evening we had prayer, praise, and pie,

675
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,399
and there were some that made reference and were thanking the Lord and speaking

676
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,419
about the church family and how we're a family. You know, I'm so thankful for that.

677
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:56,299
We understand that the reality is that we need to strive for unity and

678
00:34:56,299 --> 00:35:02,019
that we need to recognize the blessing of being brethren, brothers and sisters

679
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:07,100
in Christ. We need to thank God for that and we serve God together and we thank

680
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:15,859
God for the privilege. The writer here is telling these believers that are

681
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:19,220
struggling with some difficulties, he says, listen, there's a lot of other

682
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,019
believers out there. There's a lot of brethren and we're saluting you and

683
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,380
we want you to have our greetings. You know when you read through the

684
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,100
epistles and you read about the names of the individuals that are mentioned,

685
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,820
you begin to read how that Paul, on a number of occasion, he'll mention a

686
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,579
number of folks at the end of the letters in which he writes, send my

687
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,700
greetings to this person and that person and salute this one and salute that one.

688
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,820
Man, it causes us to rejoice because there's believers all over the place.

689
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,459
I believe even as it was mentioned on Tuesday evening during our prayer, praise,

690
00:35:55,459 --> 00:36:00,100
and pie, that a year like 2020 with so many of the restrictions and regulations

691
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,299
that it would help us to be mindful of how appreciative we really should be for

692
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:13,899
the brethren, the believers. And I'm so thankful that God would allow us

693
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:18,820
to serve him together and we need to be mindful of one another. We need to thank

694
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:28,000
God for fellow believers. Number five, the passage ends as many of our New

695
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,660
Testament books begin or end, speaking of grace or mercy, and we find here it ends

696
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,100
by saying, grace be with you all, amen. We ought to thank God for his grace, the

697
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,820
grace of God. We understand, even as we sang this morning, and how appropriate

698
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,339
amazing grace. I hope that Brother Don was able to be watching on live stream

699
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:58,739
this morning as that's his favorite song. And often over the years, as we would

700
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:04,779
sing any number that's anywhere remotely close to 187, he'd kind of wonder why we

701
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:09,459
didn't pick 187 on that particular day. Why has it got to be 186? Why has it got

702
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:14,339
to be 184? Why not 187? You know, he just loves the song. We really think about

703
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:20,299
God's amazing grace. It is amazing. It's abundant. We think about the grace of

704
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:26,700
God. And this morning, we ought to thank God for his grace. And as we think about the

705
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,459
grace of God, and we've mentioned on a number of occasions, not only his saving

706
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:34,859
grace, but his serving grace, his enablement as we serve him. We spoke

707
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:40,019
about earlier the privilege of serving the Lord and how God gives us grace.

708
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,779
Peter says that we'd be good stewards of the manifold grace of God, that serving

709
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:49,459
grace. We think about the way in which the epistle ends,

710
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:55,980
grace be with you all, amen. And it's interesting because the way that this

711
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:03,459
letter, this book of Hebrews begins is with God. God, who at sundry times and in

712
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:08,179
divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, and it ends

713
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:15,500
by a reminder of God's grace. Grace be with you all, amen. As we think about the

714
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
grace of God, I want to look here at Titus chapter number two. Why don't you

715
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,019
turn there with me? And as we look at Titus chapter number two and remind it

716
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:31,179
about some very important truth with regard to God's grace. We understand that

717
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:37,099
as Jude would write and give warning because it was needful for him to write

718
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:41,020
about these things because there were men, certain men, that had crept in

719
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,700
unawares, he tells us that one of the things that these false teachers did is

720
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,419
that they were turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness. And that word is

721
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:59,659
not often used today in our vernacular, but it means unbridled lust. And he says

722
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:03,940
this is a problem. We look at Titus chapter number two and God gives us some

723
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,059
really good instruction with regard to the grace of God. Notice in verse number

724
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,460
11 in Titus chapter number two, the Bible says,

725
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,500
for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.

726
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,140
Aren't you thankful that the Bible teaches us, for by grace are you saved

727
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:31,419
through faith? And God's saving grace. Notice, however, as Paul continues

728
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:36,380
writing to Titus here with regard to the subject matter of grace, he tells us

729
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:43,580
what grace teaches us. It says this in verse number 12, teaching us that denying

730
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:52,179
ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in

731
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:58,900
this present world. That's a powerful verse of Scripture. We're thankful that

732
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,539
we're under grace and not under the law. Amen?

733
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,699
and what a blessing to live on this side of Calvary, I'm so thankful for it, but we

734
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,499
understand this morning there are some that have violated the the teaching of

735
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:16,259
grace and they've kind of said something like those false teachers, that

736
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:20,379
unbridled lust, that lasciviousness, I'm under grace, I can do what I want, you

737
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:24,399
can't tell me, so on and so forth. Well here, the Word of God tells us, as we

738
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:28,339
would thank God for grace, that grace teaches us some things, it teaches us

739
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:33,339
some things that were denied, ungodliness and worldly lust. It teaches us how we're

740
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:37,819
to live, we're to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present

741
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:42,979
world. Then, of course, we're mindful of the great promise in verse number 13,

742
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:46,579
looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and

743
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:52,899
our Savior, Jesus Christ. I'm so thankful for the grace of God. This morning I

744
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:59,139
believe that many of us, we could consider where we would be if it were

745
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:03,819
not for grace. In fact, there's a song that just after I got saved, when I was

746
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:09,019
living in California, I visited a Bible college and I remember a Bible college

747
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:14,819
singing a song, were it not for grace. And as the songwriter of that particular

748
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:18,619
song, and I don't know all the words to the song, but I remember part of the

749
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,459
chorus is that if it were not for grace, I would be on a hopeless road to

750
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:27,739
nowhere. And I thought, man, that's pretty accurate as to where our lives would be

751
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,279
going. Of course, we understand without Christ we would spend eternity in the

752
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:38,499
lake of fire. I'm so thankful for God's grace. This morning, as we finish the book

753
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:42,679
of Hebrews and we finish this 13th chapter and we come to verses 7 through

754
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:48,259
25, and we just kind of dissect and meditate upon all of these verses of

755
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:53,059
Scripture, we find that there are at least 10 reasons for which we ought to

756
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:58,219
rejoice. This morning, as God's people, we're to be a thankful people. We're to

757
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:02,539
be a rejoicing people. We're to be a people that do not live under the

758
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:07,739
circumstances, amen? We got our eyes upon Jesus, the author and finisher of our

759
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:12,099
faith. We understand that he has a plan and that his plan is perfect. He never

760
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:16,699
makes a mistake. He never has and he never will. Every promise that he has

761
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:22,459
given is sure, because he's not a man that he should lie. He's able to fulfill

762
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:27,499
all that he said that he would do. One day, he's coming again. These believers

763
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:31,979
had been reminded of that back in the ninth and tenth chapter about the soon

764
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:36,019
return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. As a preacher of yesteryear said,

765
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:40,179
we're a day closer than we've ever been, and it's true. We're closer today than

766
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:46,379
we've ever been. And this morning, we have reasons to rejoice, and I hope that as we

767
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:51,979
would meditate upon these 10 unique things that are mentioned in this passage

768
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:55,739
of Scripture, that we would understand that these are reasons to rejoice that

769
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:02,939
that no one's going to take away from us. On a day in which it seems as if

770
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:07,779
nothing seems to go right, I know we've all kind of had those type of days where

771
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:11,339
it seems like, what is going on? It'd be a good day to go back to bed kind of a

772
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,459
situation. But you know, we have reasons to rejoice. We have reasons to rejoice.

773
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:20,699
Our God's still upon the throne. You say, pastor, you're aware of the things that

774
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,979
are going on in the world? Sometimes I don't want to be aware of the things that are

775
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:27,259
going on in the world, amen? Listen, if you're too aware of the things going on in the

776
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:30,939
world, you get yourself in a sideways, and you get yourself all kinds of mixed up.

777
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:35,459
But we keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, understanding

778
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:40,619
that that he has a perfect plan, and he's given us his word. We ought to rejoice in

779
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,779
it this morning. Let's spend more time in prayer. Let's spend more time in his word.

780
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:51,579
Let's spend more time praying one for another, and rejoicing and thanking God

781
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:57,219
for these ten particular things that are mentioned in Hebrews 13, 7 through 25.

782
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:02,019
Say, God, I just want to thank you. I just want to thank you for who you are, for what

783
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:06,539
you've done, for these particular blessings that you've bestowed upon us

784
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:11,619
as your children, these privileges. Lord, you've been so good to us, and he really

785
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:19,219
has been. And oh, how we ought to rejoice. Remember the 15th verse, our lips giving

786
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:26,059
thanks unto his name. Think about that, your lips, my lips, our lips collectively giving

787
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:32,939
thanks to his name. He is worthy in everything give thanks, for this is the will of God and

788
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:39,739
Christ Jesus concerning you. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

789
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:44,779
thank you for the opportunity to study this book of Hebrews. We understand that the believers

790
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:49,419
that are being written to here in this book, the original recipients, they were dealing

791
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:58,899
with some very challenging times, some difficulties, opposition, adversity, persecution. They've

792
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:07,259
been encouraged through this entire book to understand that Christ is superior. He's better.

793
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:12,939
We've been encouraged to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith, of our

794
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:21,699
faith. They've been encouraged to rejoice. Lord, this morning as we look at the content

795
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:28,499
of this last section of Hebrews 13, I pray that you'd encourage us this morning, help

796
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:35,459
us to be mindful of these unique privileges that you've given us as your children, and

797
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:40,659
that God, we would rejoice in the privilege of prayer, the resurrection of our Lord and

798
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:50,179
Savior Jesus Christ, the opportunity to serve you for fellow believers and for your grace.

799
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:54,779
I pray God that if there's one present or one under the sound of my voice, perhaps even

800
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:58,299
watching live stream that does not know you as their personal Lord and Savior, they've

801
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:02,899
never trusted Christ. They do not know for sure that if they were to die today that heaven

802
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:07,379
is their home. It's our prayer that they would be saved, that they would trust Christ

803
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:13,459
as their Savior. For each of your children, God, would you help us to be mindful of these

804
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:21,579
unique privileges that you've given us and help us to rejoice greatly, that our lips

805
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:26,459
would give thanks to your name. I pray that you'd work during this time of invitation,

806
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:30,219
that you'd have your will and way in each life. We'll thank you for decisions that are

807
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,099
made, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

808
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:38,579
eyes are closed. No one's looking around. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano,

809
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,219
and as she does, the altar's open. Make your pew an altar. Come up to this old-fashioned

810
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,859
altar. Maybe you just want to come and thank God for some of the things that we looked

811
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,899
at this morning. Perhaps there's something else the Lord laid upon your heart that you

812
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:54,019
need to be thankful for. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
