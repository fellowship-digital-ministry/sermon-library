1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
the last 11 weeks on Sunday evenings.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,280
Well, 11 weeks of messages,

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,860
so not 11 calendar weeks,

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,960
but 11 services that we have had a message

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,119
from these seven churches.

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,359
And so 11 messages on the seven churches,

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,559
and what a blessing to have the opportunity

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,879
to study them and to be encouraged by them,

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,040
to be challenged.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,000
And I am thankful for each of these letters

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,799
and for God preserving his word for us.

12
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,240
And as I mentioned this morning,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,860
in summary, if you will, I'd like to consider,

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,360
I've titled the message this evening,

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,799
Seven Lessons from Seven Churches.

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,200
I wanna remind you this evening,

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,119
as we begin to look at Revelation 2 and 3,

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,279
that these are seven local churches.

19
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,279
They are churches that existed in the first century.

20
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,840
They are churches in which the Lord Jesus Christ

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,599
instructs John to write these letters to them.

22
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,279
And we find that these churches

23
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,720
were in existence at that time.

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,099
Obviously, there were many more than these seven churches.

25
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:05,839
There were a lot more churches that were around

26
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:09,959
that were definitely capable of receiving a letter,

27
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,480
but these are the seven churches

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,559
that the Lord in his wisdom

29
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:16,500
chose to have these letters written to.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,180
I believe that these churches are representative

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,480
of all churches throughout the church age.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
What do I mean by that?

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,239
Well, we find that these churches

34
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,139
are not necessarily representative of a certain section

35
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:34,199
or period of time within the broad sense of the church age.

36
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:37,440
In other words, the first church that is referenced,

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,919
the church at Ephesus,

38
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:41,000
not every church in the first and second

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,680
or however long you wanna divide up the timeline

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,559
were like the church at Ephesus.

41
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,360
And not every church today,

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,580
as we're nearing the end of the church age,

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,199
we see the day approaching,

44
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,959
not every church today has to model

45
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,839
what is said about the church of the Laodiceans.

46
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:01,099
I believe that in every era of church history,

47
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,680
there have been churches that could,

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,440
as you evaluate them,

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,399
they align with maybe the church at Smyrna

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,539
or they align with the church in Sardis.

51
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,979
And maybe there's an element of this church

52
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,679
and that church that are combined within the church.

53
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,600
And so there are some that take the approach

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,720
that we're living in the Laodicean period

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,740
of the church age.

56
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
And therefore, basically they'd say there's no hope,

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,119
we're all just the church of the Laodiceans

58
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:33,419
and that's what our lot is and that's what it is.

59
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,720
In fact, many of them that would have that approach

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,660
would say there's not even a hope for revival.

61
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,839
That's a sad outlook, is it not?

62
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:44,240
Not only do I not believe that it's biblical,

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
but the reality is that I believe

64
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,419
that our God can send revival.

65
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,940
I believe that our God wants to send revival.

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,179
I believe that we can be a church,

67
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,919
as I've mentioned multiple times throughout the series,

68
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,259
that we can be a church that is God honoring,

69
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,320
that is doing God's work God's way.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,539
And what a blessing.

71
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,580
In Sunday school this morning,

72
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,580
I dealt a little bit with the idea of the church

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,860
and what is the church

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,580
and what's the importance of the church.

75
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,220
And those of you that were in Sunday school

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,580
got to hear some of that lesson.

77
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,100
It was very interactive on purpose

78
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,820
and getting some feedback.

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,500
And I mentioned something that happened in 2020.

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,860
I did not include this part of it.

81
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,300
I wanted to be able to include it this morning,

82
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,940
but if you were there this evening,

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
if you were there this morning,

84
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,220
you would be able to connect these dots.

85
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,300
But in 2019, so something very significant happened in 2020.

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,220
We know what that was.

87
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,539
It was COVID, all right?

88
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,320
It is probably etched in our minds forever and ever

89
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,720
that 2020, someone mentions the year

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,899
and immediately you're gonna think

91
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,779
you're gonna be reminded of the COVID year.

92
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,300
And all of the differences and changes

93
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,020
and all the things that we went through.

94
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,740
And by the way, I hope that we never go through

95
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,300
something like that again.

96
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,899
And for many of us,

97
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,240
it was the first time we ever went through it.

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,940
I remember sitting around having conversations

99
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,839
with different people.

100
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,979
I remember being on calls with lawyers and others.

101
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,179
And there more than one time that a preacher would say,

102
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,380
they didn't teach us this in Bible college.

103
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,919
And we'd say, that's right, man.

104
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,380
They didn't teach us anything about this

105
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,860
in Bible college, right?

106
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,260
But the reality is that

107
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,220
that was a significant event in 2020.

108
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,059
What I mentioned in Sunday school this morning

109
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,940
was that in 2020, our government

110
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,420
and many governments around the world

111
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,140
began to categorize businesses or institutions.

112
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,140
And they used this word essential.

113
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,940
You obviously remember that.

114
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,779
It's not been that long ago.

115
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,420
And you remember how they would categorize certain things

116
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,899
as being essential while others were non-essential.

117
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,380
We had it not only for businesses and organizations,

118
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,660
we had it for personnel.

119
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,100
There was essential personnel

120
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
and there was non-essential personnel.

121
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,500
And we understand all of that.

122
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,820
We lived through it.

123
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,359
And we asked the question in Sunday school this morning,

124
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:02,260
why is it that the government for the most part

125
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,859
was willing to say and to look at an establishment

126
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:10,579
such as a liquor store and say that they're essential,

127
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,559
but yet they would look at the church

128
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,600
and say that they're non-essential?

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
That's what happened.

130
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,519
Yeah.

131
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,880
So let me tell you of something that happened in 2019.

132
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,079
We asked the question in Sunday school,

133
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,679
why is it that they said that the church was not essential?

134
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,420
There were some answers that were provided.

135
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,959
And really, we said that really what has to happen

136
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,779
is we as the people of God have to stand up

137
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,440
and take responsibility that we stopped for decades,

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
for generations, making the church vital.

139
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
We'll skip church for all sorts of things.

140
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,959
So through our negligence to church

141
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,839
and our behavior saying that church isn't essential,

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,640
though we wouldn't use those words,

143
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,519
we're communicating to a lost world

144
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,359
that the church really isn't essential.

145
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:05,399
So in 2019, Barna did a study.

146
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,279
And some of you are familiar with Barna studies,

147
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,600
the Barna group, so on and so forth.

148
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,799
And I understand statistics,

149
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,359
they can be kind of skewed and what have you.

150
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:17,040
But I'm just gonna tell you what the study revealed in 2019.

151
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,119
So this is prior to COVID.

152
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:24,119
In 2019, 44%, that's almost half,

153
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,440
44% of Americans that claimed to be Christian.

154
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,239
Now understand that's a broad category, okay?

155
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,079
I get it.

156
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,720
I understand that there are people

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,859
that claim to be Christian,

158
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,839
but that doesn't truly mean they're born again.

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,359
I understand all of that.

160
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:44,160
But these are at least people that said, I'm a Christian.

161
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,200
They identified with that as they took this survey.

162
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,239
And of those that claim to be Christians,

163
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:55,920
44% of them said church is not essential.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
44% said church is not essential.

165
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,880
Now that was answering a survey.

166
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,239
I wonder what the percentage is

167
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:14,119
of those that would never actually say the words,

168
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,500
but their behavior says church is not essential.

169
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,059
Do you understand what I'm saying this evening?

170
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,079
The Lord Jesus Christ gave to us in his word,

171
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,119
and we dealt with this in Sunday school a bit,

172
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,559
and it segues with the message this evening.

173
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,480
He revealed to us in his word,

174
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,600
what the value or the worth of the church is.

175
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,119
The Bible tells us that Jesus said,

176
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,279
after he asked the question to the disciples,

177
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,839
whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

178
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,679
Whom say ye that I am?

179
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,600
We find that Jesus then makes this great declaration,

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,959
I will build my church.

181
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,420
And he gives to us, he reveals to us

182
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,279
in that single statement,

183
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,640
the fact that he is going to be actively engaged

184
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,160
in working and building his church.

185
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,220
It is his church.

186
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,279
It's not my church.

187
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,640
It's not our church.

188
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
It is his church.

189
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,079
I understand sometimes we use the vernacular,

190
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,100
and we'll use the phraseology that this is my church,

191
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,720
or will you come to my church or our church.

192
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
But I think for the most part,

193
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,160
we understand biblically that Christ is the head

194
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,040
of the church.

195
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,200
And when we use that terminology,

196
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
we're not claiming that we're the head of it.

197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,440
We're simply saying this is the church that I'm part of.

198
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,000
But we understand that Jesus said I will build my church.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,359
Then in Acts 20 and verse 28,

200
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,979
and also in Ephesians five and verse 25,

201
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,919
the Bible tells us that Christ valued the church so much

202
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,880
that he gave his life for it.

203
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:47,440
He bought the church with his own blood,

204
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,640
according to Acts 20 and verse 28.

205
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,059
So how do we value something?

206
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:56,440
How do we set a value or a worth on something?

207
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,659
How vital is church to us?

208
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,500
Well, we understand how important church is to God.

209
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,539
Church is not man's idea.

210
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,539
Church is God's idea.

211
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,460
Amen?

212
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,059
It's not man's idea.

213
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,419
Church didn't begin with man having this idea

214
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,059
that we're going to have this thing called.

215
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,140
No, God, the Lord Jesus Christ,

216
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,179
he's the one that instituted,

217
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,260
he's the one that instructed,

218
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,580
and he gives to us the local church,

219
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,520
and what a blessing.

220
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,559
So these seven churches that are written to,

221
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,599
that are given these chapters,

222
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,719
Revelation two and three,

223
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,859
as we have the opportunity to go through them,

224
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,039
we see that these are churches,

225
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,039
why does God even care to write to these churches?

226
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Because he loves the church.

227
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
Because he loves the church.

228
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,080
And I wonder this evening,

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,280
I hope tonight that if we were to take a survey

230
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,760
amongst those that are present,

231
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,159
that the numbers would be nowhere near.

232
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,359
or what the Barna study was in 2019.

233
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:08,039
But does it not reveal to you an element this evening

234
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,639
as to why the government would say in 2020

235
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,679
that the church is not essential

236
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,759
if 44% of those that claim to be Christians in 2019

237
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,319
said the church is not essential?

238
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,399
What does it mean when they say the church is not essential?

239
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,319
Well, basically, if it fits my schedule, I'll attend.

240
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,879
If nothing else interferes, I'll attend.

241
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,199
If something else comes up that's more important

242
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,279
that takes precedence,

243
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,679
then, well, you know, it's not really important.

244
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,239
That's a bad perspective

245
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,499
because the church is the bride of Christ.

246
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:43,339
Amen?

247
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:45,239
Is that biblically that we'll study

248
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,579
as we get through the book of Revelation?

249
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,679
It's gonna be months and months and months from now.

250
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,639
We talk about the marriage supper of the Lamb.

251
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,039
The church is the bride of Christ.

252
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,599
God has no other option, quote unquote,

253
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,159
for this era.

254
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,399
It's the church.

255
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,639
It's the church.

256
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,919
There's no backup plan.

257
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,999
There's no plan B.

258
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,359
There's the church.

259
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:11,159
And why is it that he writes to these churches

260
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,359
is because he loves them,

261
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:17,319
because he's concerned about what's going on in the churches.

262
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:20,079
He's actively involved in the churches,

263
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,479
and he sees, and so why does God take the time to write

264
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:28,599
and to commend and also to correct and to give instruction?

265
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,439
Why?

266
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,239
Because he loves the church.

267
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:34,599
And tonight, if we could just grasp that truth,

268
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,319
that we could understand this evening

269
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,439
that God gives us these truths in his word

270
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:40,559
because he loves us,

271
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,399
because he wants us to know the right way and the best way,

272
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,599
and he wants us to know how that we're to behave

273
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,839
and how that we're to live,

274
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,479
and he wants us to have that same level

275
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:54,159
of valuing the church like he does.

276
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,639
The church is known as the body of Christ.

277
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,279
The bride of Christ, but also the body of Christ.

278
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,999
I don't know how many of us this evening,

279
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,679
thinking about the picture of the body of Christ,

280
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,959
I don't think any of us would say,

281
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,159
you know, go ahead and cut my right arm off,

282
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,359
I'm gonna do without it.

283
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,919
You'd be crazy, right?

284
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,439
What about the body of Christ?

285
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,519
How do we function?

286
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,519
How do we fulfill the purpose that God has for us?

287
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,439
Does that make sense to you this evening?

288
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:34,999
I read years ago, and I don't remember the exact source,

289
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,399
it just came to my mind right now

290
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,839
of the fact that I read this

291
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,599
and I didn't prepare to say this,

292
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,439
so I don't have the source in my notes,

293
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,439
but I read years ago that there were churches

294
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,759
prior to the time of electricity.

295
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,719
We come in here, we have central air conditioning,

296
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,359
we have lights that turn on with a switch

297
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,479
and so on and so forth.

298
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,759
Every now and then we get a power outage

299
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,799
and it's like, what are we gonna do, right?

300
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,759
And I say, folks on livestream,

301
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,639
we got a serious thunderstorm coming through,

302
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,639
you might lose us, but we're gonna just keep having church.

303
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,639
But I read this account prior to the time

304
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,239
in which electricity was available and prevalent,

305
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,839
where in the church house, an individual went in

306
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,199
and they saw these pews and on the end of each pew,

307
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,359
there was a hook on the end that was about this high.

308
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,999
And they walked into the church and it had been years later

309
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,959
and they were not familiar with the era

310
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,479
and what was going on and they said,

311
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,359
what are these about?

312
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,159
That's a valid question, is it not?

313
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,119
And the individual said, well, here's how it worked

314
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,639
prior to electricity, when you came into church,

315
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,999
you would hang your lantern on the hook.

316
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,439
And he went on to say this,

317
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:48,399
when people were missing, it really affected the whole.

318
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,559
Why?

319
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,399
Well, because you sit over there by yourself

320
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,319
and it's only as bright as your one lantern produces light.

321
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,199
But when everyone's in their place and all the lanterns are,

322
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:05,399
now all of a sudden the whole building is illuminated.

323
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,279
I thought, man, that's powerful, that's powerful.

324
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:17,119
This evening, the church is the body of Christ,

325
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,039
it's the bride of Christ.

326
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,039
The church is precious.

327
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,319
I don't know if you've ever been in a place

328
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,399
where there's no local church.

329
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,999
I mean, a good local church.

330
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,119
I live in a place in Nevada

331
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,519
where there was no good local church,

332
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,919
70 miles from where we live.

333
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,719
There was nowhere, no good local church.

334
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,079
Went to the best one we could go to.

335
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,359
I talked to Dean this afternoon

336
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,879
after the Sunday school lesson, he came to me

337
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,319
and he said, you know, I was in Colorado

338
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,959
working for a number of years.

339
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,719
And for those, I think he said it was 11 years

340
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,799
that he was working there.

341
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,199
From this date to this date

342
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,279
is when he worked out in Colorado.

343
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:56,799
And so for all those months, five months out of the year,

344
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,279
he said the closest good church

345
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,519
was 150 miles away, one direction.

346
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,919
Can you imagine?

347
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,919
You know how difficult that is for your Christian life,

348
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,279
your Christian walk?

349
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,479
You can't come to church.

350
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,159
We choose not to go to church

351
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,619
for certain reasons, whatever they are,

352
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,359
but then you talk to people that are not able

353
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,639
to go to church and how they desperately wish

354
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,079
they could be in church.

355
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,999
Someone has wisely said over the years

356
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,479
and they've applied it to a number of things.

357
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,499
Oftentimes we don't know,

358
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,959
we don't appreciate something the way that we should

359
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,659
until we no longer have it.

360
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:34,859
And this evening, as we look at these seven lessons

361
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,139
from seven churches, we've dealt with 11 weeks

362
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,579
of going through these.

363
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,419
So I'm not gonna belabor any of the points specifically,

364
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,079
but I wanna share seven thoughts with you.

365
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,719
Number one, God knows our works.

366
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,639
To every single church, all seven churches,

367
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,639
Jesus says, I know thy works.

368
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,919
It reveals to us his omniscience.

369
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,159
It reveals to us that he knows everything.

370
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,319
He knows not only our, excuse me,

371
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:07,519
not only our work, but our motive behind our work.

372
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,399
He knows why we're doing it.

373
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,719
And we find that in each of these letters,

374
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:16,719
he says to these churches, I know thy works.

375
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,599
I wonder this evening, as we consider

376
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:22,079
just that simple truth that's revealed

377
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,859
to each of these seven churches,

378
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,879
I wonder if we were in a position

379
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,959
as these churches are this evening

380
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,439
that had these letters written,

381
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,559
I wonder tonight if God were to write a letter

382
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,279
about us as a local church,

383
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,719
Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton, Virginia,

384
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:40,599
or I wonder if God were to give some level

385
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,639
of writing with regard to our lives as individuals,

386
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,239
what would God say about our works?

387
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,799
Because God knows our works.

388
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,599
And I understand that even as the church

389
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:56,159
of the Laodiceans, oftentimes we have a perspective

390
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,599
and it can be skewed.

391
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,879
God knows our works.

392
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,399
Let me say this, number two,

393
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,259
activity doesn't equal spirituality.

394
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,339
Activity doesn't equal spirituality.

395
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,959
There's a number of these churches

396
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,199
as we studied through them, we said this,

397
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,579
Ephesus is a great example,

398
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,579
there's others that are great examples as well.

399
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,599
We said this, if I move to a new town,

400
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,139
if I move to a new location and I was looking for a church,

401
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,879
man, that church hits all the things that I'm looking for.

402
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,679
They got this program and that program

403
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,799
and they got this thing going on

404
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,199
and they got activity after activity after activity.

405
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:39,279
But Jesus says to the church there in Ephesus,

406
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,039
you've left your first love.

407
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,939
We find here this evening in chapter number three

408
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,639
with the church in Sardis, he says to them,

409
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,159
I know thy works, he says this in verse number one

410
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,559
at the end of the verse, that thou hast a name

411
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,819
that thou livest, noticed, and are dead.

412
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,359
Activity can never be a substitute for spirituality.

413
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,659
Activity doesn't equal spirituality.

414
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,319
There's some times in which we wanna be busy, busy, busy,

415
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,839
busy, busy, but we're neglecting our time with God.

416
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,039
We're neglecting that true spiritual aspect

417
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,299
of our walk with God and our growth in Christ

418
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,839
and it's absolutely important this evening

419
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,559
that we recognize that activity

420
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,919
doesn't substitute for spirituality,

421
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,099
it does not equal spirituality.

422
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,779
You can be busy, but not be spiritual.

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You can be busy, but not doing the most important thing.

424
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,159
Do you remember this?

425
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,039
We looked at this here in some of these churches.

426
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,199
I just referenced the church in Sardis there

427
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,559
in chapter number two to the church at Ephesus

428
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,319
and nevertheless in verse four, I have somewhat against thee

429
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,039
because thou hast left thy first love,

430
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,659
but I wanna remind you of Mary and Martha.

431
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:55,039
You're familiar with it, no doubt,

432
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,679
Luke chapter number 10,

433
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,799
and it's a familiar passage of scripture.

434
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,919
In Luke chapter number 10,

435
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,599
we find that they're gathered together here

436
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,599
and Jesus is there and we find that the Bible tells us

437
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,239
in Luke chapter 10, beginning in verse number 38,

438
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,159
now it came to pass as they went

439
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,799
that he, Christ, entered into a certain village

440
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,479
and a certain woman named Martha received him

441
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,719
into her house and she had a sister called Mary,

442
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:22,119
which also, notice what the Bible says of Mary,

443
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,500
sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word.

444
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,940
She was sitting at the feet of Christ.

445
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,099
She's hearing the word.

446
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,739
We find that verse 40 says,

447
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:38,259
but Martha was cumbered about much serving.

448
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,099
You know what she was doing?

449
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:40,519
She was busy, she was active.

450
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:44,139
She was doing, doing, doing, right?

451
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,819
And the Bible says, and came to him, came to Jesus,

452
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,899
and said, Lord, dost thou not care

453
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,000
that my sister hath left me to serve alone?

454
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,179
Bid her therefore that she help me.

455
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,619
Jesus answered and said unto her,

456
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,859
I can almost hear the voice of Christ

457
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,139
when I read this verse.

458
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:05,079
I don't think Christ was rebuking her in a very stern way.

459
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:13,779
I think Jesus Christ, in a very compassionate tone, said, Martha, Martha, Martha, I mean

460
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:20,619
just very compassionately, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

461
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,739
But then what does he say in verse number 42?

462
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:32,959
But one thing is needful, one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part which

463
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:36,899
shall not be taken away from her.

464
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,059
Does it mean that we don't serve?

465
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,079
No, it doesn't mean that we don't serve, but you better get it in the right order.

466
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,039
You can't serve in your own power.

467
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,239
You need the power of Christ.

468
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,599
You need the grace of God.

469
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,759
We need to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

470
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,959
You need his enabling and his empowerment.

471
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,879
And we understand this evening that when we look at this passage in this illustration

472
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,279
in Luke chapter number 10, that Jesus says to Martha, she's cumbered about with all

473
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,279
these things.

474
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,619
He says, listen, there's one thing that is needful.

475
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:10,839
You can do a whole lot for God after you spend time with God, amen?

476
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,539
But don't try to neglect that time with God and say, I'm just going to get busy doing

477
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,479
this stuff and I'm going to be busy and busy and busy and busy in all this activity and

478
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,679
I think that I'm some spiritual giant.

479
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,919
No, we need to recognize that activity does not equal spirituality.

480
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,479
It does not replace, it does not substitute spirituality.

481
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,239
Can I say this number three tonight?

482
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,959
Doctrine matters.

483
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,039
Doctrine matters.

484
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,399
We live in a time today in our era of church history where so many people are so concerned

485
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,359
about unity and they think that if they could just set aside some differences and just kind

486
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:54,119
of be passive with regard to doctrinal matters, that they could somehow have this unity, this

487
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,919
ecumenical type of approach to ministry.

488
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:03,239
And I want you to know this evening that doctrine matters.

489
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,359
How are we to walk together if we're not in agreement, right?

490
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,399
Is that not what the minor prophet asks us, that question?

491
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:15,239
And we find this evening that as we look at the various texts of Scripture here in Revelation

492
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:21,359
chapter 2 and verse number 15, notice what the Bible says here in Revelation chapter

493
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,319
2 and verse 14, he says, I have a few things against thee.

494
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:30,439
In verse number 15 he says, so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,

495
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:35,239
which thing I hate.

496
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,599
This is not John saying I hate this.

497
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,639
This is not Paul.

498
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:44,599
This is the Lord Jesus Christ, God, the amen, the one that what he says is true.

499
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,759
And he says, you have this doctrine, there's some people there that are holding to this

500
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,919
doctrine and I hate that.

501
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:51,919
Why?

502
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,199
Because it's not sound doctrine.

503
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:57,279
We find that here, we see it in Revelation 2 and verse 15.

504
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,839
Notice in chapter number 2, here as we continue to go forward in this chapter, notice in verse

505
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,919
number 20, notwithstanding, now he's talking to the church in Thyatira, I have a few things

506
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,659
against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess,

507
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:15,779
to teach and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed

508
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:16,779
unto idols.

509
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,819
God says, listen, I'm not, I'm not pleased with this.

510
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:24,579
In Revelation chapter 3, as he's talking to the church in Sardis, in verse number 3, he

511
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:30,379
says, remember therefore, notice what he says to them, how thou hast received and heard

512
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:33,259
and hold fast.

513
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,419
Jude will write in that short epistle and he says that we're to earnestly contend for

514
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,579
the faith that was once delivered to the saints.

515
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:48,459
The reality is that God has given us sound doctrine in his word and doctrine matters.

516
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,579
We must be people of the Bible.

517
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,259
I had a conversation with someone yesterday as I was out doing some visitation and I,

518
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:00,619
a guy was out in his yard and he began to chat with me and I had this conversation with

519
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,499
him and I asked him if he had a church that he attended.

520
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,779
He said, oh yeah, and he began to share some things about the church and I asked him if

521
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,379
he knew for sure that heaven was his home and he said, oh, I know who died for me and

522
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,739
I've trusted Christ as my Savior and it was exciting to hear that.

523
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:16,239
But then he began to tell me about being part of a church and he's been a part of this church

524
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:22,939
for decades and they're basically, how I would describe it, is they're apostate.

525
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:26,619
He said, I go to a church that doesn't believe the book anymore.

526
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:29,339
That's what he said.

527
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,539
He said, it's so hard for me.

528
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:41,859
He's got a really close relationship with the pastor and he's torn over what to do.

529
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,019
Doctrine matters.

530
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,859
It matters.

531
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:53,379
We find that Paul says to Titus, flip over very quickly in Titus chapter 1 and notice

532
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:58,019
as Paul is instructing, he refers to Titus just as he does to Timothy as being his son

533
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:04,019
in the faith and we find that in Titus chapter 1 and 2, in verse 5 of chapter 1, God gives

534
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,779
us specifically the purpose in which Titus was left in Crete.

535
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,979
The Bible says in Titus 1 and verse 5, for this cause left I thee in Crete that thou

536
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:17,059
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as

537
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,579
I had appointed thee.

538
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:24,399
But then notice the references in verse number 9, holding fast the faithful word as he hath

539
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:31,239
been taught that he may be able, notice, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince

540
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,999
the gainsayers.

541
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:38,079
Notice with me in verse number 13, this witness is true, wherefore rebuke them sharply that

542
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,119
they may be, notice what it says, sound in the faith.

543
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,799
In chapter 2 and verse number 1, Paul says this to Titus, he says, but speak thou the

544
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,519
things which become sound doctrine.

545
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,999
He speaks to Timothy about sound doctrine.

546
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,479
Doctrine matters this evening.

547
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:03,079
The reality is that we ought to be able to take our Bibles and prove why we believe the

548
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,479
things that we believe and we ought to be able to compare Scripture with Scripture.

549
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:14,159
The reality is that if someone wants to come in and just argue and they don't have an agreement

550
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,639
that they're going to agree with God and with his word and they're just going to attack,

551
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:22,479
attack, attack, well that's a different kind of a situation.

552
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:26,399
I sat in my office on Friday and someone began to ask questions as we're having this

553
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,119
discipleship and all kinds of questions, I love questions, they're wonderful.

554
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,319
Man, we were all over the Bible and the questions that we were dealing with weren't even part

555
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,879
of the subject matter for the discipleship class, but what about this and what about

556
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:40,879
that?

557
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:43,199
Yeah, look, let's look over here at this passage, let's look at this passage, here's what the

558
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,719
Bible says here.

559
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,719
Doctrine matters.

560
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,479
It's important for us to understand that.

561
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:52,599
Number four, separation is necessary.

562
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,599
Separation is necessary.

563
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,839
In Revelation 2, as the Lord is speaking here to the church at Pergamos in verse number

564
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,839
13, he says, I know thy works and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seed is, and

565
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,759
thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith, even in those days where Antipas

566
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,999
was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth.

567
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,199
Verse number 15, notice here, it says, so that has that we read it just a moment ago,

568
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,879
hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

569
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:22,879
So what does he tell him?

570
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:23,879
What's the remedy?

571
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:24,879
Repent.

572
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:25,879
Repent.

573
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:29,959
We see it in verse 16, listen, you need to change course.

574
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,919
There are times in which you need to separate from someone.

575
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,039
In verse number 24, as he's talking, speaking here to the church in Thyatira, he says this,

576
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,239
but unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine and which

577
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:47,879
have not known the depths of Satan as they speak, I will put upon you none other burden.

578
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,159
And so there were some that didn't have the doctrine that is spoken of there in Thyatira,

579
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,279
speaking of Jezebel the prophetess and all that's going on there in those preceding verses

580
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,539
that we spoke of.

581
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:04,319
And we find this evening that there are times in which separation is necessary.

582
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,599
Can I remind you of 2 Corinthians chapter number 6, where the Bible says, what concord

583
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:13,319
hath Christ with Belial, light with darkness, so on and so forth, and he comes to verse

584
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:20,679
17 and he says, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

585
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,679
You know what I've learned in life?

586
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,919
More than me having to separate from someone else, if I live godly, if I live by the book

587
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,639
and I do what I'm supposed to do, they're going to separate from me.

588
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:35,839
You know why?

589
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,839
The light reproves their wickedness.

590
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,839
Amen.

591
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,639
That's how it works.

592
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:46,539
You walk in the light, you live the life that you're supposed to live, and all of a sudden

593
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,679
those people that you used to run with and all that kind of thing, they separate from

594
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,939
you because they don't want to, because you reproved their wicked behavior with your testimony.

595
00:28:57,939 --> 00:29:02,919
Here we find this evening that not only personal separation, but even at times ecclesiastical

596
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,359
separation, church.

597
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:11,319
Listen, why do we not go and hold hands with certain denominations, certain groups of people?

598
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:16,239
Listen, you're never going to come in here, as long as I'm the pastor of this church,

599
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:21,239
you're never going to come in here and find people on this platform that are Catholic

600
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,239
and a Presbyterian and a what, why?

601
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:26,639
Because there's ecclesiastical separation.

602
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,319
We don't agree.

603
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,679
They don't believe the book the way that we believe the book.

604
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,359
And so therefore, listen, I don't believe some of what they teach.

605
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,479
I believe that there's only one way to heaven.

606
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,479
Amen.

607
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,479
I don't believe there's a purgatory.

608
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,479
I don't believe, why?

609
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:41,639
I don't believe the Bible.

610
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:45,639
And so sometimes there's not only personal separation, but there's church separation.

611
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,359
Say, I can't, we can't join together.

612
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,399
We can't yoke together because there's differences.

613
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,159
And if the trumpet doesn't sound properly, the people don't know how to respond.

614
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,519
It's an Old Testament truth.

615
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,039
And all of a sudden, even if you're, listen, I understand some of the benefits of Billy

616
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,759
Graham's ministry, but Billy Graham started doing some of that ecumenical nonsense.

617
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,439
And all of a sudden, there was an uncertain sound, why?

618
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:17,359
Because what he was preaching about salvation differed from what the other people on the

619
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,039
platform preached about salvation.

620
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,399
They believed you could go to heaven by the sacraments.

621
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:27,599
That's not what the Bible teaches, right?

622
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,119
And so all of a sudden, because of joining together, you send an uncertain sound.

623
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,199
You say, yeah, but we filled up a stadium.

624
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:43,079
But there's a measure of confusion because of that ecumenical joining.

625
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,119
So at times, we got to separate.

626
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:53,479
Number five, remain faithful even in times of great difficulty.

627
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,479
Remain faithful.

628
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:59,599
I am resolved, we sang this evening, to start the service.

629
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,199
Revelation 2 and verse number 10, the Bible says to the church in Smyrna, fear none of

630
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,119
those things which thou shalt suffer.

631
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,119
Isn't that interesting?

632
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,879
God tells them they're going to suffer.

633
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:13,719
God tells us in 2 Timothy chapter 3, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

634
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:16,719
shall suffer persecution.

635
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:21,079
And here he tells the church in Smyrna, you're going to suffer.

636
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,319
But he says, fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.

637
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,759
Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried, and ye

638
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,559
shall have tribulation ten days.

639
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:38,119
Notice this, be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

640
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,919
Faithfulness, faithfulness.

641
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:49,119
It's required in a steward that a man be found faithful.

642
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,039
Be faithful even in times of great difficulty.

643
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,679
Be steadfast, 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 58, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

644
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,679
in the work of the Lord.

645
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,679
Why?

646
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,799
For you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

647
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
We just remain faithful.

648
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,639
I was having a conversation with a missionary not long ago, and as you, it wasn't with

649
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,919
Brother Brown, it was with a different missionary, but you heard Brother Brown share some of

650
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,099
his testimony in Sunday school.

651
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:19,199
If you were here last week in Sunday school, you heard him share some of that testimony

652
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:23,759
about how to pray for a missionary effectively, and I appreciate his transparency.

653
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,319
He said this while he was giving that message, he said, listen, there was a season in which

654
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,799
we had great discouragement.

655
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,639
He said, I was talking to a preacher friend, and they said if you leave there tomorrow,

656
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:40,559
you leave Cambodia tomorrow, don't feel like you, you don't have to feel like you'd be

657
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,639
a failure.

658
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,719
And here's what he said back to that man, according to what he said from this pulpit

659
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:49,279
last Sunday morning, if you were here, he said, I don't have to leave Cambodia to feel

660
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,279
like I'm a failure.

661
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,479
What was he saying by that?

662
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:54,479
He already felt like he was a failure.

663
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,479
Discouragement.

664
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:00,519
I had a conversation with another missionary this week after he was here with us, and we

665
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,159
had this conversation about being faithful, and the reality is that sometimes it's a lot

666
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,879
more difficult to be faithful when you don't see results, you don't see things happening.

667
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,879
It's hard to stay faithful.

668
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,359
You can get discouraged.

669
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,799
Give up.

670
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:15,879
Leave the place.

671
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:16,879
Why?

672
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:17,879
Because you're not seeing it.

673
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:21,439
And on the flip side of that, if you're in a place where there's a lot of stuff going

674
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:26,639
on and there's a lot of results, quote-unquote, it might be a little easier to stay faithful

675
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:28,479
in that thing.

676
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:32,559
But God tells us to be faithful, be faithful.

677
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,159
Number six, maintain close fellowship with your Lord.

678
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,319
The church in Ephesus left their first love.

679
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,319
What a sad commentary.

680
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:53,239
We have to cultivate and be purposed about our walk with God.

681
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,399
We have to have that close fellowship.

682
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,939
In Revelation chapter 3, speaking of the church of the Laodiceans, we find that Jesus says

683
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:03,999
to them in verse 15, I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot.

684
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:08,919
I would thou work cold or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,

685
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:13,479
I will spew thee out of thy mouth, out of my mouth.

686
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:16,959
God's saying, listen, you're lukewarm.

687
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:21,759
And we find that as Christ would speak about their condition, they were compromising and

688
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,759
accommodating.

689
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:27,919
We said of the church of the Laodiceans that they were indifferent and apathetic, and the

690
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,739
reality is that their walk, their fellowship with God was not what it should be.

691
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:38,479
We find later in the passage in verse 20 that Jesus is on the outside of the church knocking,

692
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,159
saying, if any man will open, if anyone will hear my voice and open the door, I will come

693
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,199
into him and will sup with him and he with me.

694
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:52,599
I wonder this evening, do we have a plan to grow spiritually?

695
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,519
I remember being in the corporate world and I understand some of those things, been a

696
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,279
number of years now, but I remember having development plans on how you were going to

697
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:08,599
progress in your career and how you were going to grow in your area and so on and so

698
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,959
forth and different classes you could take and better yourself to be better to the company

699
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:18,199
and also to obviously gain value for yourself to the company.

700
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,379
But I wonder this evening, do we have a plan to grow spiritually?

701
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:30,839
Do we consider, do we think about, do we spend time with regard to how our spiritual walk

702
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,519
is?

703
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:39,519
Do we have that time in God's Word each day, that time in prayer each day that's a priority?

704
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,519
Because one thing is needful.

705
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,279
And we find this evening that we must not only have a plan to grow, but we must evaluate

706
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,439
our growth.

707
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:51,919
We must refuse to be comfortable or to be content with where we are.

708
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:58,739
We must continue to press on to grow in a deeper, more intimate walk with our Lord.

709
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,979
I think of Moses and I think of Paul.

710
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:05,979
Both of those men made these statements that they would know God.

711
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:11,499
We begin to think about both of those men making the statements in the time that they

712
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:13,059
did, Exodus 33.

713
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:19,139
You know Moses had spent time with God, I mean on the mount, spent time with God.

714
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:21,559
He'd been in God's presence.

715
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,039
He was there at the burning bush.

716
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,339
He was there and saw all of the amazing miracles of the plagues.

717
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:29,339
He experienced that.

718
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:33,939
He had this closeness with God so much so that he could say to Pharaoh, okay, when I

719
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:37,939
leave I'm going to raise my hand and God's going to, I mean he knew God, but he says

720
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:41,899
in Exodus 33 that he wanted to know God.

721
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:47,579
Paul, in the book of Philippians, he says that I may know Him.

722
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,339
He's in jail ready to face a martyr's death.

723
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,379
He'd walked with God.

724
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:56,139
He'd seen God do amazing things.

725
00:36:56,139 --> 00:37:05,339
He says that I may know Him, that I never get content in my spiritual growth, that I

726
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:13,899
continue to have that thirsting and that hungering because the reality this evening is that as

727
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:21,899
much as you know about God today, He's so far greater than what your mind can even comprehend.

728
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,299
Listen, I look at my own life.

729
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:28,539
I look back 10 years, 20 years in my walk with Christ and listen, if you would have

730
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,779
asked me 20 years ago, is God great, I would have said yes.

731
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:35,379
And I would have had two or three things probably to tell you on why I thought God was great.

732
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:39,379
Now you ask me why God's great, I got a whole lot more things to tell you and I say, listen,

733
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,659
as much as I could agree with the psalmist when the psalmist says I know that the Lord

734
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:48,579
is great and then I say, but His greatness is unsearchable.

735
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:55,659
We keep that desire that we walk with God.

736
00:37:55,659 --> 00:38:03,299
I would say this, number seven to finish, determine to heed God's counsel.

737
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:12,019
The first lesson was that God knows our works and I use that first because to every church

738
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,539
He says I know thy works.

739
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:18,979
The seventh lesson, again I said this morning there could be 30, 40 lessons that we could

740
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:24,539
look at, determine to heed God's counsel, I choose it as the seventh one this evening

741
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:30,579
because also to every church He finishes by saying, he that hath an ear, let him hear

742
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,339
what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

743
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:38,779
At some point we have to determine that we're going to heed God's counsel.

744
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:42,899
We have to acknowledge this evening we need to get our feelings out of the way and not

745
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:47,939
be hurt over our toes being stepped on spiritually so to speak.

746
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,579
Listen conviction's good for us.

747
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,739
It is absolutely good for us.

748
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,159
I don't know about you but all week I was convicted about the message I preached this

749
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,579
morning and then I was convicted again as I preached it this morning.

750
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,459
Who am I living for?

751
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:05,219
Who am I living for?

752
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,539
Conviction's good for us.

753
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:12,379
The problem is that we can get under conviction and we can get so resistant to that thing

754
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:16,059
and say I'm not going to change, I got my feelings hurt and I got white knuckle syndrome

755
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,059
and so on and so forth.

756
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,579
No, we just take heed to God's counsel.

757
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,019
God loves me and that's why He's correcting me.

758
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,659
He's saying take heed.

759
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:29,499
He tells us in Psalm 19 and verse number 11 that it's a benefit for us that as we take

760
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:35,139
heed to His words in them that thy servant is warned.

761
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:41,619
He tells us we're warned and in keeping of them there is great reward.

762
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:46,459
Paul in Colossians 1, he's saying that night and day he's warning everyone.

763
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:47,459
Why?

764
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,459
Why is he warning?

765
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:50,019
Why is the message going forth?

766
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,779
Because he wants to present them perfect or complete knowing that they'll stand before

767
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:58,499
Christ one day.

768
00:39:58,499 --> 00:39:59,619
I was singing this morning.

769
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:06,579
morning, sitting up here on the platform, I was singing that little chorus that some

770
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:13,459
of you might know. I'll say, yes, Lord, yes. As I was singing through that little chorus,

771
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:19,199
as I was spending time in prayer this morning, I thought about what a precious truth it is

772
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:27,659
when God's Spirit speaks to us. We ought to expect it. We ought to long for it. God,

773
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:33,459
what do you have for me? What do you teach in me? What do I need to change in my life?

774
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:38,579
What needs to be altered? Where can I grow? What do I—and God speaks to me. When your

775
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,539
Spirit speaks to me, with my whole heart, I'll agree. It's what the song says. And

776
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:54,059
my answer will be, yes, Lord, yes. You know, God gives us counsel in His Word about every

777
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:02,459
area of life. James 1.22, we're to be doers of the Word, not hearers only. You have relational

778
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:10,219
problems. God's Word gives us counsel for how to deal with that. But will we heed God's

779
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:14,019
counsel? Well, you don't know what they did to us. No, no, no. Will we heed God's counsel?

780
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:20,659
Will we follow God's plan? Will we follow what God said? I'm just not going to do that.

781
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:28,979
What did God say? See, sometimes we can dig our heels in, and we can be so concerned about

782
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:35,979
how we think or what we have experienced, and we don't take heed to God's Word. And

783
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:43,539
yet God so faithfully and graciously gives us counsel. He gives us counsel. He's given

784
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:57,279
to us His Word, and He says, listen, obey. Have you ever read Jeremiah, Isaiah, many

785
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:03,279
of the other prophets as well? But I think about those two prophets, and again many others,

786
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:10,459
how God says, I sent my prophets to you, but you would not hear them. You would not hear

787
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:15,539
them. Did it mean that they didn't hear the words audibly? No, that's not necessarily

788
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:22,059
what it means, because they no doubt heard the words audibly. You remember Ahab's relationship

789
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:28,399
with Micaiah? I don't like that guy. He always prophesies negative about me. They're going

790
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:32,459
to go into battle, and Joshua says, isn't there an actual prophet of God here? You bring

791
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:36,099
all these prophets of Baal, but isn't there a prophet of God? Yeah, but I don't like that

792
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:41,019
guy because he always prophesies negative. He heard what he said, but he didn't heed

793
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:47,459
what he said. There's a difference in hearing and heeding. And He says to every church,

794
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:52,279
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. Why are we

795
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:57,739
hearing it? So that we could apply it, so that we could do it. We could spend the entire,

796
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:03,139
we could spend the next hour talking about all of the areas of life that God gives us

797
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:08,979
counsel for the arena in which you're dealing with and what your troubles are and your situations

798
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:16,899
and God gives counsel. But the question is, will we heed it? Will we heed it? These churches,

799
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:26,219
God loved them. He loves the church. And He loves us so much that He gives us truth, and

800
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,739
He wants us to apply truth so that we could be pleasing in His sight. So that we could

801
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:37,779
accomplish what He intends for us to accomplish. Seven lessons from seven churches. Let's pray.

802
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:42,099
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word and for the

803
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:51,579
truth contained therein. We thank You, God, for the value that You've placed upon the

804
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:59,539
local church. We're thankful for the instruction that You've given. Lord, I pray tonight that

805
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:03,899
You would just help us to be doers of the Word. Help us to take these lessons and apply

806
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:12,299
them in our lives. God, if there's any conviction, I pray that we'd respond in obedience, that

807
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:19,419
we would not be resistant to the moving of Your Spirit, that we would not quench or grieve

808
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:26,019
the Holy Spirit of God. We thank You that You've given us free will. God, I pray that

809
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,179
You'd help us to make the right choice and the right decision that we'd surrender and

810
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:35,419
submit. God, You'd do a work that only You could do. I pray that You'd have Your will

811
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:39,459
and way in these moments of imitation. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

812
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:43,259
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Lennon's going to play quietly on the piano.

813
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:45,339
And as she does, the altar is open.
