00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
the last 11 weeks on Sunday evenings.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.280
Well, 11 weeks of messages,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.860
so not 11 calendar weeks,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.960
but 11 services that we have had a message

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.119
from these seven churches.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.359
And so 11 messages on the seven churches,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.559
and what a blessing to have the opportunity

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.879
to study them and to be encouraged by them,

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.040
to be challenged.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.000
And I am thankful for each of these letters

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.799
and for God preserving his word for us.

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.240
And as I mentioned this morning,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.860
in summary, if you will, I'd like to consider,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.360
I've titled the message this evening,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.799
Seven Lessons from Seven Churches.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.200
I wanna remind you this evening,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.119
as we begin to look at Revelation 2 and 3,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.279
that these are seven local churches.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:49.279
They are churches that existed in the first century.

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:51.840
They are churches in which the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.599
instructs John to write these letters to them.

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:57.279
And we find that these churches

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:59.720
were in existence at that time.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.099
Obviously, there were many more than these seven churches.

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:05.839
There were a lot more churches that were around

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:09.959
that were definitely capable of receiving a letter,

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.480
but these are the seven churches

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.559
that the Lord in his wisdom

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:16.500
chose to have these letters written to.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.180
I believe that these churches are representative

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.480
of all churches throughout the church age.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.000
What do I mean by that?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.239
Well, we find that these churches

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:30.139
are not necessarily representative of a certain section

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.199
or period of time within the broad sense of the church age.

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:37.440
In other words, the first church that is referenced,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.919
the church at Ephesus,

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:41.000
not every church in the first and second

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.680
or however long you wanna divide up the timeline

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.559
were like the church at Ephesus.

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.360
And not every church today,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.580
as we're nearing the end of the church age,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.199
we see the day approaching,

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:54.959
not every church today has to model

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.839
what is said about the church of the Laodiceans.

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.099
I believe that in every era of church history,

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.680
there have been churches that could,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.440
as you evaluate them,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.399
they align with maybe the church at Smyrna

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.539
or they align with the church in Sardis.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.979
And maybe there's an element of this church

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.679
and that church that are combined within the church.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.600
And so there are some that take the approach

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.720
that we're living in the Laodicean period

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.740
of the church age.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.740
And therefore, basically they'd say there's no hope,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.119
we're all just the church of the Laodiceans

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.419
and that's what our lot is and that's what it is.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.720
In fact, many of them that would have that approach

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.660
would say there's not even a hope for revival.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.839
That's a sad outlook, is it not?

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.240
Not only do I not believe that it's biblical,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.960
but the reality is that I believe

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.419
that our God can send revival.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.940
I believe that our God wants to send revival.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.179
I believe that we can be a church,

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.919
as I've mentioned multiple times throughout the series,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.259
that we can be a church that is God honoring,

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.320
that is doing God's work God's way.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.539
And what a blessing.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.580
In Sunday school this morning,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580
I dealt a little bit with the idea of the church

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.860
and what is the church

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.580
and what's the importance of the church.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.220
And those of you that were in Sunday school

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.580
got to hear some of that lesson.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.100
It was very interactive on purpose

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.820
and getting some feedback.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.500
And I mentioned something that happened in 2020.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.860
I did not include this part of it.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.300
I wanted to be able to include it this morning,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.940
but if you were there this evening,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.940
if you were there this morning,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.220
you would be able to connect these dots.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.300
But in 2019, so something very significant happened in 2020.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.220
We know what that was.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.539
It was COVID, all right?

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.320
It is probably etched in our minds forever and ever

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.720
that 2020, someone mentions the year

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.899
and immediately you're gonna think

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.779
you're gonna be reminded of the COVID year.

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.300
And all of the differences and changes

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.020
and all the things that we went through.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.740
And by the way, I hope that we never go through

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.300
something like that again.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.899
And for many of us,

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.240
it was the first time we ever went through it.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.940
I remember sitting around having conversations

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.839
with different people.

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.979
I remember being on calls with lawyers and others.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.179
And there more than one time that a preacher would say,

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.380
they didn't teach us this in Bible college.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.919
And we'd say, that's right, man.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.380
They didn't teach us anything about this

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.860
in Bible college, right?

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.260
But the reality is that

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.220
that was a significant event in 2020.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.059
What I mentioned in Sunday school this morning

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.940
was that in 2020, our government

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.420
and many governments around the world

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.140
began to categorize businesses or institutions.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.140
And they used this word essential.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.940
You obviously remember that.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.779
It's not been that long ago.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.420
And you remember how they would categorize certain things

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.899
as being essential while others were non-essential.

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:48.380
We had it not only for businesses and organizations,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.660
we had it for personnel.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.100
There was essential personnel

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.100
and there was non-essential personnel.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500
And we understand all of that.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.820
We lived through it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.359
And we asked the question in Sunday school this morning,

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:02.260
why is it that the government for the most part

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.859
was willing to say and to look at an establishment

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:10.579
such as a liquor store and say that they're essential,

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:12.559
but yet they would look at the church

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.600
and say that they're non-essential?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.200
That's what happened.

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:20.519
Yeah.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.880
So let me tell you of something that happened in 2019.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.079
We asked the question in Sunday school,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:31.679
why is it that they said that the church was not essential?

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:33.420
There were some answers that were provided.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.959
And really, we said that really what has to happen

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.779
is we as the people of God have to stand up

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.440
and take responsibility that we stopped for decades,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.440
for generations, making the church vital.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.600
We'll skip church for all sorts of things.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.959
So through our negligence to church

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:55.839
and our behavior saying that church isn't essential,

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.640
though we wouldn't use those words,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.519
we're communicating to a lost world

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.359
that the church really isn't essential.

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:05.399
So in 2019, Barna did a study.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.279
And some of you are familiar with Barna studies,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.600
the Barna group, so on and so forth.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.799
And I understand statistics,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.359
they can be kind of skewed and what have you.

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:17.040
But I'm just gonna tell you what the study revealed in 2019.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.119
So this is prior to COVID.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:24.119
In 2019, 44%, that's almost half,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.440
44% of Americans that claimed to be Christian.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.239
Now understand that's a broad category, okay?

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:34.079
I get it.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.720
I understand that there are people

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.859
that claim to be Christian,

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:38.839
but that doesn't truly mean they're born again.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.359
I understand all of that.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:44.160
But these are at least people that said, I'm a Christian.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.200
They identified with that as they took this survey.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.239
And of those that claim to be Christians,

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:55.920
44% of them said church is not essential.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
44% said church is not essential.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.880
Now that was answering a survey.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.239
I wonder what the percentage is

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:14.119
of those that would never actually say the words,

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:17.500
but their behavior says church is not essential.

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:21.059
Do you understand what I'm saying this evening?

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:24.079
The Lord Jesus Christ gave to us in his word,

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.119
and we dealt with this in Sunday school a bit,

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:29.559
and it segues with the message this evening.

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:31.480
He revealed to us in his word,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.600
what the value or the worth of the church is.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.119
The Bible tells us that Jesus said,

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.279
after he asked the question to the disciples,

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.839
whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.679
Whom say ye that I am?

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.600
We find that Jesus then makes this great declaration,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.959
I will build my church.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.420
And he gives to us, he reveals to us

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.279
in that single statement,

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:58.640
the fact that he is going to be actively engaged

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.160
in working and building his church.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.220
It is his church.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.279
It's not my church.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.640
It's not our church.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.720
It is his church.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.079
I understand sometimes we use the vernacular,

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:11.100
and we'll use the phraseology that this is my church,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.720
or will you come to my church or our church.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.160
But I think for the most part,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.160
we understand biblically that Christ is the head

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.040
of the church.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.200
And when we use that terminology,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.600
we're not claiming that we're the head of it.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.440
We're simply saying this is the church that I'm part of.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:32.000
But we understand that Jesus said I will build my church.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.359
Then in Acts 20 and verse 28,

00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:37.979
and also in Ephesians five and verse 25,

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:41.919
the Bible tells us that Christ valued the church so much

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.880
that he gave his life for it.

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.440
He bought the church with his own blood,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.640
according to Acts 20 and verse 28.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.059
So how do we value something?

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:56.440
How do we set a value or a worth on something?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.659
How vital is church to us?

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:03.500
Well, we understand how important church is to God.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.539
Church is not man's idea.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.539
Church is God's idea.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.460
Amen?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.059
It's not man's idea.

00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:13.419
Church didn't begin with man having this idea

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:16.059
that we're going to have this thing called.

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.140
No, God, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.179
he's the one that instituted,

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:23.260
he's the one that instructed,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.580
and he gives to us the local church,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.520
and what a blessing.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:30.559
So these seven churches that are written to,

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:33.599
that are given these chapters,

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:34.719
Revelation two and three,

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.859
as we have the opportunity to go through them,

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:39.039
we see that these are churches,

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:44.039
why does God even care to write to these churches?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.400
Because he loves the church.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.880
Because he loves the church.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.080
And I wonder this evening,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.280
I hope tonight that if we were to take a survey

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.760
amongst those that are present,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.159
that the numbers would be nowhere near.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.359
or what the Barna study was in 2019.

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:08.039
But does it not reveal to you an element this evening

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:11.639
as to why the government would say in 2020

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.679
that the church is not essential

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.759
if 44% of those that claim to be Christians in 2019

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.319
said the church is not essential?

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:23.399
What does it mean when they say the church is not essential?

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:27.319
Well, basically, if it fits my schedule, I'll attend.

00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:29.879
If nothing else interferes, I'll attend.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.199
If something else comes up that's more important

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.279
that takes precedence,

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.679
then, well, you know, it's not really important.

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:39.239
That's a bad perspective

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:42.499
because the church is the bride of Christ.

00:10:42.499 --> 00:10:43.339
Amen?

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:45.239
Is that biblically that we'll study

00:10:45.239 --> 00:10:46.579
as we get through the book of Revelation?

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.679
It's gonna be months and months and months from now.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:51.639
We talk about the marriage supper of the Lamb.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:54.039
The church is the bride of Christ.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:59.599
God has no other option, quote unquote,

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.159
for this era.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.399
It's the church.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.639
It's the church.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:04.919
There's no backup plan.

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:05.999
There's no plan B.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.359
There's the church.

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:11.159
And why is it that he writes to these churches

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:13.359
is because he loves them,

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:17.319
because he's concerned about what's going on in the churches.

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:20.079
He's actively involved in the churches,

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:24.479
and he sees, and so why does God take the time to write

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:28.599
and to commend and also to correct and to give instruction?

00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:29.439
Why?

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.239
Because he loves the church.

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:34.599
And tonight, if we could just grasp that truth,

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:36.319
that we could understand this evening

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:39.439
that God gives us these truths in his word

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:40.559
because he loves us,

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:44.399
because he wants us to know the right way and the best way,

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.599
and he wants us to know how that we're to behave

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:47.839
and how that we're to live,

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.479
and he wants us to have that same level

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:54.159
of valuing the church like he does.

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:57.639
The church is known as the body of Christ.

00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:01.279
The bride of Christ, but also the body of Christ.

00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:04.999
I don't know how many of us this evening,

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:07.679
thinking about the picture of the body of Christ,

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:08.959
I don't think any of us would say,

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.159
you know, go ahead and cut my right arm off,

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:13.359
I'm gonna do without it.

00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:17.919
You'd be crazy, right?

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.439
What about the body of Christ?

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:22.519
How do we function?

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:28.519
How do we fulfill the purpose that God has for us?

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:31.439
Does that make sense to you this evening?

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:34.999
I read years ago, and I don't remember the exact source,

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:36.399
it just came to my mind right now

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.839
of the fact that I read this

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.599
and I didn't prepare to say this,

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:41.439
so I don't have the source in my notes,

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:43.439
but I read years ago that there were churches

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:45.759
prior to the time of electricity.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:47.719
We come in here, we have central air conditioning,

00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:49.359
we have lights that turn on with a switch

00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:50.479
and so on and so forth.

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.759
Every now and then we get a power outage

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:56.799
and it's like, what are we gonna do, right?

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.759
And I say, folks on livestream,

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:00.639
we got a serious thunderstorm coming through,

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:03.639
you might lose us, but we're gonna just keep having church.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.639
But I read this account prior to the time

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:11.239
in which electricity was available and prevalent,

00:13:11.239 --> 00:13:13.839
where in the church house, an individual went in

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.199
and they saw these pews and on the end of each pew,

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:19.359
there was a hook on the end that was about this high.

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:23.999
And they walked into the church and it had been years later

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:25.959
and they were not familiar with the era

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:27.479
and what was going on and they said,

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:28.359
what are these about?

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:30.159
That's a valid question, is it not?

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:33.119
And the individual said, well, here's how it worked

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:35.639
prior to electricity, when you came into church,

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.999
you would hang your lantern on the hook.

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:44.439
And he went on to say this,

00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:48.399
when people were missing, it really affected the whole.

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.559
Why?

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.399
Well, because you sit over there by yourself

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:57.319
and it's only as bright as your one lantern produces light.

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:01.199
But when everyone's in their place and all the lanterns are,

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:05.399
now all of a sudden the whole building is illuminated.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:10.279
I thought, man, that's powerful, that's powerful.

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:17.119
This evening, the church is the body of Christ,

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.039
it's the bride of Christ.

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:22.039
The church is precious.

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.319
I don't know if you've ever been in a place

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.399
where there's no local church.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.999
I mean, a good local church.

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:29.119
I live in a place in Nevada

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.519
where there was no good local church,

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:31.919
70 miles from where we live.

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:34.719
There was nowhere, no good local church.

00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:37.079
Went to the best one we could go to.

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:38.359
I talked to Dean this afternoon

00:14:38.359 --> 00:14:39.879
after the Sunday school lesson, he came to me

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.319
and he said, you know, I was in Colorado

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:42.959
working for a number of years.

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:45.719
And for those, I think he said it was 11 years

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.799
that he was working there.

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.199
From this date to this date

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:52.279
is when he worked out in Colorado.

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:56.799
And so for all those months, five months out of the year,

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:58.279
he said the closest good church

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.519
was 150 miles away, one direction.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:02.919
Can you imagine?

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:07.919
You know how difficult that is for your Christian life,

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:09.279
your Christian walk?

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.479
You can't come to church.

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:13.159
We choose not to go to church

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:15.619
for certain reasons, whatever they are,

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.359
but then you talk to people that are not able

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:19.639
to go to church and how they desperately wish

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.079
they could be in church.

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:23.999
Someone has wisely said over the years

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:25.479
and they've applied it to a number of things.

00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:27.499
Oftentimes we don't know,

00:15:27.499 --> 00:15:29.959
we don't appreciate something the way that we should

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.659
until we no longer have it.

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:34.859
And this evening, as we look at these seven lessons

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:37.139
from seven churches, we've dealt with 11 weeks

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.579
of going through these.

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:41.419
So I'm not gonna belabor any of the points specifically,

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.079
but I wanna share seven thoughts with you.

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:46.719
Number one, God knows our works.

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:49.639
To every single church, all seven churches,

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:54.639
Jesus says, I know thy works.

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.919
It reveals to us his omniscience.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:59.159
It reveals to us that he knows everything.

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:03.319
He knows not only our, excuse me,

00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:07.519
not only our work, but our motive behind our work.

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.399
He knows why we're doing it.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.719
And we find that in each of these letters,

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:16.719
he says to these churches, I know thy works.

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:18.599
I wonder this evening, as we consider

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:22.079
just that simple truth that's revealed

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.859
to each of these seven churches,

00:16:23.859 --> 00:16:26.879
I wonder if we were in a position

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:28.959
as these churches are this evening

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.439
that had these letters written,

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:33.559
I wonder tonight if God were to write a letter

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.279
about us as a local church,

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.719
Fellowship Baptist Church in Oakton, Virginia,

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:40.599
or I wonder if God were to give some level

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:44.639
of writing with regard to our lives as individuals,

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:47.239
what would God say about our works?

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.799
Because God knows our works.

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:52.599
And I understand that even as the church

00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:56.159
of the Laodiceans, oftentimes we have a perspective

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.599
and it can be skewed.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.879
God knows our works.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.399
Let me say this, number two,

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:08.259
activity doesn't equal spirituality.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:14.339
Activity doesn't equal spirituality.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.959
There's a number of these churches

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.199
as we studied through them, we said this,

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:19.579
Ephesus is a great example,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.579
there's others that are great examples as well.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.599
We said this, if I move to a new town,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.139
if I move to a new location and I was looking for a church,

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:29.879
man, that church hits all the things that I'm looking for.

00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:31.679
They got this program and that program

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:32.799
and they got this thing going on

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:36.199
and they got activity after activity after activity.

00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:39.279
But Jesus says to the church there in Ephesus,

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:42.039
you've left your first love.

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:44.939
We find here this evening in chapter number three

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.639
with the church in Sardis, he says to them,

00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:50.159
I know thy works, he says this in verse number one

00:17:50.159 --> 00:17:52.559
at the end of the verse, that thou hast a name

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:55.819
that thou livest, noticed, and are dead.

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:02.359
Activity can never be a substitute for spirituality.

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:05.659
Activity doesn't equal spirituality.

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:08.319
There's some times in which we wanna be busy, busy, busy,

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:12.839
busy, busy, but we're neglecting our time with God.

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:16.039
We're neglecting that true spiritual aspect

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:19.299
of our walk with God and our growth in Christ

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.839
and it's absolutely important this evening

00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:23.559
that we recognize that activity

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:25.919
doesn't substitute for spirituality,

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:28.099
it does not equal spirituality.

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:31.779
You can be busy, but not be spiritual.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
You can be busy, but not doing the most important thing.

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:39.159
Do you remember this?

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:42.039
We looked at this here in some of these churches.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:45.199
I just referenced the church in Sardis there

00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:47.559
in chapter number two to the church at Ephesus

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:49.319
and nevertheless in verse four, I have somewhat against thee

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:51.039
because thou hast left thy first love,

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:53.659
but I wanna remind you of Mary and Martha.

00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:55.039
You're familiar with it, no doubt,

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.679
Luke chapter number 10,

00:18:56.679 --> 00:18:58.799
and it's a familiar passage of scripture.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.919
In Luke chapter number 10,

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:02.599
we find that they're gathered together here

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:06.599
and Jesus is there and we find that the Bible tells us

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:09.239
in Luke chapter 10, beginning in verse number 38,

00:19:09.239 --> 00:19:11.159
now it came to pass as they went

00:19:11.159 --> 00:19:13.799
that he, Christ, entered into a certain village

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:16.479
and a certain woman named Martha received him

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:19.719
into her house and she had a sister called Mary,

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:22.119
which also, notice what the Bible says of Mary,

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:26.500
sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.940
She was sitting at the feet of Christ.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.099
She's hearing the word.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.739
We find that verse 40 says,

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:38.259
but Martha was cumbered about much serving.

00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:39.099
You know what she was doing?

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.519
She was busy, she was active.

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:44.139
She was doing, doing, doing, right?

00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:46.819
And the Bible says, and came to him, came to Jesus,

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:48.899
and said, Lord, dost thou not care

00:19:48.899 --> 00:19:52.000
that my sister hath left me to serve alone?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.179
Bid her therefore that she help me.

00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:56.619
Jesus answered and said unto her,

00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:58.859
I can almost hear the voice of Christ

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:00.139
when I read this verse.

00:20:00.139 --> 00:20:05.079
I don't think Christ was rebuking her in a very stern way.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:13.779
I think Jesus Christ, in a very compassionate tone, said, Martha, Martha, Martha, I mean

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:20.619
just very compassionately, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:24.739
But then what does he say in verse number 42?

00:20:24.739 --> 00:20:32.959
But one thing is needful, one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part which

00:20:32.959 --> 00:20:36.899
shall not be taken away from her.

00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:38.059
Does it mean that we don't serve?

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:42.079
No, it doesn't mean that we don't serve, but you better get it in the right order.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.039
You can't serve in your own power.

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:45.239
You need the power of Christ.

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:47.599
You need the grace of God.

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:49.759
We need to be good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:51.959
You need his enabling and his empowerment.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:55.879
And we understand this evening that when we look at this passage in this illustration

00:20:55.879 --> 00:21:00.279
in Luke chapter number 10, that Jesus says to Martha, she's cumbered about with all

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:01.279
these things.

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:04.619
He says, listen, there's one thing that is needful.

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:10.839
You can do a whole lot for God after you spend time with God, amen?

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:14.539
But don't try to neglect that time with God and say, I'm just going to get busy doing

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:19.479
this stuff and I'm going to be busy and busy and busy and busy in all this activity and

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:21.679
I think that I'm some spiritual giant.

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:27.919
No, we need to recognize that activity does not equal spirituality.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:32.479
It does not replace, it does not substitute spirituality.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:34.239
Can I say this number three tonight?

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:35.959
Doctrine matters.

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:37.039
Doctrine matters.

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:42.399
We live in a time today in our era of church history where so many people are so concerned

00:21:42.399 --> 00:21:47.359
about unity and they think that if they could just set aside some differences and just kind

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:54.119
of be passive with regard to doctrinal matters, that they could somehow have this unity, this

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:56.919
ecumenical type of approach to ministry.

00:21:56.919 --> 00:22:03.239
And I want you to know this evening that doctrine matters.

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:06.359
How are we to walk together if we're not in agreement, right?

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:10.399
Is that not what the minor prophet asks us, that question?

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:15.239
And we find this evening that as we look at the various texts of Scripture here in Revelation

00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:21.359
chapter 2 and verse number 15, notice what the Bible says here in Revelation chapter

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:24.319
2 and verse 14, he says, I have a few things against thee.

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:30.439
In verse number 15 he says, so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans,

00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:35.239
which thing I hate.

00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:37.599
This is not John saying I hate this.

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:38.639
This is not Paul.

00:22:38.639 --> 00:22:44.599
This is the Lord Jesus Christ, God, the amen, the one that what he says is true.

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:48.759
And he says, you have this doctrine, there's some people there that are holding to this

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:50.919
doctrine and I hate that.

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:51.919
Why?

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.199
Because it's not sound doctrine.

00:22:54.199 --> 00:22:57.279
We find that here, we see it in Revelation 2 and verse 15.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:02.839
Notice in chapter number 2, here as we continue to go forward in this chapter, notice in verse

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:06.919
number 20, notwithstanding, now he's talking to the church in Thyatira, I have a few things

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:11.659
against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess,

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:15.779
to teach and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:16.779
unto idols.

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:19.819
God says, listen, I'm not, I'm not pleased with this.

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:24.579
In Revelation chapter 3, as he's talking to the church in Sardis, in verse number 3, he

00:23:24.579 --> 00:23:30.379
says, remember therefore, notice what he says to them, how thou hast received and heard

00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:33.259
and hold fast.

00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:37.419
Jude will write in that short epistle and he says that we're to earnestly contend for

00:23:37.419 --> 00:23:41.579
the faith that was once delivered to the saints.

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:48.459
The reality is that God has given us sound doctrine in his word and doctrine matters.

00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:50.579
We must be people of the Bible.

00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:56.259
I had a conversation with someone yesterday as I was out doing some visitation and I,

00:23:56.259 --> 00:24:00.619
a guy was out in his yard and he began to chat with me and I had this conversation with

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:02.499
him and I asked him if he had a church that he attended.

00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:05.779
He said, oh yeah, and he began to share some things about the church and I asked him if

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:09.379
he knew for sure that heaven was his home and he said, oh, I know who died for me and

00:24:09.379 --> 00:24:12.739
I've trusted Christ as my Savior and it was exciting to hear that.

00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:16.239
But then he began to tell me about being part of a church and he's been a part of this church

00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:22.939
for decades and they're basically, how I would describe it, is they're apostate.

00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:26.619
He said, I go to a church that doesn't believe the book anymore.

00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:29.339
That's what he said.

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:31.539
He said, it's so hard for me.

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:41.859
He's got a really close relationship with the pastor and he's torn over what to do.

00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:46.019
Doctrine matters.

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:47.859
It matters.

00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:53.379
We find that Paul says to Titus, flip over very quickly in Titus chapter 1 and notice

00:24:53.379 --> 00:24:58.019
as Paul is instructing, he refers to Titus just as he does to Timothy as being his son

00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:04.019
in the faith and we find that in Titus chapter 1 and 2, in verse 5 of chapter 1, God gives

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:08.779
us specifically the purpose in which Titus was left in Crete.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:12.979
The Bible says in Titus 1 and verse 5, for this cause left I thee in Crete that thou

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:17.059
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:18.579
I had appointed thee.

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:24.399
But then notice the references in verse number 9, holding fast the faithful word as he hath

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:31.239
been taught that he may be able, notice, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince

00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:32.999
the gainsayers.

00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:38.079
Notice with me in verse number 13, this witness is true, wherefore rebuke them sharply that

00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:42.119
they may be, notice what it says, sound in the faith.

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:46.799
In chapter 2 and verse number 1, Paul says this to Titus, he says, but speak thou the

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:51.519
things which become sound doctrine.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:53.999
He speaks to Timothy about sound doctrine.

00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:57.479
Doctrine matters this evening.

00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:03.079
The reality is that we ought to be able to take our Bibles and prove why we believe the

00:26:03.079 --> 00:26:07.479
things that we believe and we ought to be able to compare Scripture with Scripture.

00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:14.159
The reality is that if someone wants to come in and just argue and they don't have an agreement

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:18.639
that they're going to agree with God and with his word and they're just going to attack,

00:26:18.639 --> 00:26:22.479
attack, attack, well that's a different kind of a situation.

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:26.399
I sat in my office on Friday and someone began to ask questions as we're having this

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:30.119
discipleship and all kinds of questions, I love questions, they're wonderful.

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:35.319
Man, we were all over the Bible and the questions that we were dealing with weren't even part

00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:39.879
of the subject matter for the discipleship class, but what about this and what about

00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:40.879
that?

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:43.199
Yeah, look, let's look over here at this passage, let's look at this passage, here's what the

00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:44.719
Bible says here.

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:45.719
Doctrine matters.

00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:48.479
It's important for us to understand that.

00:26:48.479 --> 00:26:52.599
Number four, separation is necessary.

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:53.599
Separation is necessary.

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:58.839
In Revelation 2, as the Lord is speaking here to the church at Pergamos in verse number

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:04.839
13, he says, I know thy works and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seed is, and

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:09.759
thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith, even in those days where Antipas

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:13.999
was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth.

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:18.199
Verse number 15, notice here, it says, so that has that we read it just a moment ago,

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:21.879
hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:22.879
So what does he tell him?

00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:23.879
What's the remedy?

00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:24.879
Repent.

00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:25.879
Repent.

00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:29.959
We see it in verse 16, listen, you need to change course.

00:27:29.959 --> 00:27:32.919
There are times in which you need to separate from someone.

00:27:32.919 --> 00:27:38.039
In verse number 24, as he's talking, speaking here to the church in Thyatira, he says this,

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:43.239
but unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine and which

00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:47.879
have not known the depths of Satan as they speak, I will put upon you none other burden.

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:53.159
And so there were some that didn't have the doctrine that is spoken of there in Thyatira,

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:57.279
speaking of Jezebel the prophetess and all that's going on there in those preceding verses

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.539
that we spoke of.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:04.319
And we find this evening that there are times in which separation is necessary.

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:08.599
Can I remind you of 2 Corinthians chapter number 6, where the Bible says, what concord

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:13.319
hath Christ with Belial, light with darkness, so on and so forth, and he comes to verse

00:28:13.319 --> 00:28:20.679
17 and he says, come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:23.679
You know what I've learned in life?

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:29.919
More than me having to separate from someone else, if I live godly, if I live by the book

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:34.639
and I do what I'm supposed to do, they're going to separate from me.

00:28:34.639 --> 00:28:35.839
You know why?

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.839
The light reproves their wickedness.

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:38.839
Amen.

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:41.639
That's how it works.

00:28:41.639 --> 00:28:46.539
You walk in the light, you live the life that you're supposed to live, and all of a sudden

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:50.679
those people that you used to run with and all that kind of thing, they separate from

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:57.939
you because they don't want to, because you reproved their wicked behavior with your testimony.

00:28:57.939 --> 00:29:02.919
Here we find this evening that not only personal separation, but even at times ecclesiastical

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:04.359
separation, church.

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:11.319
Listen, why do we not go and hold hands with certain denominations, certain groups of people?

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:16.239
Listen, you're never going to come in here, as long as I'm the pastor of this church,

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:21.239
you're never going to come in here and find people on this platform that are Catholic

00:29:21.239 --> 00:29:23.239
and a Presbyterian and a what, why?

00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:26.639
Because there's ecclesiastical separation.

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:28.319
We don't agree.

00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:31.679
They don't believe the book the way that we believe the book.

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:35.359
And so therefore, listen, I don't believe some of what they teach.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:37.479
I believe that there's only one way to heaven.

00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:38.479
Amen.

00:29:38.479 --> 00:29:39.479
I don't believe there's a purgatory.

00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:40.479
I don't believe, why?

00:29:40.639 --> 00:29:41.639
I don't believe the Bible.

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:45.639
And so sometimes there's not only personal separation, but there's church separation.

00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:48.359
Say, I can't, we can't join together.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:52.399
We can't yoke together because there's differences.

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:58.159
And if the trumpet doesn't sound properly, the people don't know how to respond.

00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.519
It's an Old Testament truth.

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:05.039
And all of a sudden, even if you're, listen, I understand some of the benefits of Billy

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:10.759
Graham's ministry, but Billy Graham started doing some of that ecumenical nonsense.

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:13.439
And all of a sudden, there was an uncertain sound, why?

00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:17.359
Because what he was preaching about salvation differed from what the other people on the

00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:21.039
platform preached about salvation.

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:23.399
They believed you could go to heaven by the sacraments.

00:30:23.399 --> 00:30:27.599
That's not what the Bible teaches, right?

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:33.119
And so all of a sudden, because of joining together, you send an uncertain sound.

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:37.199
You say, yeah, but we filled up a stadium.

00:30:37.199 --> 00:30:43.079
But there's a measure of confusion because of that ecumenical joining.

00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:46.119
So at times, we got to separate.

00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:53.479
Number five, remain faithful even in times of great difficulty.

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:54.479
Remain faithful.

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:59.599
I am resolved, we sang this evening, to start the service.

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:03.199
Revelation 2 and verse number 10, the Bible says to the church in Smyrna, fear none of

00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:06.119
those things which thou shalt suffer.

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:07.119
Isn't that interesting?

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:09.879
God tells them they're going to suffer.

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:13.719
God tells us in 2 Timothy chapter 3, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus

00:31:13.719 --> 00:31:16.719
shall suffer persecution.

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:21.079
And here he tells the church in Smyrna, you're going to suffer.

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:24.319
But he says, fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:28.759
Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried, and ye

00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:30.559
shall have tribulation ten days.

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:38.119
Notice this, be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:40.919
Faithfulness, faithfulness.

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:49.119
It's required in a steward that a man be found faithful.

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:53.039
Be faithful even in times of great difficulty.

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:57.679
Be steadfast, 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 58, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding

00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:58.679
in the work of the Lord.

00:31:58.679 --> 00:31:59.679
Why?

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:02.799
For you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:04.799
We just remain faithful.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:10.639
I was having a conversation with a missionary not long ago, and as you, it wasn't with

00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:13.919
Brother Brown, it was with a different missionary, but you heard Brother Brown share some of

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:16.099
his testimony in Sunday school.

00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:19.199
If you were here last week in Sunday school, you heard him share some of that testimony

00:32:19.199 --> 00:32:23.759
about how to pray for a missionary effectively, and I appreciate his transparency.

00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:28.319
He said this while he was giving that message, he said, listen, there was a season in which

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:31.799
we had great discouragement.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:36.639
He said, I was talking to a preacher friend, and they said if you leave there tomorrow,

00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:40.559
you leave Cambodia tomorrow, don't feel like you, you don't have to feel like you'd be

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.639
a failure.

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:45.719
And here's what he said back to that man, according to what he said from this pulpit

00:32:45.719 --> 00:32:49.279
last Sunday morning, if you were here, he said, I don't have to leave Cambodia to feel

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:50.279
like I'm a failure.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.479
What was he saying by that?

00:32:51.479 --> 00:32:54.479
He already felt like he was a failure.

00:32:54.479 --> 00:32:55.479
Discouragement.

00:32:55.479 --> 00:33:00.519
I had a conversation with another missionary this week after he was here with us, and we

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:05.159
had this conversation about being faithful, and the reality is that sometimes it's a lot

00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:09.879
more difficult to be faithful when you don't see results, you don't see things happening.

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:11.879
It's hard to stay faithful.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:13.359
You can get discouraged.

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:14.799
Give up.

00:33:14.879 --> 00:33:15.879
Leave the place.

00:33:15.879 --> 00:33:16.879
Why?

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:17.879
Because you're not seeing it.

00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:21.439
And on the flip side of that, if you're in a place where there's a lot of stuff going

00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:26.639
on and there's a lot of results, quote-unquote, it might be a little easier to stay faithful

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:28.479
in that thing.

00:33:28.479 --> 00:33:32.559
But God tells us to be faithful, be faithful.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:38.159
Number six, maintain close fellowship with your Lord.

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:41.319
The church in Ephesus left their first love.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:45.319
What a sad commentary.

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:53.239
We have to cultivate and be purposed about our walk with God.

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:55.399
We have to have that close fellowship.

00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:59.939
In Revelation chapter 3, speaking of the church of the Laodiceans, we find that Jesus says

00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:03.999
to them in verse 15, I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot.

00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:08.919
I would thou work cold or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:13.479
I will spew thee out of thy mouth, out of my mouth.

00:34:13.479 --> 00:34:16.959
God's saying, listen, you're lukewarm.

00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:21.759
And we find that as Christ would speak about their condition, they were compromising and

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:22.759
accommodating.

00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:27.919
We said of the church of the Laodiceans that they were indifferent and apathetic, and the

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:32.739
reality is that their walk, their fellowship with God was not what it should be.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:38.479
We find later in the passage in verse 20 that Jesus is on the outside of the church knocking,

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:42.159
saying, if any man will open, if anyone will hear my voice and open the door, I will come

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.199
into him and will sup with him and he with me.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:52.599
I wonder this evening, do we have a plan to grow spiritually?

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:57.519
I remember being in the corporate world and I understand some of those things, been a

00:34:57.519 --> 00:35:02.279
number of years now, but I remember having development plans on how you were going to

00:35:02.279 --> 00:35:08.599
progress in your career and how you were going to grow in your area and so on and so

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:12.959
forth and different classes you could take and better yourself to be better to the company

00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:18.199
and also to obviously gain value for yourself to the company.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:23.379
But I wonder this evening, do we have a plan to grow spiritually?

00:35:23.379 --> 00:35:30.839
Do we consider, do we think about, do we spend time with regard to how our spiritual walk

00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:32.519
is?

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:39.519
Do we have that time in God's Word each day, that time in prayer each day that's a priority?

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.519
Because one thing is needful.

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:47.279
And we find this evening that we must not only have a plan to grow, but we must evaluate

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:48.439
our growth.

00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.919
We must refuse to be comfortable or to be content with where we are.

00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:58.739
We must continue to press on to grow in a deeper, more intimate walk with our Lord.

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:01.979
I think of Moses and I think of Paul.

00:36:01.979 --> 00:36:05.979
Both of those men made these statements that they would know God.

00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:11.499
We begin to think about both of those men making the statements in the time that they

00:36:11.499 --> 00:36:13.059
did, Exodus 33.

00:36:13.059 --> 00:36:19.139
You know Moses had spent time with God, I mean on the mount, spent time with God.

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:21.559
He'd been in God's presence.

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:23.039
He was there at the burning bush.

00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:28.339
He was there and saw all of the amazing miracles of the plagues.

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:29.339
He experienced that.

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:33.939
He had this closeness with God so much so that he could say to Pharaoh, okay, when I

00:36:33.939 --> 00:36:37.939
leave I'm going to raise my hand and God's going to, I mean he knew God, but he says

00:36:37.939 --> 00:36:41.899
in Exodus 33 that he wanted to know God.

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:47.579
Paul, in the book of Philippians, he says that I may know Him.

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:51.339
He's in jail ready to face a martyr's death.

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:52.379
He'd walked with God.

00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:56.139
He'd seen God do amazing things.

00:36:56.139 --> 00:37:05.339
He says that I may know Him, that I never get content in my spiritual growth, that I

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:13.899
continue to have that thirsting and that hungering because the reality this evening is that as

00:37:13.899 --> 00:37:21.899
much as you know about God today, He's so far greater than what your mind can even comprehend.

00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:24.299
Listen, I look at my own life.

00:37:24.299 --> 00:37:28.539
I look back 10 years, 20 years in my walk with Christ and listen, if you would have

00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:31.779
asked me 20 years ago, is God great, I would have said yes.

00:37:31.779 --> 00:37:35.379
And I would have had two or three things probably to tell you on why I thought God was great.

00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:39.379
Now you ask me why God's great, I got a whole lot more things to tell you and I say, listen,

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:42.659
as much as I could agree with the psalmist when the psalmist says I know that the Lord

00:37:42.659 --> 00:37:48.579
is great and then I say, but His greatness is unsearchable.

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:55.659
We keep that desire that we walk with God.

00:37:55.659 --> 00:38:03.299
I would say this, number seven to finish, determine to heed God's counsel.

00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:12.019
The first lesson was that God knows our works and I use that first because to every church

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:14.539
He says I know thy works.

00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:18.979
The seventh lesson, again I said this morning there could be 30, 40 lessons that we could

00:38:18.979 --> 00:38:24.539
look at, determine to heed God's counsel, I choose it as the seventh one this evening

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:30.579
because also to every church He finishes by saying, he that hath an ear, let him hear

00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:34.339
what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

00:38:34.339 --> 00:38:38.779
At some point we have to determine that we're going to heed God's counsel.

00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:42.899
We have to acknowledge this evening we need to get our feelings out of the way and not

00:38:42.899 --> 00:38:47.939
be hurt over our toes being stepped on spiritually so to speak.

00:38:47.939 --> 00:38:50.579
Listen conviction's good for us.

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:52.739
It is absolutely good for us.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:56.159
I don't know about you but all week I was convicted about the message I preached this

00:38:56.159 --> 00:39:00.579
morning and then I was convicted again as I preached it this morning.

00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:03.459
Who am I living for?

00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:05.219
Who am I living for?

00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:07.539
Conviction's good for us.

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:12.379
The problem is that we can get under conviction and we can get so resistant to that thing

00:39:12.379 --> 00:39:16.059
and say I'm not going to change, I got my feelings hurt and I got white knuckle syndrome

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:17.059
and so on and so forth.

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:19.579
No, we just take heed to God's counsel.

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:22.019
God loves me and that's why He's correcting me.

00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:23.659
He's saying take heed.

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:29.499
He tells us in Psalm 19 and verse number 11 that it's a benefit for us that as we take

00:39:29.499 --> 00:39:35.139
heed to His words in them that thy servant is warned.

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:41.619
He tells us we're warned and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:46.459
Paul in Colossians 1, he's saying that night and day he's warning everyone.

00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:47.459
Why?

00:39:47.459 --> 00:39:48.459
Why is he warning?

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:50.019
Why is the message going forth?

00:39:50.019 --> 00:39:53.779
Because he wants to present them perfect or complete knowing that they'll stand before

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:58.499
Christ one day.

00:39:58.499 --> 00:39:59.619
I was singing this morning.

00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:06.579
morning, sitting up here on the platform, I was singing that little chorus that some

00:40:06.579 --> 00:40:13.459
of you might know. I'll say, yes, Lord, yes. As I was singing through that little chorus,

00:40:13.459 --> 00:40:19.199
as I was spending time in prayer this morning, I thought about what a precious truth it is

00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:27.659
when God's Spirit speaks to us. We ought to expect it. We ought to long for it. God,

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:33.459
what do you have for me? What do you teach in me? What do I need to change in my life?

00:40:33.459 --> 00:40:38.579
What needs to be altered? Where can I grow? What do I—and God speaks to me. When your

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:44.539
Spirit speaks to me, with my whole heart, I'll agree. It's what the song says. And

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:54.059
my answer will be, yes, Lord, yes. You know, God gives us counsel in His Word about every

00:40:54.059 --> 00:41:02.459
area of life. James 1.22, we're to be doers of the Word, not hearers only. You have relational

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:10.219
problems. God's Word gives us counsel for how to deal with that. But will we heed God's

00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:14.019
counsel? Well, you don't know what they did to us. No, no, no. Will we heed God's counsel?

00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:20.659
Will we follow God's plan? Will we follow what God said? I'm just not going to do that.

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:28.979
What did God say? See, sometimes we can dig our heels in, and we can be so concerned about

00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:35.979
how we think or what we have experienced, and we don't take heed to God's Word. And

00:41:35.979 --> 00:41:43.539
yet God so faithfully and graciously gives us counsel. He gives us counsel. He's given

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:57.279
to us His Word, and He says, listen, obey. Have you ever read Jeremiah, Isaiah, many

00:41:57.279 --> 00:42:03.279
of the other prophets as well? But I think about those two prophets, and again many others,

00:42:03.279 --> 00:42:10.459
how God says, I sent my prophets to you, but you would not hear them. You would not hear

00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:15.539
them. Did it mean that they didn't hear the words audibly? No, that's not necessarily

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:22.059
what it means, because they no doubt heard the words audibly. You remember Ahab's relationship

00:42:22.059 --> 00:42:28.399
with Micaiah? I don't like that guy. He always prophesies negative about me. They're going

00:42:28.399 --> 00:42:32.459
to go into battle, and Joshua says, isn't there an actual prophet of God here? You bring

00:42:32.459 --> 00:42:36.099
all these prophets of Baal, but isn't there a prophet of God? Yeah, but I don't like that

00:42:36.099 --> 00:42:41.019
guy because he always prophesies negative. He heard what he said, but he didn't heed

00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:47.459
what he said. There's a difference in hearing and heeding. And He says to every church,

00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:52.279
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. Why are we

00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:57.739
hearing it? So that we could apply it, so that we could do it. We could spend the entire,

00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:03.139
we could spend the next hour talking about all of the areas of life that God gives us

00:43:03.259 --> 00:43:08.979
counsel for the arena in which you're dealing with and what your troubles are and your situations

00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:16.899
and God gives counsel. But the question is, will we heed it? Will we heed it? These churches,

00:43:16.899 --> 00:43:26.219
God loved them. He loves the church. And He loves us so much that He gives us truth, and

00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:30.739
He wants us to apply truth so that we could be pleasing in His sight. So that we could

00:43:30.739 --> 00:43:37.779
accomplish what He intends for us to accomplish. Seven lessons from seven churches. Let's pray.

00:43:37.779 --> 00:43:42.099
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word and for the

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:51.579
truth contained therein. We thank You, God, for the value that You've placed upon the

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:59.539
local church. We're thankful for the instruction that You've given. Lord, I pray tonight that

00:43:59.539 --> 00:44:03.899
You would just help us to be doers of the Word. Help us to take these lessons and apply

00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:12.299
them in our lives. God, if there's any conviction, I pray that we'd respond in obedience, that

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:19.419
we would not be resistant to the moving of Your Spirit, that we would not quench or grieve

00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:26.019
the Holy Spirit of God. We thank You that You've given us free will. God, I pray that

00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:29.179
You'd help us to make the right choice and the right decision that we'd surrender and

00:44:29.179 --> 00:44:35.419
submit. God, You'd do a work that only You could do. I pray that You'd have Your will

00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:39.459
and way in these moments of imitation. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:43.259
with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Lennon's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:44:43.259 --> 00:44:45.339
And as she does, the altar is open.
