WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
First Corinthians chapter number 11, as you can see, we'll be observing the Lord's Supper

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.739
this evening.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:10.920
And also at the conclusion of the service, we will have our quarterly business meeting.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.939
And so we have several things on the agenda for this evening.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:21.079
First Corinthians chapter number 11, the Bible God, of course, he's provided us with instruction.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.639
And as we think about the local church and we think about the instruction that's been

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:29.879
provided throughout the New Testament with regard to the local church polity and practice

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:37.439
and so on and so forth, we find that he has left us with two ordinances, baptism and the

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:38.439
Lord's Supper.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:43.439
As we think about the, of course, ordinance that's before us this evening, we find in

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.639
the passage of scripture here in First Corinthians chapter 11, begin reading with me in verse

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:48.639
23.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.319
We'll just read a couple of verses and get into the message this evening.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:56.919
The Bible says, for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that

00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:01.479
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.879
And when he had given thanks, he break it and said, take, eat.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:09.319
This is my body, which is broken for you.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.959
This do in remembrance of me.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.879
In verse 25, after the same matter also, he took the cup when he had supped, saying, this

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.919
cup is the New Testament in my blood.

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:24.519
This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.120
And so we see that in verse number 24, again in verse number 25, that phrase, in remembrance

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
of me.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.440
You see it on the front of our Lord's Supper table each week when you come into church

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.160
and you enter in through those back doors and you look towards the front, you see the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.279
Lord's Supper table and you see that statement.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.800
And we find that as we would think about the Lord's Supper, as we would observe the Lord's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.160
Supper this evening, I'd like for us to consider really four things that the Lord's Supper

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.279
should cause us to remember.

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.000
To be mindful of.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We think about the idea of remembrance and we think about the subject with regard to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.760
the text that we're dealing with this evening, the Lord's Supper, I do not believe that a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.600
child of God would necessarily forget these things that we're speaking of.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.639
But the reality is that there are times in which we're not as mindful of these truths

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.240
as we should be.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.759
They're not at the forefront of our mind.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.800
It's not something that we regularly think about.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.600
It is something that we know.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.960
It's not like this is new.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.240
It's not like it's something that we've never heard before.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.520
But we understand that he says this due in remembrance of me.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.600
It's a somber time.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.039
It's an important time as a local church as we would gather and observe the Lord's Supper.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:42.240
As we would think about these thoughts tonight of that which we would remember as a result

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.000
of the Lord's Supper, if you're taking notes, number one, I believe that we should remember

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the agony of Calvary.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.500
Remember the agony of Calvary.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.580
When you think about Calvary, you read through the gospel accounts and you read of just the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.619
brutal nature of that which our Lord and Savior, God in flesh, what he endured.

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.500
We think about the sacrifice that was made on the cross of Calvary.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.740
And as we think about that sacrifice, we're mindful this evening, we must remember this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.860
evening that it was because of my sin.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.699
It was because of your sin.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699
We find that the prophet Isaiah says in Isaiah 53 and verse number six, the latter part

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.860
of that verse, the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.779
We find that in second Corinthians five in verse number 21, the Bible says, for he hath

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:34.059
made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.059
God in him.

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.979
We find that as we look at these first few verses of our text this evening, that it's

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:44.059
there in verse number 24 where the Bible says, take eat, this is my body.

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.220
Notice what he says, which is broken for you.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.699
We understand that as we read the gospel accounts, in fact, as you read prophecy, that

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.860
there would not be a bone of our Savior broken.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.380
And we find that that prophecy was fulfilled.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.100
In fact, as they would come to break the legs of the male factors of those that were crucified

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.580
with Christ, they came to the Lord and they saw that he was dead already.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.580
Why?

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.179
Because no man taketh my life.

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.259
I lay it down is what he said.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.100
I am the good shepherd in John chapter number 10.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.179
And when he had completed the payment for sin, we find that he says this, it is finished,

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.940
and he gave up the ghost.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.260
When they came to him, and because of all that was going on and because of the urgency

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.459
with regard to the high day and so on and so forth, they were to break the legs of these

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.619
other men.

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:39.100
But because he was already dead, he did not have his legs broken.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.459
That was a fulfillment of prophecy.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:46.859
And when the Bible says here in 1 Corinthians 11 and verse number 24, which is broken for

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:50.299
you, it's not talking about his bones being broken, but you think about the way in which

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:56.299
he was scourged and he was beaten and you think about his flesh being torn and all of

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:58.100
the agony of calvary.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.820
And we begin to understand, and if you were to take some time and read through the account

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.380
in each of the gospel records of the crucifixion, you find that there's great agony.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.739
But he did it because he loved us.

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:17.980
He did it because he knew that there'd be no other way for man to be redeemed.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.579
It's only through that death on the cross of calvary, the subsequent burial and glorious

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:28.339
resurrection that mankind could be redeemed.

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.779
And so as we look in verse 24, we see that he mentions about his body that was broken.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.720
He says in verse number 25, this cup is the New Testament in my blood.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.320
This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.519
Not only was his body broken for you, but we find that his blood was shed for us.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:49.920
We think about the sinless, precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.600
We find that Peter speaks about the fact that we're redeemed not with corruptible things,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.040
but we're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.200
We think about that blood and you begin to understand as you would find that Paul would

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.320
say to the church in Corinth, Christ, our Passover, and you'd go back to the Old Testament

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.799
and begin to see about the blood and just the many references in the Old Testament to

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:18.040
the blood that had to be shed, the blood that had to be applied, and you find that as you

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.720
come to calvary, you come to the New Testament, you find all of those prophecies are fulfilled

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.200
in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.679
We begin to think about this do in remembrance of me.

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:32.359
What is it that we're to remember?

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:35.600
First of all, we're to remember the agony of calvary.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.559
We understand that he was mocked, he was beaten, he was whipped, he was just ridiculed.

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:46.000
We find that during the time of mocking, if thou be the Christ, come down.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.559
Aren't you thankful he didn't come down off the cross?

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:51.399
He finished the work.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.119
He did what he was supposed to do and he shed his precious blood.

00:06:55.119 --> 00:07:02.000
I'm mindful of the fact that the Romans had sought to really take and cause crucifixion

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.720
to be the most painful death possible.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.119
In a weird, twisted kind of way, they tried to master that art, if you will, of crucifixion

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:17.160
so that they could inflict as much pain on the individual that would be crucified for

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.959
the longest period of time.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:20.959
That's what they did.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:25.839
You study history and you look at what happened and to think that the God of the universe,

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:32.239
God in flesh, that he was willing to suffer to endure that for me and for you.

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:35.440
That's what we remember when we think about these elements that are set before us this

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.760
evening and we observe the Lord's Supper.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.359
We're mindful of the agony of calvary, the fact that it was for me.

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:47.440
Listen, it was Barabbas that was released, right?

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.399
And he said of Christ, crucify him.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:55.760
That cross was for Barabbas, but in a very special, important way, we can understand

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.559
that that was my cross, that was your cross.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.519
We were condemned to die, but he took our place.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.760
Aren't you so thankful for that?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.359
And again, it's not as if we forget the agony of calvary, it's just at times in our lives

00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:14.200
we're not as mindful of it as we should be.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.559
The reality is that there are many world religions today and there are many that, of course,

00:08:19.559 --> 00:08:24.119
the enemy has blinded the minds of them that believe not, and lest the light of the glorious

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:29.399
gospel should shine in unto them, and they've been told lies and they've been deceived with

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:33.799
regard to salvation and eternity and what have you.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:38.760
But the reality is on a number of occasions I've asked individuals, well, as your leader

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.919
of whatever your particular religion is, did they die for you?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.919
What's the answer?

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.919
No.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.919
No.

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:50.840
But our Savior, he died for us.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.159
It's precious.

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:53.799
It's something that we ought to be mindful of.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:58.880
Number two, we remember the glory of his resurrection, not only the agony of calvary, but we remember

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.520
the glory of his resurrection.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.159
In 2 Timothy chapter number two, we find that Paul, as he's writing this last letter to

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:09.520
his son in the faith, Timothy, he's giving him great instruction, but he says in the

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:16.679
second chapter with regard to the resurrection of our Savior, he says this in 2 Timothy 2

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.840
in verse 8,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:25.320
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.640
my gospel.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.039
We do not necessarily see in 1 Corinthians chapter number 11 a verse that would point

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:35.440
to the resurrection, but we find that there's a verse that points to a second coming, and

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.080
he can't come again if he didn't rise, amen?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.799
And so the resurrection is implied.

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:42.880
It's understood that he did not stay in that tomb.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
And what a blessing.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.320
We often think about the resurrection during the celebration in the spring of Easter time

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.400
and what have you, but the reality is that we meet on Sunday each and every week.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
Why?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.039
Because of the resurrection, because we serve a risen Savior.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.039
Paul said that if Christ be not risen,

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.239
then our faith is vain, our preaching is vain.

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:07.599
But Christ is risen from the dead in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:10.359
And what a joy, what a blessing to know

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.319
that that stone was rolled away.

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:15.999
We sang this morning, because he lives.

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:18.199
Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.679
We don't know what's on the morrow,

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:21.959
but we know who holds tomorrow.

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.399
We know that he lives.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.739
I believe it was that third verse says

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:29.399
that because he lives, all fear is gone.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.839
And you think about the way in which we understand

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.519
that we serve a risen Savior

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.959
and how he deals with our fears and our difficulties.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.879
Why? Because we can rest in him.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.479
And we're mindful this evening.

00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:44.519
Listen, when we observe the Lord's Supper,

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.119
we're not only mindful,

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:48.439
we're not only to remember the agony of Calvary,

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.339
but we ought to remember the glory of the resurrection.

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:53.879
I mean, when we live our lives on a daily basis,

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:57.959
we live knowing that I serve a risen Savior.

00:10:57.959 --> 00:10:59.199
He lives, amen?

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:02.639
It's the cornerstone of our faith.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:05.039
It is the distinction that sets us apart

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.179
from any other world religion

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:09.719
of all of the face of the earth.

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:13.159
You can go even at this hour

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:15.399
to that tomb in which Jesus was buried

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:19.479
and you will not find any remains of Jesus there.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.719
Why? Because he rose.

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:23.019
He rose.

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:27.999
We find that there are men, leaders,

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:31.239
they have shrined and have these places

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:33.119
of their burial places,

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:37.359
great religious places to visit and go to.

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:39.559
But when we go, if we were to travel

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:42.699
and be to the place in which our Savior was buried,

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:46.559
we go there because he conquered death.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:48.479
He rose in victory.

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.599
You remember what he said to his disciples

00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:53.359
in John chapter number two.

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:56.039
In fact, there was some debate that was going on

00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:59.119
and he, of course, as we would understand,

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:02.639
this is the first time in which he cleansed the temple.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.139
He poured out the changer's money

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.599
according to verse number 15.

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:08.919
And he said, take these things hence in verse number 16,

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:11.919
make not my father's house and house of merchandise.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:14.679
And it says this in verse number 19.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.919
In verse 18, the Jews said unto him,

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.759
what signs showeth unto us,

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:21.399
seeing that thou doest these things?

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:23.839
And Jesus said to them, destroy this temple

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:27.399
and in three days I will raise it up.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:31.119
This is the very beginning of his earthly ministry.

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:34.799
He's announcing, he's informing his disciples

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.879
that he's going to be crucified,

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.279
but he's going to rise again.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:43.539
The Jews, they said 40 and six years

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:45.279
was this temple in building

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:48.519
and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:51.679
But he spake of the temple of his body.

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.759
And in verse number 22, it says this,

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:57.319
when therefore he was risen from the dead,

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:02.319
his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:05.299
and they believed the Scripture in the word

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.999
which Jesus had said.

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.999
What was the message of the angels?

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:13.039
Come, see the place where the Lord laid.

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:14.559
But he's not here.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:15.399
Why?

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:18.239
Because he has risen as he said.

00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:20.099
First Corinthians 11, not only to remember

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:23.899
the agony of Calvary, the glory of the resurrection,

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.099
but I believe that we ought to remember number three,

00:13:26.099 --> 00:13:28.659
the promise of his return.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:30.739
Remember the promise of his return.

00:13:30.739 --> 00:13:32.699
The Bible tells us in verse number 26

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:35.139
as we continue reading through First Corinthians 11,

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:37.019
it says for as often as you eat this bread

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.459
and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:43.299
in these last three words, our precious words,

00:13:43.299 --> 00:13:46.419
till he come.

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.459
I don't know when he is coming, but I know he's coming.

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:52.739
I don't know the hour, no man knoweth the hour,

00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:53.979
but we know that he's coming.

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:58.119
The promise of his return is as sure as it has ever been.

00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:00.739
In fact, I believe that as we would consider

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.899
the day and age in which we're living,

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:05.639
that we are closer now than we've ever been.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:07.879
We can see it on the horizon.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:10.579
The songwriters that have made the songs

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:13.179
of listen for the trumpet, Jesus is coming.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.339
Man, I am looking for the blessed hope

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.419
and glorious return of our great God and Savior,

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:21.459
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:24.219
We find the Bible tells us that he will not tarry

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:27.379
in Hebrews 10 in verse number 37.

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.339
We find there are some that would say,

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:33.339
if the Lord tarries, he's coming, but he will not tarry.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.619
The Bible says in Hebrews 10 in verse number 37,

00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:39.139
for yet a little while, and he that shall come

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:43.299
will come and will not tarry.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.119
He's coming right on time.

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:46.859
Now, I'll be honest with you,

00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:50.179
there are days in which I wish it was on my timing.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:51.019
Amen?

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:52.859
It'd be all right if he came tonight.

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:54.539
Will you be all right with that?

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.219
Yeah, man, we'd be okay with that, right?

00:14:56.219 --> 00:14:58.539
It'd be okay if he came back tonight.

00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:00.979
He's not coming in my timing or in your timing,

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:03.659
he's coming according to his timing.

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:05.919
And his timing's perfect.

00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:07.299
And he's not going to delay.

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:09.899
It's not gonna be a minute earlier or a minute later

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:11.379
than it's supposed to be.

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.599
It'd be right on time.

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:18.559
We find that he says this in James 5 in verse number eight,

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:21.519
as we consider, again, another promise

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.879
with regard to his return.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:25.919
It says, be also patient, establish your hearts

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:29.919
for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:31.879
Coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:32.959
We're going home.

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.999
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:41.879
Hebrews 11 talks about being strangers and pilgrims.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:44.679
And we find that this world,

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:46.959
this world is gonna pass away,

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:50.799
no less thereof, according to 1 John chapter two.

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:55.419
But man, we're looking for our home, our heavenly home,

00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:58.679
where we will be with our Savior for all of eternity.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:01.279
And what a joy to know in 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:03.939
a passage of Scripture that's familiar to us,

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:07.119
we find that it's here in this portion of Scripture

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:09.819
that we find great comfort.

00:16:09.819 --> 00:16:12.539
In fact, he concludes the passage of Scripture

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:15.779
with saying, wherefore comfort one another with these words,

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:18.579
but it's here in 1 Thessalonians 4 in verse 16,

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:21.759
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.459
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:25.579
with the trump of God,

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:27.379
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:30.439
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:33.699
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air

00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:38.699
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:42.099
Well, that's going to be glory, isn't it?

00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:45.979
When our faith is made sight.

00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:47.219
Amen?

00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:50.899
When we see Him face to face.

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:52.539
This is wonderful.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:54.819
Glorious.

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:57.259
We find that Paul,

00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:59.779
as he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:03.379
in the first chapter, he says for me to live is Christ,

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.299
but to die is gain.

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:09.019
He goes on a couple of verses later in verse 23

00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:11.539
and says that he was in a strait betwixt two,

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:13.979
having a desire to depart to be with Christ,

00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:18.979
and he describes it this way, which is far better.

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:20.979
Just far better.

00:17:20.979 --> 00:17:24.499
And to understand that here in 1 Corinthians 11,

00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:26.739
as we look at the passage of Scripture

00:17:26.739 --> 00:17:28.819
dealing with this ordinance that's been given to us

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:30.739
as a local church of the Lord's Supper,

00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:33.599
he says that as often as you eat this bread

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:36.639
and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:39.359
till He come.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.319
He's coming again.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.799
And we observe this so that we'd be mindful of,

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:46.679
that we would live daily with the understanding,

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:49.479
with the knowledge and being mindful of the fact

00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:51.079
that today could be the day.

00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:55.399
It'd be wonderful if today was the day.

00:17:56.599 --> 00:18:01.079
The reality is that the truth of the return of Christ

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:03.879
should impact every child of God.

00:18:03.879 --> 00:18:05.319
It is absolutely possible,

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:07.039
according to what we read in 1 John 2,

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:10.079
that we could be ashamed at Him at His appearing.

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.959
That's what the Bible says.

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:13.679
And I hope that not one of us

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:15.639
would be ashamed of Him at His appearing,

00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:18.479
but we find that it's possible that that could be the case,

00:18:18.479 --> 00:18:21.119
and we find that as he enters into the third chapter

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:21.959
of 1 John, he says,

00:18:21.959 --> 00:18:25.659
"'Beloved, now are we the sons of God,

00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:28.579
"'and it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:31.399
"'but we know that when He shall appear,

00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:34.179
"'when He shall appear, not if He shall appear,

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:37.479
"'but when He shall appear, we shall be like Him,

00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:39.239
"'for we shall see Him as He is,

00:18:39.239 --> 00:18:42.000
"'and every man that hath this hope in Him

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
"'purifieth himself even as he is pure.'"

00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:49.899
What if it was today?

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:51.500
Are you ready?

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.539
Are you ready for the coming of the Lord?

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:57.619
Not only do we think about the Lord's Supper

00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:01.619
as a reminder, this due in remembrance of me,

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.699
that we'd remember the agony of Calvary,

00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:05.299
the glory of the resurrection,

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:07.259
the promise of His return,

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:08.859
but I would say this,

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:11.179
as we look at the remaining section here

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:12.979
of 1 Corinthians 11 of our text,

00:19:12.979 --> 00:19:16.419
that we'd remember that one day we will stand before Him.

00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:20.899
It says this in verse 27 of 1 Corinthians 11,

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:26.479
"'Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:28.679
"'and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:31.639
"'shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:33.119
"'But let a man examine himself,

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:36.119
"'and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:38.199
"'For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily

00:19:38.199 --> 00:19:40.359
"'eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.919
"'not discerning the Lord's body.

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.139
"'For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you,

00:19:45.139 --> 00:19:47.119
"'and many sleep, they've died.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.559
"'For if we would judge ourselves,

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:52.239
"'we should not be judged.'"

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:54.039
As I look at these verses of Scripture

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:57.119
and we're mindful of the individual

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:00.239
that would be the proper one.

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:02.639
to receive the elements of the Lord's Supper.

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.939
We understand this evening that there's absolutely

00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:07.139
no saving grace in these elements

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.939
that we'll distribute in just a little while.

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:11.839
They don't change into anything but what they are.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:14.439
It's a piece of unleavened bread

00:20:14.439 --> 00:20:17.539
to represent the perfect, sinless body

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:19.339
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:22.339
It's pure grape juice that is to represent

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:25.139
the sinless, perfect blood of our Savior.

00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:27.639
And that's all it's ever going to be.

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:28.839
It's just a picture.

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:32.239
But the one that would take,

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:34.739
that would partake of these elements,

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:38.539
that individual is to be a saved person.

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:41.239
These elements are not for the lost person.

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:44.739
This ordinance that's been given to the local church,

00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:46.139
as you think of both of them,

00:20:46.139 --> 00:20:48.239
the baptism and the Lord's Supper,

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:50.339
the candidate must be a saved person.

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:51.739
We believe in baptism.

00:20:51.739 --> 00:20:53.839
We understand the Bible to teach

00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:56.839
that it is those that are saved, right?

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:59.339
It believers baptism by immersion.

00:20:59.339 --> 00:21:01.739
That's why we don't baptize infants.

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:03.539
We don't believe in infant baptism.

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:05.939
Why? Because the Bible teaches

00:21:05.939 --> 00:21:10.039
that believers baptism by immersion.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.339
We had a baby dedication a few weeks ago,

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:14.339
but that baby dedication, as I mentioned,

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:17.239
as I preached and as I spoke with those families,

00:21:17.239 --> 00:21:19.539
that it's more of a charge to the parents

00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:21.239
than it is about the children.

00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:25.039
Those children, unless they look at pictures

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:27.939
from years down the road from now

00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:29.439
and look at the little Bible

00:21:29.439 --> 00:21:30.439
that was given them as a certificate,

00:21:30.439 --> 00:21:32.839
they don't even know what happened on that day.

00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:35.739
The charge is to the parents.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:39.539
And so we find that for the Lord's Supper,

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:42.239
the person to partake is a saved person.

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:43.439
It's not only a saved person,

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:47.439
but it's somebody that's walking properly with God.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.239
This idea of let a man examine himself,

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:53.139
I believe that the examination and judging of ourselves

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:55.339
that is mentioned in these verses of Scripture

00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:59.639
is intended to lead us to righteous living.

00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:02.139
The purpose of this examination

00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:04.339
is so that we would live in a righteous manner.

00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:06.439
The purpose of the examination

00:22:06.439 --> 00:22:08.239
is not for us to sit back and say,

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:09.539
okay, well, I'm not worthy,

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.639
so therefore I'm not going to partake.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:13.639
That's not really the idea.

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:17.339
The idea is that if we find as we examine ourselves

00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:20.639
that there's something between me and my Savior,

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:23.539
if there's some kind of unconfessed sin in my life

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:25.639
that I get that thing right

00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:28.939
so that I can partake of the Lord's Supper.

00:22:28.939 --> 00:22:32.239
Why, because we have a God who is ready to pardon.

00:22:32.239 --> 00:22:33.739
We have a God who's ready to forgive.

00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:36.739
We have a God who is gracious and merciful.

00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:38.739
He's promised that if we confess our sins,

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:40.639
that he is faithful and just to forgive us

00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:42.839
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:44.839
And what a blessing to understand

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:47.639
that as we go through this process of examination

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:51.339
that we say it's to lead me to righteous living.

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:54.139
It's really the idea we find in Ephesians 5

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:57.039
proving what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord,

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.739
that I would examine myself.

00:23:00.739 --> 00:23:02.439
Why is it that we examine ourselves?

00:23:02.439 --> 00:23:04.539
Well, because we're being mindful of the fact

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:06.639
that one day I'm going to stand before him.

00:23:07.639 --> 00:23:09.239
The Bible details for us

00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:11.739
and gives description of two judgments

00:23:11.739 --> 00:23:14.639
that will take place that we'll focus on this evening

00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:17.639
with regard to this subject matter.

00:23:17.639 --> 00:23:20.739
In one of those judgments, as a child of God,

00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:23.439
we have no concern of standing at that judgment.

00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:26.039
And that is the Great White Throne Judgment.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:29.939
I am so thankful that if you've been born again

00:23:29.939 --> 00:23:33.239
because I've trusted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior,

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:36.439
I will not stand at the Great White Throne Judgment.

00:23:36.439 --> 00:23:39.939
The second death has no power over us.

00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:40.939
Amen?

00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:44.439
That's a wonderful truth of God's Word

00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:47.739
but God's Word tells us about the Bema Seat of Christ,

00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:49.139
the Judgment Seat of Christ.

00:23:49.139 --> 00:23:52.339
In 2 Corinthians 5, I'll probably never forget this.

00:23:52.339 --> 00:23:55.139
I remember sitting in prophecy class

00:23:55.139 --> 00:23:57.539
as a Bible college student

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:00.339
and we had a brother, Maddox,

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.139
and Ms. Debra, you'll appreciate this,

00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:04.539
we had a student from Boston

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:08.039
and she had that crazy Boston accent,

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:10.639
you know, you pack the car and the gauge or whatever.

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:12.239
I mean, it's just crazy, right?

00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:14.439
And so the professor, he says,

00:24:14.439 --> 00:24:16.039
so what's the Bema?

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:16.940
Man, she raised her hand

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.139
and she wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer,

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:20.739
if you know what I mean, and that's not an insult.

00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:22.239
She just kind of knew.

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:24.639
She just really was a little behind on some things

00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:27.039
and she just didn't know some things.

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:31.239
But man, she really never participated in answering questions.

00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:32.739
But when the professor said,

00:24:32.739 --> 00:24:34.339
what's the Bema, man, she raised her hand

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:35.539
and that's a BMW.

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:37.339
I mean, that's a Bema, right?

00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:38.339
It's a car.

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:41.139
And the professor just started dying laughing

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:43.539
and thought, what in the world?

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:47.739
But the reality is that the Bema seat

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.239
or the judgment seat of Christ,

00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:54.139
if you're a child of God, you're going to stand there.

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:56.639
In 1 Corinthians, we're in 2 Corinthians 5,

00:24:56.639 --> 00:24:58.639
in 1 Corinthians, he talks about our works,

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:00.839
whether they're wood, hay, or stubble,

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:02.639
they'll be burned up,

00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:05.940
gold, silver, or precious stone.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.639
Notice here in 2 Corinthians 5 in verse number 10,

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:15.139
the Bible says, for we must all appear

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:17.440
before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.639
Do you know that none of us are getting out of it?

00:25:22.639 --> 00:25:23.940
It's just not possible.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.940
We all must appear.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.239
I'm thankful that I'm not going to be judged for sin.

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:32.539
It's already been taken care of at Calvary.

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:33.940
I've already been saved.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.339
I've been saved.

00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:39.039
His righteousness is imputed upon me, right?

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.139
Imputed righteousness.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:43.239
We mentioned that from 2 Corinthians 5 in verse 21.

00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:45.139
What a joy.

00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:47.440
But I am going to stand, and it says here

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.440
that everyone may receive the things done in his body.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.739
According to that, he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:56.440
The things that God has given us,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.339
the opportunities that he has given us,

00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:01.539
the gifts that he has given us,

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:03.539
the talents that he has blessed us with,

00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:05.539
we're going to give an account.

00:26:05.539 --> 00:26:06.239
What did you do?

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:07.839
How did you use what I gave you?

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:11.440
What did you do with the opportunities that I gave you?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.139
And I believe that, listen,

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:17.239
the reality of standing before Christ one day,

00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:20.539
that ought to shake us to our very core.

00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:21.440
Honestly.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.739
I understand that he loves us,

00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:26.239
and I understand it's not to be judged.

00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:28.539
I understand there are crowns to be received.

00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:31.339
There are five crowns that the New Testament speaks of.

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:32.440
And with those crowns,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.539
we'll be able to cast them back at the feet of God,

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:37.339
according to Revelation.

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:40.339
And what a joy that is and what a blessing.

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:44.039
But when you stand before God Almighty

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:45.940
at the judgment seat of Christ,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.639
the Bible tells us

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:52.139
that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:26:52.139 --> 00:26:54.239
When I understand 1 Corinthians 11,

00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:56.739
when I consider the Lord's Supper

00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:00.940
and the thoughts tonight of what we should remember,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.440
what we should be mindful of,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.139
I believe that as I look at these verses of Scripture

00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:07.839
in verses 27 through 31

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:11.940
and consider the examination and the judging of ourselves,

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.539
that it is intended to lead us to righteous living

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:16.839
and it is preparatory for that time

00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:19.639
in which we'll stand before the Lord.

00:27:19.639 --> 00:27:20.639
If you're to be examined,

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.739
I know I've used this illustration over the years,

00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:25.139
but it's a very pertinent illustration.

00:27:25.139 --> 00:27:27.639
I think one in which we can each understand

00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:30.839
and be able to deal with.

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:32.839
If you're to be examined by someone,

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:35.639
if there's something going on in your workplace

00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:37.039
and there's going to be an audit,

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:40.339
or if you were in the military as my dad was,

00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:44.039
I remember many times as a young child

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.539
standing, sitting in the kitchen.

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:49.339
I can remember in my mind even right now,

00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:51.940
I can see the place in North Carolina where we lived

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.839
and sitting at the table in our kitchen

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:57.839
and watching my dad tedious measurements

00:27:57.839 --> 00:27:59.639
being taken for the uniform

00:27:59.639 --> 00:28:01.440
and all that was going to take place.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.739
And I'd say, what are you doing?

00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:04.239
Why? Why so much time?

00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:05.639
What's going on?

00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:07.940
There's an inspection tomorrow.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.239
There's an inspection tomorrow.

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:11.039
And what was he doing?

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.039
Well, he was going through with that fine-tooth comb,

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:14.739
so to speak,

00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:17.239
and he was measuring and re-measuring

00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:19.239
and making sure the little ribbons

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:21.539
were all exactly like they're supposed to be

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:24.239
on the breast of the jacket

00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:27.139
and making sure that the little stars within the ribbons

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:29.440
and, I mean, just everything precise,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.039
exactly where it's supposed to be.

00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.539
Why?

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:33.440
Because that next morning,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:39.539
somebody else of a higher rank was going to inspect.

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:41.039
And so he wanted to be ready.

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:42.339
He wanted to be prepared.

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:44.839
He wanted to go through that process.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:45.640
Why?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.239
So that he was ready for the inspection.

00:28:49.239 --> 00:28:51.539
We understand audits and the business world

00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:53.339
and different things and you prepare for them.

00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:53.839
Why?

00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:55.640
If you've done the things that you're supposed to do,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.739
you prepared properly,

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:58.739
you don't have to fear what they're going to do

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:01.440
when they come in.

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:05.140
And as I think about this truth of self-examination,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.739
judging ourselves,

00:29:06.739 --> 00:29:09.140
that it is preparatory for that time

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.539
in which we'll stand before the Lord.

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:13.039
We must all appear.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.739
We're going to give an account.

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:17.839
Tonight, as we observe the Lord's Supper,

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:20.039
this do in remembrance of me.

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:21.339
Four thoughts.

00:29:21.339 --> 00:29:24.239
Nothing that is new,

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:25.440
but at times in our lives,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.739
we might just not be as mindful of these things.

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:34.339
We ought to remember the agony of Calvary.

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:38.839
The great price that was paid for your sin and for my sin.

00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:41.239
We ought to remember that he rose,

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:43.440
the glory of the resurrection.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.940
Wonderful to know that he conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.039
We serve a risen Savior.

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.140
Amen?

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.839
We ought to remember the promise of his return.

00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:56.339
It could be today.

00:29:56.339 --> 00:29:57.539
It could be tomorrow.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:59.039
Are we ready?

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.440
Are we living our...

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.440
lives with that anticipation that today could be the day that our Savior comes

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.600
back, because that promise is as sure as it's ever been. And finally, we ought to

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.360
remember that one day we're gonna stand before Him. And as we understand that

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:23.320
truth, He's given us these other truths to help us prepare for that day. Oh, that

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:30.640
God would help us as we observe the Lord's Supper to have a sober attitude

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.960
as we consider these truths and be thankful that in His wisdom He's given

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.480
the church this ordinance. And it's beneficial for us. Let's pray. Father, we

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.160
love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the privilege of being

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.480
able to gather tonight and to open your Word. We thank you for the privilege of

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:02.360
being able to observe the Lord's Supper. And Lord, I pray that you would allow us

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:09.880
to be mindful of these thoughts tonight, these truths, these realities. God, we

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.480
pray that you'd bless the remainder of our service, not only the observing of

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.840
the Lord's Supper, but also the business meeting that would follow. We thank you

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.440
and praise you for that, what you have done in our lives. We pray that you'd bless

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.840
our time now, for it's in Christ's name we pray. It's today.
