1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
the book of Psalms this evening, Psalm 78.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,519
And I'll be looking here at the first eight verses,

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:09,000
Psalm 78, verses one through eight.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'll read the verses of scripture

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,600
and we'll get into the message this evening,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,439
Psalm 78, verses one through eight.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,479
I've titled the message tonight, The Generation to Come.

8
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,959
And I am thankful that we have an opportunity

9
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,879
to influence a future generation, amen.

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,079
And we had the privilege this evening

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,680
of seeing a future generation stand here

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,360
on our platform, of course, in just a couple of Sundays.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
On October the ninth, we're going to have

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
a teen takeover service in our evening service.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,459
And we'll have the opportunity to see a generation

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,700
between ours and that one, the teenagers.

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,080
And we'll have the privilege of being able

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,919
to see them minister and use the talents

19
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,279
that God has equipped them with.

20
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,000
And that thrills my heart.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
I am so thankful for a generation to come.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,080
Notice what the psalmist says,

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
beginning in verse number one of Psalm 78.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,680
Give ear, O my people, to my law.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,419
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

26
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:08,319
I will open my mouth and a parable

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,120
I will utter dark sayings of old,

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,459
which we have heard and known

29
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,839
and our fathers have told us.

30
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,680
Notice verse number four.

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,839
We will not hide them from their children,

32
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,040
showing to the generation to come

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,599
the praises of the Lord and his strength

34
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,440
and his wonderful works that he hath done.

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,160
For he established a testimony in Jacob

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,319
and appointed a law in Israel,

37
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,279
which he commanded our fathers

38
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:40,000
that they should make them known to their children,

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,160
that the generation to come might know them,

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,440
even the children which should be born,

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,440
who should arise and declare them to their children,

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,879
that they might set their hope in God

43
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,160
and not forget the works of God,

44
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,120
but keep his commandments.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
It might not be as their fathers,

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,120
a stubborn and rebellious generation,

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,800
a generation that set not their heart aright

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,199
and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

49
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,519
In verse number four,

50
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,039
and then again in verse number six,

51
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,119
you see that phrase, the generation to come.

52
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,399
As I mentioned already,

53
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,199
I am thankful for the generation to come.

54
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,880
I am also thankful for those that God has equipped

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,080
and called to work with the future generation.

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,199
This evening, as we begin to think about the children

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,320
that were here and singing, of course,

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,639
we know that we have folks that in our church

59
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,880
have served on Sunday mornings,

60
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,720
those that serve in our nursery

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,559
and our children's church ministry.

62
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:37,839
On Wednesday evening, we have our student ministries

63
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,960
and we have folks that have responded to the work

64
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,039
that God has done in and through their hearts and lives

65
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,119
and they have surrendered themselves

66
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,440
so that they could be used of God.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,399
They've responded to the prompting

68
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,839
of the Holy Spirit of God.

69
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,960
And I believe that they are serving

70
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,919
as of the ability that God has given them.

71
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,919
Indeed, I would say this tonight,

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,559
that it is a blessing to be laborers together with God.

73
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,199
And what a joy to have the privilege

74
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:13,199
of serving God together as a team, as a body of believers.

75
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,639
A couple of Sunday nights ago, I had the,

76
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,759
on Sunday night, we preached the message,

77
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,240
many members, but one body.

78
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,919
And just how God has equipped each member of the body

79
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,479
for his purpose and to fulfill his purpose.

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,080
And we were mindful of several things

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,520
on that Sunday evening.

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,479
And now as we begin to think about the work

83
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,199
in the lives of these young people

84
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,360
with regard to the generation to come,

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,119
I would say this evening that we must acknowledge

86
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,679
that there is a mighty battle that is taking place

87
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,880
for this generation to come.

88
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,440
It has always been the case that there is a battle

89
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,320
that is raging over a future generation.

90
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,039
But as we sit here today on the eve of the month of October

91
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,639
in just a few days and 2022,

92
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,119
it's hard to believe the year is almost over.

93
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:03,279
But we see that this battle for a future generation,

94
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,639
for the generation to come is raging.

95
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,559
And we must acknowledge this evening

96
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,639
that as we begin to consider the word of God

97
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,639
and the responsibility that we have to impact

98
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,779
and influence a future generation,

99
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,820
we must understand that we have the need

100
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,660
to be actively engaged in seeking

101
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,220
to influence a future generation.

102
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,940
Active engagement is essential, it is imperative.

103
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,380
I find this evening as we think about the church family,

104
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,440
and obviously we have parents of children that are here

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,959
that are seeking to influence their children.

106
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,660
We have workers in our church that serve in capacities

107
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,040
of teaching and assisting and what have you

108
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,760
that are seeking to influence a future generation.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,160
But the reality is that each and every one of us

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,279
ought to be engaged in having some level of influence

111
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,160
in a future generation, in the generation to come.

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,299
I want you to consider this evening, as I mentioned,

113
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,559
that active engagement is required.

114
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,799
I want you to understand

115
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,200
that those that are in opposition to God,

116
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,679
those that are in opposition to the word of God,

117
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,799
they are actively engaged

118
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,679
on seeking to reach the next generation.

119
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,959
And not reach the next generation like we talk about.

120
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,899
We talk about reaching the next generation

121
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,640
for the cause of Christ

122
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,760
and to influence them with the word of God,

123
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,380
but we find that there's a group of people

124
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,660
that are on our earth today

125
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,519
that are the workers of iniquity,

126
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,720
that are false teachers,

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,640
that are seeking to capture this future generation.

128
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,720
They're seeking to indoctrinate them.

129
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,579
They're seeking to develop their philosophy

130
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,000
and their worldview.

131
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,600
And we must be aware of this battle that is raging.

132
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,720
I want you to consider this evening,

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,480
by way of introduction, a couple of quotes.

134
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,480
One from the, of course, wicked Nazi dictator Hitler.

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
He said this,

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
"'He alone who owns the youth gains the future.'"

137
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes, people are following in that exact mindset.

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
"'He alone who owns the youth gains the future.'"

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,140
Why do you think there's such a battle over schooling?

140
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,760
The Department of Education.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,839
It is a battle.

142
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,119
And they are seeking at the youngest of age

143
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:37,239
to indoctrinate the future generation.

144
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,000
Because he alone who owns the youth gains the future.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
I know that that's not Bible,

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,779
but there's a lot of truth to what they said,

147
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,339
or what he said.

148
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,359
Let me share this quote with you.

149
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,739
Atheist Lawrence Krauss said this,

150
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,959
"'Change is always one generation away.

151
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
"'So if we can plant the seeds of doubt in our children,

152
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,980
"'religion will go away in a generation,

153
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,839
"'or at least largely go away.'"

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,859
And he followed up that statement with this one.

155
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:22,859
And that's what I think we have an obligation to do.

156
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,679
Wow.

157
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,640
Wow.

158
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,559
And we understand this evening,

159
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,380
the battle that is raging.

160
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,459
Some of us at a higher level than others.

161
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,940
Some are more aware, some have children,

162
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,140
and you see firsthand what's taking place

163
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,260
and how the system that we're in,

164
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,980
the culture that we're in is seeking to influence them

165
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,040
and seeking to steal their hearts

166
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,380
and to give them a different worldview.

167
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,739
And we look at that quote that it said there

168
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,179
from that atheist Krauss.

169
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,679
He said that if we can plant the seeds of doubt,

170
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,299
just plant some seeds of doubt.

171
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
By the way, isn't that what Satan did

172
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,959
in Genesis chapter number three?

173
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,959
"'Yea, hath God said, ye shall not surely die.'"

174
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,019
Listen, doubt is the enemy of faith.

175
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,959
Doubt hinders.

176
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,619
And we find that the influence of this society

177
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,940
upon a future generation is given to us,

178
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,920
and they've put these things in writing,

179
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,899
and we cannot put our head in the sand

180
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,460
and act as if they just love our children

181
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,020
and they just wanna teach them.

182
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,099
Education is no longer just about English

183
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,539
and arithmetic and reading.

184
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,820
It's no longer just about those things.

185
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,900
And we find that there's such a battle that is raging.

186
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,159
They are seeking not only to reach the elementary age group,

187
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,500
but now they're seeking even to reach into the preschools.

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,140
And they have desires, even in the state of Virginia,

189
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,159
they have desires to give some curriculum

190
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,719
that would have this universal type of curriculum.

191
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Why?

192
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,760
So that they can control it,

193
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,119
so that they know exactly what is being taught

194
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:14,880
and how they are going to indoctrinate a future generation.

195
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,619
And so what do we do about that?

196
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,440
When we think about a generation to come,

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,520
some have had this perspective,

198
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,840
I see the need, I see that there's a departure,

199
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,440
but I just don't know what to do.

200
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,900
I don't know what I can do.

201
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,380
And I believe as we begin to look at this passage

202
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,559
of scripture here in Psalm 78,

203
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,059
that we look at just a couple of thoughts this evening

204
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,219
from this passage and I hope that it would give us

205
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:41,859
a great burden for a generation to come,

206
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:43,780
that it would burden our hearts,

207
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,700
that God would help us to have a level of engagement

208
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,900
to be able to have an influence on this generation to come.

209
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,659
I want you to notice in Psalm 78, verse number four,

210
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,239
notice the first statement here.

211
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,919
The Bible says, we will not hide them.

212
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,259
from their children.

213
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,759
And then you find in verse number five,

214
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,019
at the end of the verse,

215
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,179
it says that they should make them known

216
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,759
to their children.

217
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,819
Again, this requires active engagement.

218
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,059
When you think about this idea

219
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,279
of not hiding them from their children,

220
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
it's not the idea that they're going

221
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,899
and trying to conceal truth or hide truth,

222
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,539
but it's just not simply spoken about.

223
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,199
It's not something that's being dealt with.

224
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,079
And eventually what begins to happen

225
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,259
is other things begin to take priority

226
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,319
and precedence,

227
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,079
and before too long,

228
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,019
they've not taken that active role of engagement

229
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,399
that they would make them known

230
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,519
to their children.

231
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,299
You know, the reality is that just because

232
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,259
we serve God doesn't mean

233
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,399
that our children will serve God.

234
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,379
It doesn't mean that.

235
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,799
Begin to think about

236
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,999
these statements in verse 4 and 5

237
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,879
and thinking about the active engagement

238
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,579
that is required

239
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,119
of not hiding them from their children,

240
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,759
of making them known to their children.

241
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,999
It takes work.

242
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,339
It takes discipline.

243
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,339
It requires that we are strategic

244
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,619
about what we're doing

245
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,979
and how we're approaching

246
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,259
the subject at hand.

247
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,259
And this evening, I'd like to consider

248
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,619
just a couple of thoughts from this passage of Scripture.

249
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,479
Number one, consider our responsibility.

250
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,039
Consider our responsibility.

251
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,559
It says in verse 4,

252
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,579
we will not hide them from their children.

253
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,399
And then notice the rest of the verse.

254
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,879
It says, showing to the generation to come

255
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,759
the praises of the Lord

256
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,099
and His strength

257
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,319
and His wonderful works

258
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,759
that He hath done.

259
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,119
Let's begin to detail and outline

260
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,719
this verse of Scripture here in verse 4.

261
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,059
And we'll continue to look at some other verses

262
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,139
here in just a moment,

263
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,439
but I want you to understand

264
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,699
that it starts out in verse 4

265
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,699
by saying showing to the generation to come

266
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,139
the praises of the Lord.

267
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,339
Literally, that phrase,

268
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,539
if you're to study it out,

269
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,139
it really has the idea of hymns.

270
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,839
And you think about the book of Psalms

271
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,819
being the Jewish songbook, if you will,

272
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,219
and using the hymns

273
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,419
and showing to the generation to come

274
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,939
the praises of the Lord.

275
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,679
They would often sing the hymns

276
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,339
as praises to God

277
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,019
and as they would sing the hymns

278
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,459
as they were praising God

279
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,619
and exalting God,

280
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,099
they were showing to that generation to come

281
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,559
the praises of the Lord

282
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,159
and the importance of praising God.

283
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,599
Listen, He is worthy of our praise.

284
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,019
We find that we've mentioned that many times

285
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,759
throughout the course of the ministry

286
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,039
and understanding as we study the Word of God

287
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,439
that our God is worthy of our praise.

288
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,599
He says that we're to show it

289
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,879
to the generation to come,

290
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,039
showing to the generation to come

291
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,999
the praise of the Lord.

292
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,039
Then notice the statement,

293
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,639
and His strength.

294
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,699
Our God is the Lord God omnipotent.

295
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,299
He indeed reigns.

296
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,059
We find that He has revealed Himself

297
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:01,339
throughout His Word by various names

298
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,699
that have been ascribed to Him.

299
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,119
And we find in so doing

300
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,059
that He is revealing certain attributes

301
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,979
or characteristics about Himself.

302
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:12,379
And we find that one that I just so appreciate

303
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,099
is when He comes to Abram

304
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:19,099
and He says that He is the Lord God Almighty.

305
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,419
El Shaddai.

306
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,879
And before you ever read of God asking Abraham

307
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,999
if anything is too hard for the Lord,

308
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:32,079
we find that God first revealed Himself

309
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,199
to Abraham as being El Shaddai,

310
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,119
the Lord God Almighty.

311
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,319
And He is the Lord God Almighty.

312
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,139
He is able to do exceeding abundantly

313
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,679
above all that we ask or think.

314
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,579
We understand that He is the strong one,

315
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:47,839
the mighty one.

316
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,599
El Elyon is one of the names

317
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,539
that's given in the Scriptures

318
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,939
in speaking about His might and His power.

319
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,099
And we begin to think about

320
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,179
how we need to influence a generation to come

321
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,619
in showing them that our God is mighty.

322
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,379
That He's able to do all things.

323
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,539
We find that the psalmist continues here

324
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,939
in verse number four and says,

325
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:13,179
"'Not only the praises of the Lord

326
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,939
"'and His strength, but notice His wonderful works

327
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,739
"'that He hath done.'"

328
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,079
I want to think about this

329
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,199
from two perspectives here this evening.

330
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,359
When we think about the end of verse number four

331
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,959
and consider the wonderful works that He hath done,

332
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,019
number one, I would say the first category

333
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,159
that we ought to deal with are biblical works.

334
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,839
Listen, I'm thankful as you study the Bible

335
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,039
that you get to see the mighty works of God.

336
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,879
Amen?

337
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,839
You study through the Scripture

338
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,479
and you begin to see the wonderful works of God

339
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,839
starting in the book of Genesis with creation.

340
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,119
And you begin to see how that God

341
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,599
created everything out of nothing

342
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,279
and God spoke and He said and it was done.

343
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,819
And you begin to reveal the mighty works of God

344
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,459
and you begin to follow the Scriptures

345
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,759
and you begin to read of all that God has done

346
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,259
and His wonderful works

347
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,259
and how through studying the works of God,

348
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:03,219
He is revealing His power, His ability.

349
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,859
He's showing to the people who He is

350
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,579
and what He is capable of doing.

351
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,339
Obviously this evening as we could go around the room

352
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,299
and we could have each one

353
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,619
within the auditorium this evening

354
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,599
share a wonderful work of our God.

355
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,799
Biblically speaking.

356
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,479
I mean, you think about the plagues.

357
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,399
You think about the parting of the Red Sea.

358
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,379
You think about the manna that came from heaven.

359
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:28,839
You think about the water that was healed.

360
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,679
You think about the water that came from the rock.

361
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,579
I mean, we could just go on and on and on.

362
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,999
We could see there's so many wonderful works of God

363
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,919
and you can see that the Scriptures

364
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,159
contain for us a record of the mighty works of God.

365
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,779
I believe this evening that our children need to know

366
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,719
what God has done.

367
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,319
They need to know the biblical works.

368
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,119
They need to know that He is mighty

369
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,559
and He's done these things.

370
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,059
The reality this evening,

371
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,759
and though there have been some that have used the term

372
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,159
and I do my very best to avoid using the term story

373
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,599
when we're speaking about a biblical record,

374
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
I very much purpose to use the phrase

375
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,979
account or record.

376
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:17,819
Why?

377
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:21,099
Because story carries with it the idea

378
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,739
of it's just a story.

379
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,399
And they read stories all the time

380
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,379
that are make-believe stories, right?

381
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:33,099
We know that there are shows on the videos

382
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,979
that people have put out and organizations have created

383
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:38,479
and books for little kids and it's all make-believe,

384
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,779
it's all stories.

385
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,879
But when we come to the Word of God,

386
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,659
it's like nothing else.

387
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,479
These are biblical accounts,

388
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,999
the record that God has given us,

389
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,399
and I purpose to use that terminology,

390
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,239
why?

391
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,359
Because words matter and I wanna make sure

392
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,999
that people that would hear me would understand

393
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,579
that this is an account that God has given us.

394
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,379
This is a record of what God has done.

395
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,159
There's something about Jonah.

396
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,199
You know how many people deny the biblical record of Jonah?

397
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,119
One preacher said this,

398
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,199
I believe the Bible so thoroughly

399
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,119
that if the Bible told me that Jonah swallowed the whale,

400
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,679
I'd believe it.

401
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,199
Amen.

402
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,039
Amen.

403
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,479
But I want you to think about this

404
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,279
when we think about the wonderful works that he hath done.

405
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,839
Yes, biblical works.

406
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,279
But let me say this, the second category is this,

407
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,799
personal, personal.

408
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,259
Why do I say that?

409
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,699
Well, I believe that when we begin to share

410
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,459
with our children, with the generation to come,

411
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:51,459
personally, what God has done for us,

412
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:54,179
it has a huge impact.

413
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,139
It is relatable.

414
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:59,659
It's no longer just that God did this for Abraham,

415
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,859
and Moses, and David, and Daniel, and Paul,

416
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,059
and John, and you fill in all the other Bible characters.

417
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,579
It's no, God's still working today.

418
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,239
God's still working in our lives.

419
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,159
God's still doing something.

420
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,359
He's still on his throne.

421
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,399
He's not changed.

422
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,079
He's immutable, and he still answers prayer,

423
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,539
and he still works, and he still saves,

424
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,879
and we begin to share with our children

425
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:28,119
and the generation to come that our God still reigns.

426
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,079
And it's no longer just looking to the far distant past

427
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,059
of what God did for some people

428
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,299
that are dead for centuries,

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,839
but what God is doing in my life.

430
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,959
And let me tell you, a generation to come needs to hear it.

431
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,760
Listen, when we have testimony time,

432
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,479
and I'm not chiding anyone this evening,

433
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,559
but when we have testimony time, listen,

434
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,880
there's some little ears that hear the testimonies,

435
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,279
and they need to hear that we are a people

436
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,519
that are ready to lift up our voice and praise our God.

437
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,959
The Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so.

438
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:04,799
Amen?

439
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,919
And we ought to be able to, at any moment in our lives

440
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:11,059
as we're walking with God, as we're abiding in Him,

441
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,260
as we're living for Him, we ought to at any moment

442
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,019
in our lives be able to stand up and say,

443
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,859
look at what God is doing in my life.

444
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,839
Let me show you what God is teaching me.

445
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,700
Let me show you how God has revealed Himself.

446
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,339
Let me share with you some prayers that God has answered.

447
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,820
Let me show you, and we begin to see

448
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,419
how that impacts a future generation.

449
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,260
Why?

450
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,299
Because they see that God is real in Mommy and Daddy's life.

451
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,919
They see that God is real

452
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,779
in their Sunday school teacher's life,

453
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,320
in their junior church teacher's life,

454
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,599
in their student ministry, in their pastor,

455
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,359
in another church member.

456
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,880
They see that God is active, and He's working,

457
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,099
and He's alive, and He's real.

458
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,279
They need to see that.

459
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,119
Why?

460
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,320
Because they're hearing God's not real.

461
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,080
That's just a religion, and that's outdated.

462
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
That's what they're hearing.

463
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,560
But no, no, look at what God's doing in my life, look at how He's working in my life.

464
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,360
We've had things that as a family we've prayed about that we did not share with other people

465
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,520
so that they could see and hear how God has worked and what God has done.

466
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,000
I shy away from using too many personal examples.

467
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,800
I try to be very transparent from the pulpit, but there have been times in our lives that

468
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:39,540
we have seen God work in such amazing ways, and our kids have been able to see that.

469
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,080
As a church family, we've been able to see that.

470
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me just use a couple of examples.

471
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll use one from several years ago.

472
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,560
We had a situation, and a couple of these will be financial-type things, but we had

473
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,720
a situation where there was a financial situation, we paid for something, and we were supposed

474
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,320
to be refunded for it, and it was just a fiasco.

475
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,520
You ever had that situation?

476
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,400
Listen, once they have your money, it's tough getting it back, right?

477
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,240
We've gone through some type of situation like that.

478
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,600
And this particular situation just started to be a real thorn in my side.

479
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,560
It just really started to bother me, honestly.

480
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm being very transparent.

481
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,120
It just started to bother me, because what was happening is they weren't being, they're

482
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,040
not operating with integrity, and it was making me angry.

483
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:31,960
And then one morning in devotions, it was as if God just said, don't worry about it.

484
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,680
In fact, this is how I believe God spoke to me.

485
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,760
He said, take that same amount and give it to missions.

486
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm trying to get my money back.

487
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,240
And it was as if God just said, you know what, that amount of money that you're worried about,

488
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,260
I want you to write a check and give it to missions.

489
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,620
It was a Sunday morning, and without delay, I went to Holly.

490
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
She's not here tonight.

491
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,700
But without delay, I went to Holly, and I said, here's what God's impressed by my heart.

492
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,660
And I said, I think we need to do it right away.

493
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
No delay.

494
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,980
She said, let's do it.

495
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,820
Put in the offer for missions.

496
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,260
Didn't really think about it.

497
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,580
Got the refund from the company that was supposed to give us the money.

498
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,820
And then I got a refund on our credit card.

499
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
I was like, what is that about?

500
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
It was an error.

501
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,180
So I contacted the credit card company and said, hey, there's a refund for this amount.

502
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,260
It was almost the exact same dollar amount.

503
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,980
I said, I don't know what this refund is about.

504
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,660
They said, oh, it looks like it's from, and they named the company that it was from.

505
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,860
I was like, why would they be sending me a refund?

506
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
So I contacted the company.

507
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:44,180
And they're like, oh, yeah, about nine months ago, you traveled with us, and we overcharged

508
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,700
you.

509
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,060
And we were doing an audit, and we found out we overcharged you, and so we refunded you

510
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
that amount.

511
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,420
It's amazing.

512
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
I think about the parsonage.

513
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,500
I mentioned last Wednesday evening, the parsonage has been paid off.

514
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
The mortgage is paid off.

515
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's amazing.

516
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,820
To God be the glory.

517
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,660
When we first started that project to build that parsonage, we believed God was in it.

518
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,600
As a church family, we met, we prayed, we saw the face of God.

519
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,360
We were met with obstacles, no doubt.

520
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,280
But every step of the way, God just worked.

521
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,600
God answered prayer.

522
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,200
There's one particular moment, and just a few people in here know this story.

523
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,300
The builder absorbed two price increases during our contract period because of the amount

524
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,360
of time that it took for us to get through the county approvals.

525
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,980
Let that just sink in for a minute.

526
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,040
The builder absorbed two price increases.

527
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,560
Who does that?

528
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Contractually, they had every right to come back to us and increase the cost.

529
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,000
The contract is always written in the favor of the party that's entering into the agreement,

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,280
not our side of it, right?

531
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,920
And we find that in this particular case, they just absorbed them.

532
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,280
The president of the company calls me and says,

533
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,520
listen, there's another $25,000 price increase on lumber.

534
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,399
You remember in COVID time when lumber was going through the roof?

535
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,800
And they said this, they said, Pastor Mann, there's nothing we can do.

536
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,640
We've already absorbed two price increases.

537
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,860
There's nothing we can do.

538
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:36,480
We have to at least split this with you.

539
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,440
I didn't at the time want to bring it before the church and cause alarm.

540
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm just being very transparent.

541
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,600
And we just began to pray, just our family.

542
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,679
And maybe this is silly or foolish, but here's how I prayed.

543
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,760
I prayed, God, the builder doesn't really need more money.

544
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,240
The lumber company doesn't really need more money.

545
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,040
God, we're trying to be good stewards.

546
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,360
We're trying to do the work of the Lord.

547
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,600
We're trying to be good stewards.

548
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,080
We're trying to give to missions and keep our missions a priority.

549
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,679
And I just poured out my heart before God in just the only way I know how to.

550
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,920
And as a family, the five of us, we just prayed.

551
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,160
It was like three weeks, no anything.

552
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,119
Now, those of you that know my background in the corporate world,

553
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,000
supply chain was my niche.

554
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,679
It's what I did.

555
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,240
So immediately upon price increase, man, I had like nine options for

556
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,679
them of what we could do so that we don't have to absorb the price increase.

557
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,000
We can do this, this, this, this, and

558
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,520
this because I did it all the time when I worked in the corporate world.

559
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,800
And we found out, x, x, x, x, x, it's not gonna work.

560
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
None of those things were accepted.

561
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
But you know what I found out?

562
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,720
It's so that God would get the glory.

563
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,000
It wasn't my wisdom of, I worked in supply chain and so let's do this.

564
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,040
About three weeks pass, the president of the company calls me.

565
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,480
She said, Pastor, man, I just want to let you know we got another quote.

566
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,200
And the increase of the lumber wasn't 25,000, it was only 12,500.

567
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,760
So we just decided we'd absorb it.

568
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,119
We finished the building project.

569
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,399
We ended up borrowing 25% of what we thought we'd borrow.

570
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:33,600
And within 15 months of being in the house, it's paid off.

571
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
It's just amazing.

572
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,320
I know that's a financial story, but

573
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,040
it's amazing to see how God works and what God is able to do.

574
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,000
I preached a message two weeks ago on Sunday night, and

575
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,360
I preached the message about the church, many members, one body.

576
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,000
And I said, if you were here, you'll remember that I made the statement

577
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,839
that we have to understand, we have to be mindful and

578
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,559
remember the purpose of his church.

579
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,399
And I really spent some time kind of evaluating how we're doing on the three

580
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,399
fold purpose that I provided you with.

581
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,880
And I said, I feel like we do a pretty good job of exalting the Lord Jesus Christ.

582
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,480
I really do.

583
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm not being boastful or prideful or patting anyone on the back, but

584
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,960
I feel like we do a pretty good job of exalting the Lord Jesus Christ and

585
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,080
understanding that what we do is for his honor and for his glory.

586
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,160
And I seek that the ministries that we have, the things that we do,

587
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,920
that they're engaging the people of God to bring honor and glory to his name.

588
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,480
I said that we're to edify the brethren.

589
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,080
I said, I feel like we do a pretty good job at that.

590
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,040
Again, not saying that in either one of those areas that we've arrived,

591
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,960
that we have no improvement to make.

592
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
But I said, I feel like we've done a pretty good job,

593
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
if we honestly evaluate it.

594
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,880
And then I said this, we're to evangelize the lost.

595
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,360
And if you were here, you heard me say, I think we're doing miserable.

596
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,980
We're failing.

597
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,440
That was what I said to you transparently.

598
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,760
I began to pray that God would give me an opportunity.

599
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,320
On Monday morning, a man comes here to do something

600
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,679
that's never been here before.

601
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,839
And I got to spend 20 minutes in that foyer sharing the gospel with him.

602
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,679
And I was just saying, thank you, Jesus, thank you.

603
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,360
Thank you for that divine appointment.

604
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,160
So guess what I got to do?

605
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,479
I got to go home and I got to tell Holly and the kids how I had this opportunity.

606
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,239
And how, look, he didn't get saved, I wish he did.

607
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,520
But when I asked him about being saved and about why Jesus died, he had no idea.

608
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,000
We could go on and on this evening of how God's worked in our lives as individuals.

609
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,880
But I want you to understand, for sake of time, I'm gonna keep moving on.

610
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,359
But I want you to understand that we have a responsibility

611
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,679
to influence a future generation.

612
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,359
And we must let them know about the wonderful works of God.

613
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,479
And it's, yes, the biblical works, but there better be some personal things.

614
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,840
Listen, prove God, prove God.

615
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,720
That's what he says in the book of Malachi.

616
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,640
He says, prove me, prove me.

617
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,559
God's not gonna fail, he's not gonna fail.

618
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,960
There should be some things as families that we pray about, that we're proving God.

619
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,160
And our kids get to see that God is real.

620
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,479
They get to see the mighty hand of God.

621
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,840
Psalm 145, if you hold your place there in Psalm 78 and look over at Psalm 145,

622
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,200
look at just a couple of verses here.

623
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,440
In verse number four, we'll look at verse number three.

624
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,080
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, his greatness is unsearchable.

625
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,440
One generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts.

626
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works.

627
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,880
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts.

628
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,680
I will declare thy greatness.

629
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,240
Those are some great verses of scripture

630
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,280
in Psalm 145, verses three through six.

631
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
And you see there where it says,

632
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
one generation shall praise thy works to another.

633
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,360
And we begin to share with the future generation

634
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,720
the wonderful works that he hath done.

635
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,040
Back in Psalm 78, it says in verse number six,

636
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,800
verse number five, for he established a testimony

637
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,340
on Jacob, appointed a law on Israel,

638
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
which he commended our fathers,

639
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,120
that they should make them known to their children.

640
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,160
It's always been God's plan that his people

641
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,000
influence the next generation.

642
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,400
It's been his plan, it's been the purpose.

643
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,740
We find that as we look at the word of God

644
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,280
and we find that there in Psalm 145,

645
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,960
where he talks about the works of God

646
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,280
and the greatness of God.

647
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,040
Listen, we serve a great God there in Psalm 78.

648
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,400
If you look over maybe on the same page in Psalm 77,

649
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,260
in verse number 14, the Bible says,

650
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,020
thou art the God that doest wonders.

651
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

652
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,940
Listen, our God, he doeth wondrous things.

653
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,920
We ought to talk to our kids about when we got saved.

654
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,500
Amen?

655
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,460
You know, for some of us,

656
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,300
our kids don't know anything about Egypt.

657
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,940
I don't mean about the country on the map.

658
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,960
I mean about the typology in the Scriptures.

659
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,720
There's some kids that don't know anything about Egypt.

660
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,420
You know what happened to that generation

661
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,320
that rose up in the book of Deuteronomy?

662
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,780
They didn't know anything about Egypt,

663
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,660
so you know what they wanted to do?

664
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,180
They wanted to go back to Egypt.

665
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,820
Because they didn't know anything about it.

666
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,660
And guess what?

667
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,320
Egypt has some attraction.

668
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,420
Can we be transparent this evening?

669
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,460
Egypt has some attraction.

670
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,680
You know what the Bible says in Hebrews 11?

671
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,980
There's pleasure in sin for a season.

672
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,140
Right?

673
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,900
And there's some attraction, and guess what?

674
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,340
There's some young people

675
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,980
that they don't know anything about Egypt,

676
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,740
and they don't hear mom and dad

677
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,220
talk about what God saved them from,

678
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,300
or what mom and dad or their parents,

679
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,620
what grandma and grandpa got saved from,

680
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,820
and how God changed their life and changed the course

681
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,600
and the godly heritage that they have.

682
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,740
Why?

683
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,580
Because we're not sharing it with them.

684
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,779
They need to know.

685
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,779
The kids in our church,

686
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:22,779
they need to know how God changed our lives,

687
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,220
how God saved us and changed the course of our lives.

688
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:33,740
We got a generation that's growing up in church,

689
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,740
and they're leaving as soon as they graduate high school.

690
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,279
You can look at all the statistics.

691
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,540
There are books that have been written on it.

692
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,980
I don't endorse everything.

693
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,260
Not only, I don't endorse everything

694
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,300
that Ken Ham or Answers in Genesis has put out,

695
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,180
but he's written a couple of books

696
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,300
on the generation that's left.

697
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Good stuff.

698
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,059
And we can't just continue to put our head in the sand

699
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,340
and act like, well, it's gonna change.

700
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,380
We gotta be active,

701
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,220
because the reason that the generation is leaving

702
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,580
is because they're being indoctrinated.

703
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,779
And those seeds of doubt are being sown.

704
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,779
And they're saying, I don't need this.

705
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,700
And it's sad.

706
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,940
As a pastor, it breaks my heart.

707
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,720
See, I think it's the same to all 17.

708
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,700
I remember going to Bible college,

709
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,100
supposed to be with the cream of the crop,

710
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,020
so to speak, as they would say.

711
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,180
Those that feel like, listen,

712
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,740
I didn't go to a biblical college

713
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,500
that had all sorts of majors

714
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,980
and all sorts of arenas of life.

715
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,100
I went to a Bible college

716
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,860
that you were studying for ministry.

717
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,180
That was the only majors we had,

718
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,380
Bible, pastoral, theology, missions.

719
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,980
And then there were some Christian education stuff.

720
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,820
That was it.

721
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,820
And I remember sitting in class

722
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,380
with guys that grew up in church.

723
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,279
I had just got saved.

724
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,300
I started Bible college one year in the Lord.

725
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,200
My spiritual birthday, I was one in the Lord,

726
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,360
and I sat in my first Bible college class.

727
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,980
And I remember in the dorms,

728
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,399
guys that were just over it, so to speak.

729
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,559
Oh, yeah, they knew it.

730
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,940
But they wanted to go do something else.

731
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,760
They wanted to go see what the world had to offer.

732
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,700
They wanted to go drink.

733
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,160
They wanted to go participate in immoral activity.

734
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,119
They wanted to do all these things.

735
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,820
And I'm like, man, I was in public school my whole life.

736
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,380
I saw that stuff.

737
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,119
Why would you want that?

738
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,959
Somebody along the way didn't tell them

739
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,360
what Egypt was all about.

740
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,320
Notice not only the responsibility.

741
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,600
I got just a couple of minutes.

742
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,959
Consider the results.

743
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,260
Look at verse number seven in Psalm 78.

744
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,279
It says this in verse six,

745
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:59,520
that the generation to come might know them.

746
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
Everything that we just looked at,

747
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,679
even the children which should be born,

748
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,559
who should arise and declare them to their children.

749
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,059
Do you see the generational impact?

750
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,540
This is God's plan.

751
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:11,520
It's that my parents would teach me

752
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,239
the truth that we find here in this passage,

753
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,480
and that I would teach my children,

754
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,800
and then my children would teach the grandchildren,

755
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
and so on and so forth.

756
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,320
That's the way God designed it to work.

757
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,600
We find in verse number seven, it says that they,

758
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
that generation to come,

759
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,580
that they might, number one, set their hope in God.

760
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,559
Isn't that what we want?

761
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,220
Listen, there's no hope apart from God.

762
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,520
We live in the midst of a society that's hopeless.

763
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,020
It says that they might set their hope in God.

764
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,360
By the way, you'll never be disappointed with God.

765
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,559
I'm not saying your life will be perfect.

766
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,779
I'm not saying that you'll have no trials or troubles,

767
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,279
but isn't it good knowing when you go through

768
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:00,399
the trial and trouble that God has a purpose in it?

769
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,360
Amen?

770
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,619
Do you remember when you were lost,

771
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,959
and you went through trials and troubles,

772
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,220
and you just didn't know what was going on?

773
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,760
You're at the end of your rope.

774
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,440
All the stuff that was going on, but now in Christ,

775
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,720
man, when I have a trouble, when I have a trial,

776
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,800
it's God's in control, and God has a purpose,

777
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
and God has a plan, and he's trying to draw me to himself.

778
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,140
He's trying to teach me something.

779
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,880
He's growing me and developing me.

780
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,200
He's working to bring glory to himself.

781
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,459
Man, it gives us a completely different perspective

782
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,559
on trials and troubles.

783
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,320
God will not fail.

784
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,059
He never has, and you will not be the first

785
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:38,660
that God fails on, amen?

786
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,760
Great is thy faithfulness, we sing the song.

787
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,380
God is faithful.

788
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,899
Notice this in verse seven.

789
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,820
And not forget the works of God.

790
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,000
You know, it's interesting when you read that phrase,

791
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,959
the word forget can carry with it the idea

792
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,720
of what we would use when we say forget.

793
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,020
We've forgotten something,

794
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,059
but it also carries with it this idea.

795
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,020
This word in the Hebrew carries with it this idea,

796
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,020
a ceasing to care, ceasing to care.

797
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,500
Now think about that just for a moment.

798
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
It says that they might sit there hoping God

799
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,660
and not forget the works of God.

800
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,279
Here's what I find in our own lives

801
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:26,380
and in the lives of the generation to come.

802
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,420
It's not that somebody has forgotten

803
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,179
that God parted the Red Sea.

804
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:31,660
It's not that somebody's forgotten

805
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,500
that they've been bought with a price.

806
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,700
It's not that somebody's forgotten

807
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,339
that Jesus is coming again.

808
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,260
It's just that we're not mindful of it.

809
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,700
I said that a couple of weeks ago,

810
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,720
and it's been so impactful in my life personally

811
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,540
that every day I have to be mindful of the promises of God.

812
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,700
Listen, when the psalmist says in Psalm 119,

813
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,899
I will not forget thy works.

814
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,300
How do you make such a statement?

815
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,739
We've all forgotten something.

816
00:37:57,739 --> 00:37:59,459
You say, man, I forgot something today.

817
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:01,700
Man, if it wasn't, Miss Jackie says,

818
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm losing my marbles.

819
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,980
And listen, we have things that we do, right?

820
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,380
You tie a string, you do this, we got phones.

821
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,540
Then you put a note in your phone

822
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,820
and you forget where you put it, right?

823
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,580
You put something and then you do the search feature

824
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,260
and the search feature doesn't work.

825
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,100
Anyone relate?

826
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,920
You know what I'm saying?

827
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,980
And we forget things.

828
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,420
So how can the psalmist says, I will not forget?

829
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,739
You gotta be actively engaged on reminding yourself.

830
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,700
You gotta be in it.

831
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,940
And you gotta let it get in you.

832
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,020
Amen?

833
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,780
And then as you're in it and it's in you,

834
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,820
you're not gonna forget.

835
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,260
You're gonna know that God's able.

836
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,739
Listen, it's a sad thing to me

837
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:40,700
when a child of God faces a crisis in their life

838
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,859
and they have nothing that they can hold on to.

839
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:45,700
Why?

840
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,380
Because they've been a stranger to this book.

841
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,739
They've been a stranger to the throne room of God.

842
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,140
They have nothing in their life

843
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,900
that they are actively seeing God work

844
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,179
and they enter into a crisis and their world falls apart.

845
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,859
I've seen it too many times.

846
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,000
And then you talk to the believer that's abiding in Him,

847
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,580
that's enjoying sweet fellowship with Him

848
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,940
and they have a crisis in their life

849
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,700
and they say, oh, I'm trusting God.

850
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,220
Here's what He did in the life of,

851
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,619
here's what He did in the life of,

852
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,020
here's what He's done for me before.

853
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,960
And then they have hope,

854
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,780
they have confidence that God's gonna work,

855
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,940
that God's gonna do something.

856
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,140
Why?

857
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,340
Because they've seen it.

858
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,619
They've proved God.

859
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,220
We find that it says, keep His commandments

860
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,660
at the end of verse number seven,

861
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
but keep His commandments.

862
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,979
Don't we want our children,

863
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:41,059
don't we want the generation to come to be obedient to God?

864
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,059
There's a blessing in obedience.

865
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,539
Notice back in verse number six in the last statement,

866
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:53,559
who should arise and declare them to their children.

867
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,299
You know, somewhere along the way,

868
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,260
our churches have been.

869
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:05,220
failed as believers. Honestly, if we just be honest and evaluate, there's a generation

870
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:11,940
that's missing, there's a failure that we must own, and we must learn from it. And we

871
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,260
understand this evening that when we consider this generation to come, we consider the responsibility,

872
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:25,100
we consider the results, that we must be mindful of the fact that our God is eternal, so He

873
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:31,340
spans every generation. I have the ability to influence the generation that God would

874
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,580
give me the opportunity to influence, but there comes a point where my influence is

875
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,940
going to end because I'm going to go home to be with the Lord. Amen? And none of us

876
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,180
know when that's going to be, by the way. Some of you that are much older than me, I

877
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,380
could die before you. We can go to the cemetery and the graveyard and you can find gravestone

878
00:40:51,380 --> 00:41:00,540
markers with ages that span the spectrum, right? So we don't know. But the God who's

879
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:07,700
outside of time, the God who spans every generation, the eternal God, He's promised to preserve

880
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,980
His Word from generation to generation. And as we would encourage our children, as we'd

881
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,500
encourage them to, this generation to come, to set their hope in God, as we would give

882
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,460
them the, teach them about the wonderful works of God, and we teach them to keep their

883
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:32,340
eyes on God, they will have the truth that God spans every generation. Moses said this

884
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,020
in Psalm 90 and verse number 2, before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou

885
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:42,380
hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art

886
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:50,140
God. Let me remind you of what it says in the book of Lamentations. If you want to turn

887
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:59,900
there, we'll finish with this text of Scripture. Jeremiah, Lamentations. Lamentations chapter

888
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:07,380
number 5. I'm just going to look at one verse of Scripture and we'll close this evening.

889
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,300
As we seek to influence and reach the generation to come, when we understand that we must have

890
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:19,820
active engagement, we must be purposed, we must be disciplined. Listen, I understand

891
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:26,980
that life is busy. Amen? Pierre's not in here right now, but I sent him a text yesterday

892
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,520
with a picture of Joseph and Zachary. Kimberly, did you see that picture? They were standing

893
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,080
right here on the platform. Joseph was like 14 inches shorter than he is right now. And

894
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,760
Zachary was like, he was standing as like this tall. And on that particular Sunday,

895
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,600
they both had orange shirts on and black dress pants and a tie that was very similar. So,

896
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,320
they got a picture right here together. If I remember correctly, it was just three years

897
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,760
ago. But man, when you look at that picture, you say, man, how the time flies. Listen,

898
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,680
if we're not purposed in this thing of influencing the next generation before we know it, the

899
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,740
opportunity is gone. Tony, our daughters are graduating high school this year. I remember

900
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,920
when they first started singing up here in children's church. I remember just like we

901
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,080
looked at those kids. I know I got one that's married, but Brianna's here right now. I remember

902
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,560
watching our kids in our church sing up here and I remember Kiademe and Brianna. I got

903
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:33,680
pictures. They're this tall. Little girls just like Natalie and Lydia. We know how time

904
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,560
goes and we have an opportunity. Notice what Lamentations 5 and verse 19 says about our

905
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,320
God. Again, the one who spans every generation, the one whose hope we're seeking to have our

906
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,120
children set their hope in this God. It says in verse number 19 of Lamentations 5, thou,

907
00:43:52,120 --> 00:44:03,640
O Lord, remainest forever. Thy throne from generation to generation. There's coming a

908
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,200
day, and I don't know when the day is, but if it should go according to what I would

909
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,520
think or what a natural process would be, that my children will no longer have me as

910
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,839
their father here personally in body. I will go home to be with the Lord. Amen? I hope

911
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:26,200
I go home to be with the Lord before my children. I know it doesn't always work that way. I

912
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,520
understand that, but that would be my desire. There's coming a day that I will not be the

913
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,160
pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church anymore. It's going to happen. As much as we want to

914
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,660
combat father time and whatever terminology we want to use, the reality is that at some

915
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:53,779
point, I'm going to pass away. I'm going to be home with the Lord. But God is forever. He's

916
00:44:53,779 --> 00:45:01,059
eternal. As we teach these young people, this generation to come, listen, don't just look to

917
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:11,700
me. Look to God. God will not fail you. I may. God will never be wrong. I'm wrong. Right? We're

918
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:21,300
all men. We're all human beings. We've all erred. He's perfect. And when I'm in glory,

919
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,220
I hope the people that God has allowed me to influence are continuing to serve the one

920
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:37,300
who is eternal. The generation to come, listen, there is a battle that is raging. They're

921
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:52,980
no longer being discreet about it. They are putting their agenda in our face. Our warfare

922
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:59,940
is not carnal. It's spiritual. We serve the God Almighty who is able, and we need to be

923
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:08,500
actively engaged. God, how can I? God, how can you use me? Is there some small way, God,

924
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:19,380
that you can use me to have an influence in the future generation? God, use me so that they would

925
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,540
see that you're real, that you're still working. They would understand what you're capable of

926
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,820
doing, and that they would set their hope in you, that they would serve you, they would obey you,

927
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:39,700
because there's a generation to come. And for too long, there's a generation that's come and gone.

928
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:47,940
I trust that God would help us tonight to recognize our responsibility, to pray for the results,

929
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:55,140
and to see God do what only He can do, that we would be actively engaged in reaching a generation

930
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:02,900
to come. Let's pray. Father, how we love you. No doubt in our own lives, there are times in which

931
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:10,660
we wonder how we could ever do this or that. We see a need, but we don't know what we could do

932
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:16,980
or how to approach it. I'm so thankful that you've given us your Word. And then in this simple

933
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:23,380
passage of Scripture in Psalm 78, it's so powerful because it's truth. It's your precious Word. You've

934
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:29,779
provided for us in these verses of Scripture a pattern to follow. I pray God that you'd help

935
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:36,980
us to be actively engaged. You'd help us, Lord, to be mindful of the work that is required, the diligence.

936
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,020
We cannot take off. We cannot be absent.

937
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,580
We must be engaged. Lord, I pray that this evening you'd stir the hearts of your people.

938
00:47:53,540 --> 00:48:00,100
And God, we'd seek and make ourselves available that you would use us to influence a future

939
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,140
generation. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
