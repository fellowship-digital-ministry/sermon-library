00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
the book of Psalms this evening, Psalm 78.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.519
And I'll be looking here at the first eight verses,

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.000
Psalm 78, verses one through eight.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.760
And I'll read the verses of scripture

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.600
and we'll get into the message this evening,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.439
Psalm 78, verses one through eight.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.479
I've titled the message tonight, The Generation to Come.

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.959
And I am thankful that we have an opportunity

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:24.879
to influence a future generation, amen.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.079
And we had the privilege this evening

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.680
of seeing a future generation stand here

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.360
on our platform, of course, in just a couple of Sundays.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.000
On October the ninth, we're going to have

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.680
a teen takeover service in our evening service.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.459
And we'll have the opportunity to see a generation

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.700
between ours and that one, the teenagers.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.080
And we'll have the privilege of being able

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.919
to see them minister and use the talents

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.279
that God has equipped them with.

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:54.000
And that thrills my heart.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880
I am so thankful for a generation to come.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.080
Notice what the psalmist says,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.880
beginning in verse number one of Psalm 78.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.680
Give ear, O my people, to my law.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.419
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:08.319
I will open my mouth and a parable

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.120
I will utter dark sayings of old,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.459
which we have heard and known

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.839
and our fathers have told us.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.680
Notice verse number four.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.839
We will not hide them from their children,

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:24.040
showing to the generation to come

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.599
the praises of the Lord and his strength

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.440
and his wonderful works that he hath done.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.160
For he established a testimony in Jacob

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.319
and appointed a law in Israel,

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.279
which he commanded our fathers

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:40.000
that they should make them known to their children,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
that the generation to come might know them,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.440
even the children which should be born,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
who should arise and declare them to their children,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.879
that they might set their hope in God

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.160
and not forget the works of God,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.120
but keep his commandments.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.800
It might not be as their fathers,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.120
a stubborn and rebellious generation,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.800
a generation that set not their heart aright

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.199
and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.519
In verse number four,

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.039
and then again in verse number six,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.119
you see that phrase, the generation to come.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.399
As I mentioned already,

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.199
I am thankful for the generation to come.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.880
I am also thankful for those that God has equipped

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.080
and called to work with the future generation.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.199
This evening, as we begin to think about the children

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.320
that were here and singing, of course,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.639
we know that we have folks that in our church

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.880
have served on Sunday mornings,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.720
those that serve in our nursery

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.559
and our children's church ministry.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.839
On Wednesday evening, we have our student ministries

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.960
and we have folks that have responded to the work

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.039
that God has done in and through their hearts and lives

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.119
and they have surrendered themselves

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.440
so that they could be used of God.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.399
They've responded to the prompting

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:52.839
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.960
And I believe that they are serving

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.919
as of the ability that God has given them.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.919
Indeed, I would say this tonight,

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.559
that it is a blessing to be laborers together with God.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.199
And what a joy to have the privilege

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:13.199
of serving God together as a team, as a body of believers.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.639
A couple of Sunday nights ago, I had the,

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.759
on Sunday night, we preached the message,

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.240
many members, but one body.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.919
And just how God has equipped each member of the body

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.479
for his purpose and to fulfill his purpose.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.080
And we were mindful of several things

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.520
on that Sunday evening.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.479
And now as we begin to think about the work

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.199
in the lives of these young people

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.360
with regard to the generation to come,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.119
I would say this evening that we must acknowledge

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.679
that there is a mighty battle that is taking place

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.880
for this generation to come.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.440
It has always been the case that there is a battle

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.320
that is raging over a future generation.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.039
But as we sit here today on the eve of the month of October

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.639
in just a few days and 2022,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.119
it's hard to believe the year is almost over.

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.279
But we see that this battle for a future generation,

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.639
for the generation to come is raging.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.559
And we must acknowledge this evening

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.639
that as we begin to consider the word of God

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.639
and the responsibility that we have to impact

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.779
and influence a future generation,

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.820
we must understand that we have the need

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.660
to be actively engaged in seeking

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.220
to influence a future generation.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.940
Active engagement is essential, it is imperative.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.380
I find this evening as we think about the church family,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.440
and obviously we have parents of children that are here

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.959
that are seeking to influence their children.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:43.660
We have workers in our church that serve in capacities

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.040
of teaching and assisting and what have you

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.760
that are seeking to influence a future generation.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.160
But the reality is that each and every one of us

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.279
ought to be engaged in having some level of influence

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:59.160
in a future generation, in the generation to come.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.299
I want you to consider this evening, as I mentioned,

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:03.559
that active engagement is required.

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.799
I want you to understand

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:07.200
that those that are in opposition to God,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.679
those that are in opposition to the word of God,

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:11.799
they are actively engaged

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:14.679
on seeking to reach the next generation.

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:17.959
And not reach the next generation like we talk about.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.899
We talk about reaching the next generation

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:21.640
for the cause of Christ

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.760
and to influence them with the word of God,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.380
but we find that there's a group of people

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.660
that are on our earth today

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.519
that are the workers of iniquity,

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.720
that are false teachers,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.640
that are seeking to capture this future generation.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.720
They're seeking to indoctrinate them.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.579
They're seeking to develop their philosophy

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:42.000
and their worldview.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.600
And we must be aware of this battle that is raging.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.720
I want you to consider this evening,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.480
by way of introduction, a couple of quotes.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.480
One from the, of course, wicked Nazi dictator Hitler.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.600
He said this,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.600
"'He alone who owns the youth gains the future.'"

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920
Yes, people are following in that exact mindset.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
"'He alone who owns the youth gains the future.'"

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.140
Why do you think there's such a battle over schooling?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.760
The Department of Education.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.839
It is a battle.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.119
And they are seeking at the youngest of age

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:37.239
to indoctrinate the future generation.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:42.000
Because he alone who owns the youth gains the future.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.760
I know that that's not Bible,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.779
but there's a lot of truth to what they said,

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:47.339
or what he said.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.359
Let me share this quote with you.

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:51.739
Atheist Lawrence Krauss said this,

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:56.959
"'Change is always one generation away.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.980
"'So if we can plant the seeds of doubt in our children,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.980
"'religion will go away in a generation,

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:14.839
"'or at least largely go away.'"

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.859
And he followed up that statement with this one.

00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:22.859
And that's what I think we have an obligation to do.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:25.679
Wow.

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:27.640
Wow.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.559
And we understand this evening,

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:33.380
the battle that is raging.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.459
Some of us at a higher level than others.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.940
Some are more aware, some have children,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.140
and you see firsthand what's taking place

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.260
and how the system that we're in,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.980
the culture that we're in is seeking to influence them

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.040
and seeking to steal their hearts

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.380
and to give them a different worldview.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.739
And we look at that quote that it said there

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:54.179
from that atheist Krauss.

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:57.679
He said that if we can plant the seeds of doubt,

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:01.299
just plant some seeds of doubt.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.040
By the way, isn't that what Satan did

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.959
in Genesis chapter number three?

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:10.959
"'Yea, hath God said, ye shall not surely die.'"

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.019
Listen, doubt is the enemy of faith.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.959
Doubt hinders.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:23.619
And we find that the influence of this society

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.940
upon a future generation is given to us,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.920
and they've put these things in writing,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.899
and we cannot put our head in the sand

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.460
and act as if they just love our children

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.020
and they just wanna teach them.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.099
Education is no longer just about English

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:42.539
and arithmetic and reading.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.820
It's no longer just about those things.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.900
And we find that there's such a battle that is raging.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.159
They are seeking not only to reach the elementary age group,

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:55.500
but now they're seeking even to reach into the preschools.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.140
And they have desires, even in the state of Virginia,

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:02.159
they have desires to give some curriculum

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:05.719
that would have this universal type of curriculum.

00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:06.559
Why?

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:07.760
So that they can control it,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.119
so that they know exactly what is being taught

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:14.880
and how they are going to indoctrinate a future generation.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.619
And so what do we do about that?

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:19.440
When we think about a generation to come,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.520
some have had this perspective,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.840
I see the need, I see that there's a departure,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.440
but I just don't know what to do.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.900
I don't know what I can do.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.380
And I believe as we begin to look at this passage

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.559
of scripture here in Psalm 78,

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.059
that we look at just a couple of thoughts this evening

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:39.219
from this passage and I hope that it would give us

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:41.859
a great burden for a generation to come,

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:43.780
that it would burden our hearts,

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.700
that God would help us to have a level of engagement

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.900
to be able to have an influence on this generation to come.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.659
I want you to notice in Psalm 78, verse number four,

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:56.239
notice the first statement here.

00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:59.919
The Bible says, we will not hide them.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:02.259
from their children.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:04.759
And then you find in verse number five,

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:06.019
at the end of the verse,

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:09.179
it says that they should make them known

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:10.759
to their children.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:13.819
Again, this requires active engagement.

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:15.059
When you think about this idea

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:17.279
of not hiding them from their children,

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:19.279
it's not the idea that they're going

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:21.899
and trying to conceal truth or hide truth,

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.539
but it's just not simply spoken about.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:26.199
It's not something that's being dealt with.

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:28.079
And eventually what begins to happen

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:30.259
is other things begin to take priority

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:31.319
and precedence,

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:33.079
and before too long,

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:36.019
they've not taken that active role of engagement

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:38.399
that they would make them known

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.519
to their children.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:44.299
You know, the reality is that just because

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:46.259
we serve God doesn't mean

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:50.399
that our children will serve God.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:53.379
It doesn't mean that.

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:56.799
Begin to think about

00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:58.999
these statements in verse 4 and 5

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:01.879
and thinking about the active engagement

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:03.579
that is required

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.119
of not hiding them from their children,

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:08.759
of making them known to their children.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.999
It takes work.

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:12.339
It takes discipline.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.339
It requires that we are strategic

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:16.619
about what we're doing

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.979
and how we're approaching

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.259
the subject at hand.

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:23.259
And this evening, I'd like to consider

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.619
just a couple of thoughts from this passage of Scripture.

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:29.479
Number one, consider our responsibility.

00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:31.039
Consider our responsibility.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.559
It says in verse 4,

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.579
we will not hide them from their children.

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:36.399
And then notice the rest of the verse.

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.879
It says, showing to the generation to come

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.759
the praises of the Lord

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.099
and His strength

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:44.319
and His wonderful works

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.759
that He hath done.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.119
Let's begin to detail and outline

00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:50.719
this verse of Scripture here in verse 4.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:53.059
And we'll continue to look at some other verses

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.139
here in just a moment,

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.439
but I want you to understand

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:56.699
that it starts out in verse 4

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:58.699
by saying showing to the generation to come

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:00.139
the praises of the Lord.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:01.339
Literally, that phrase,

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:02.539
if you're to study it out,

00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:04.139
it really has the idea of hymns.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.839
And you think about the book of Psalms

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:08.819
being the Jewish songbook, if you will,

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:10.219
and using the hymns

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:12.419
and showing to the generation to come

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:13.939
the praises of the Lord.

00:12:13.939 --> 00:12:15.679
They would often sing the hymns

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.339
as praises to God

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:19.019
and as they would sing the hymns

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:21.459
as they were praising God

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:22.619
and exalting God,

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:25.099
they were showing to that generation to come

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:26.559
the praises of the Lord

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.159
and the importance of praising God.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.599
Listen, He is worthy of our praise.

00:12:30.599 --> 00:12:33.019
We find that we've mentioned that many times

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:35.759
throughout the course of the ministry

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:38.039
and understanding as we study the Word of God

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:40.439
that our God is worthy of our praise.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.599
He says that we're to show it

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:44.879
to the generation to come,

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:47.039
showing to the generation to come

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:47.999
the praise of the Lord.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:49.039
Then notice the statement,

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:51.639
and His strength.

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:55.699
Our God is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.299
He indeed reigns.

00:12:57.299 --> 00:12:59.059
We find that He has revealed Himself

00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:01.339
throughout His Word by various names

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:02.699
that have been ascribed to Him.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.119
And we find in so doing

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:06.059
that He is revealing certain attributes

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:07.979
or characteristics about Himself.

00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:12.379
And we find that one that I just so appreciate

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:14.099
is when He comes to Abram

00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:19.099
and He says that He is the Lord God Almighty.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.419
El Shaddai.

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:25.879
And before you ever read of God asking Abraham

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:28.999
if anything is too hard for the Lord,

00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:32.079
we find that God first revealed Himself

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:35.199
to Abraham as being El Shaddai,

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:37.119
the Lord God Almighty.

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:39.319
And He is the Lord God Almighty.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.139
He is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:42.679
above all that we ask or think.

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:46.579
We understand that He is the strong one,

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:47.839
the mighty one.

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.599
El Elyon is one of the names

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:51.539
that's given in the Scriptures

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.939
in speaking about His might and His power.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.099
And we begin to think about

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:58.179
how we need to influence a generation to come

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:01.619
in showing them that our God is mighty.

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:03.379
That He's able to do all things.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:07.539
We find that the psalmist continues here

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:08.939
in verse number four and says,

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:13.179
"'Not only the praises of the Lord

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.939
"'and His strength, but notice His wonderful works

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.739
"'that He hath done.'"

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:20.079
I want to think about this

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:22.199
from two perspectives here this evening.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:24.359
When we think about the end of verse number four

00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:26.959
and consider the wonderful works that He hath done,

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.019
number one, I would say the first category

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:32.159
that we ought to deal with are biblical works.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.839
Listen, I'm thankful as you study the Bible

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.039
that you get to see the mighty works of God.

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:36.879
Amen?

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:37.839
You study through the Scripture

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:39.479
and you begin to see the wonderful works of God

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.839
starting in the book of Genesis with creation.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.119
And you begin to see how that God

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:44.599
created everything out of nothing

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:47.279
and God spoke and He said and it was done.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:50.819
And you begin to reveal the mighty works of God

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:53.459
and you begin to follow the Scriptures

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.759
and you begin to read of all that God has done

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.259
and His wonderful works

00:14:57.259 --> 00:15:00.259
and how through studying the works of God,

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:03.219
He is revealing His power, His ability.

00:15:03.219 --> 00:15:05.859
He's showing to the people who He is

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:07.579
and what He is capable of doing.

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:10.339
Obviously this evening as we could go around the room

00:15:10.339 --> 00:15:12.299
and we could have each one

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:14.619
within the auditorium this evening

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:18.599
share a wonderful work of our God.

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:19.799
Biblically speaking.

00:15:20.979 --> 00:15:22.479
I mean, you think about the plagues.

00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:24.399
You think about the parting of the Red Sea.

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:26.379
You think about the manna that came from heaven.

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:28.839
You think about the water that was healed.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:30.679
You think about the water that came from the rock.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:34.579
I mean, we could just go on and on and on.

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:37.999
We could see there's so many wonderful works of God

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.919
and you can see that the Scriptures

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:44.159
contain for us a record of the mighty works of God.

00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:49.779
I believe this evening that our children need to know

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:51.719
what God has done.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:54.319
They need to know the biblical works.

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:56.119
They need to know that He is mighty

00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:58.559
and He's done these things.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:01.059
The reality this evening,

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:03.759
and though there have been some that have used the term

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:08.159
and I do my very best to avoid using the term story

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.599
when we're speaking about a biblical record,

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.399
I very much purpose to use the phrase

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:16.979
account or record.

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:17.819
Why?

00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:21.099
Because story carries with it the idea

00:16:21.099 --> 00:16:22.739
of it's just a story.

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:25.399
And they read stories all the time

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.379
that are make-believe stories, right?

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:33.099
We know that there are shows on the videos

00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:35.979
that people have put out and organizations have created

00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:38.479
and books for little kids and it's all make-believe,

00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:40.779
it's all stories.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.879
But when we come to the Word of God,

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.659
it's like nothing else.

00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:46.479
These are biblical accounts,

00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:48.999
the record that God has given us,

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:51.399
and I purpose to use that terminology,

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:52.239
why?

00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:54.359
Because words matter and I wanna make sure

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:56.999
that people that would hear me would understand

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:59.579
that this is an account that God has given us.

00:16:59.579 --> 00:17:03.379
This is a record of what God has done.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.159
There's something about Jonah.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:10.199
You know how many people deny the biblical record of Jonah?

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.119
One preacher said this,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.199
I believe the Bible so thoroughly

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:18.119
that if the Bible told me that Jonah swallowed the whale,

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.679
I'd believe it.

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.199
Amen.

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:22.039
Amen.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.479
But I want you to think about this

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:29.279
when we think about the wonderful works that he hath done.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.839
Yes, biblical works.

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:37.279
But let me say this, the second category is this,

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:39.799
personal, personal.

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:42.259
Why do I say that?

00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:44.699
Well, I believe that when we begin to share

00:17:44.699 --> 00:17:47.459
with our children, with the generation to come,

00:17:47.459 --> 00:17:51.459
personally, what God has done for us,

00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:54.179
it has a huge impact.

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.139
It is relatable.

00:17:56.139 --> 00:17:59.659
It's no longer just that God did this for Abraham,

00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:02.859
and Moses, and David, and Daniel, and Paul,

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:06.059
and John, and you fill in all the other Bible characters.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:09.579
It's no, God's still working today.

00:18:10.159 --> 00:18:12.239
God's still working in our lives.

00:18:12.239 --> 00:18:14.159
God's still doing something.

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:15.359
He's still on his throne.

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:16.399
He's not changed.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.079
He's immutable, and he still answers prayer,

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:21.539
and he still works, and he still saves,

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:23.879
and we begin to share with our children

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:28.119
and the generation to come that our God still reigns.

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:33.079
And it's no longer just looking to the far distant past

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.059
of what God did for some people

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.299
that are dead for centuries,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.839
but what God is doing in my life.

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:44.959
And let me tell you, a generation to come needs to hear it.

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:46.760
Listen, when we have testimony time,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.479
and I'm not chiding anyone this evening,

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:51.559
but when we have testimony time, listen,

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:54.880
there's some little ears that hear the testimonies,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.279
and they need to hear that we are a people

00:18:57.279 --> 00:19:00.519
that are ready to lift up our voice and praise our God.

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:03.959
The Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so.

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:04.799
Amen?

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.919
And we ought to be able to, at any moment in our lives

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:11.059
as we're walking with God, as we're abiding in Him,

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:14.260
as we're living for Him, we ought to at any moment

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.019
in our lives be able to stand up and say,

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:18.859
look at what God is doing in my life.

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.839
Let me show you what God is teaching me.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:23.700
Let me show you how God has revealed Himself.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.339
Let me share with you some prayers that God has answered.

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.820
Let me show you, and we begin to see

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.419
how that impacts a future generation.

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:33.260
Why?

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.299
Because they see that God is real in Mommy and Daddy's life.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.919
They see that God is real

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:39.779
in their Sunday school teacher's life,

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.320
in their junior church teacher's life,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.599
in their student ministry, in their pastor,

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:46.359
in another church member.

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:48.880
They see that God is active, and He's working,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.099
and He's alive, and He's real.

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:53.279
They need to see that.

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.119
Why?

00:19:55.639 --> 00:19:58.320
Because they're hearing God's not real.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:06.080
That's just a religion, and that's outdated.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.080
That's what they're hearing.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.560
But no, no, look at what God's doing in my life, look at how He's working in my life.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.360
We've had things that as a family we've prayed about that we did not share with other people

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.520
so that they could see and hear how God has worked and what God has done.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.000
I shy away from using too many personal examples.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.800
I try to be very transparent from the pulpit, but there have been times in our lives that

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:39.540
we have seen God work in such amazing ways, and our kids have been able to see that.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.080
As a church family, we've been able to see that.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.400
Let me just use a couple of examples.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.800
I'll use one from several years ago.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.560
We had a situation, and a couple of these will be financial-type things, but we had

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.720
a situation where there was a financial situation, we paid for something, and we were supposed

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.320
to be refunded for it, and it was just a fiasco.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.520
You ever had that situation?

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.400
Listen, once they have your money, it's tough getting it back, right?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.240
We've gone through some type of situation like that.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.600
And this particular situation just started to be a real thorn in my side.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.560
It just really started to bother me, honestly.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.560
I'm being very transparent.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.120
It just started to bother me, because what was happening is they weren't being, they're

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:24.040
not operating with integrity, and it was making me angry.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:31.960
And then one morning in devotions, it was as if God just said, don't worry about it.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.680
In fact, this is how I believe God spoke to me.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.760
He said, take that same amount and give it to missions.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.120
I'm trying to get my money back.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.240
And it was as if God just said, you know what, that amount of money that you're worried about,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.260
I want you to write a check and give it to missions.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.620
It was a Sunday morning, and without delay, I went to Holly.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.620
She's not here tonight.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.700
But without delay, I went to Holly, and I said, here's what God's impressed by my heart.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.660
And I said, I think we need to do it right away.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.660
No delay.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.980
She said, let's do it.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.820
Put in the offer for missions.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.260
Didn't really think about it.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.580
Got the refund from the company that was supposed to give us the money.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.820
And then I got a refund on our credit card.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.380
I was like, what is that about?

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.380
It was an error.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.180
So I contacted the credit card company and said, hey, there's a refund for this amount.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.260
It was almost the exact same dollar amount.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.980
I said, I don't know what this refund is about.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.660
They said, oh, it looks like it's from, and they named the company that it was from.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.860
I was like, why would they be sending me a refund?

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.860
So I contacted the company.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:44.180
And they're like, oh, yeah, about nine months ago, you traveled with us, and we overcharged

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.700
you.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.060
And we were doing an audit, and we found out we overcharged you, and so we refunded you

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.060
that amount.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.420
It's amazing.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.420
I think about the parsonage.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.500
I mentioned last Wednesday evening, the parsonage has been paid off.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.500
The mortgage is paid off.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.500
It's amazing.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.820
To God be the glory.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.660
When we first started that project to build that parsonage, we believed God was in it.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.600
As a church family, we met, we prayed, we saw the face of God.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.360
We were met with obstacles, no doubt.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.280
But every step of the way, God just worked.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.600
God answered prayer.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.200
There's one particular moment, and just a few people in here know this story.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.300
The builder absorbed two price increases during our contract period because of the amount

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.360
of time that it took for us to get through the county approvals.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.980
Let that just sink in for a minute.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.040
The builder absorbed two price increases.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.560
Who does that?

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:56.640
Contractually, they had every right to come back to us and increase the cost.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.000
The contract is always written in the favor of the party that's entering into the agreement,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.280
not our side of it, right?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.920
And we find that in this particular case, they just absorbed them.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.280
The president of the company calls me and says,

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.520
listen, there's another $25,000 price increase on lumber.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.399
You remember in COVID time when lumber was going through the roof?

00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:24.800
And they said this, they said, Pastor Mann, there's nothing we can do.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.640
We've already absorbed two price increases.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.860
There's nothing we can do.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:36.480
We have to at least split this with you.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.440
I didn't at the time want to bring it before the church and cause alarm.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.880
I'm just being very transparent.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.600
And we just began to pray, just our family.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.679
And maybe this is silly or foolish, but here's how I prayed.

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:56.760
I prayed, God, the builder doesn't really need more money.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.240
The lumber company doesn't really need more money.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.040
God, we're trying to be good stewards.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.360
We're trying to do the work of the Lord.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.600
We're trying to be good stewards.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.080
We're trying to give to missions and keep our missions a priority.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.679
And I just poured out my heart before God in just the only way I know how to.

00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:21.920
And as a family, the five of us, we just prayed.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.160
It was like three weeks, no anything.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.119
Now, those of you that know my background in the corporate world,

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:31.000
supply chain was my niche.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.679
It's what I did.

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:36.240
So immediately upon price increase, man, I had like nine options for

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.679
them of what we could do so that we don't have to absorb the price increase.

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.000
We can do this, this, this, this, and

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.520
this because I did it all the time when I worked in the corporate world.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.800
And we found out, x, x, x, x, x, it's not gonna work.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.800
None of those things were accepted.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800
But you know what I found out?

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.720
It's so that God would get the glory.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.000
It wasn't my wisdom of, I worked in supply chain and so let's do this.

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:08.040
About three weeks pass, the president of the company calls me.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.480
She said, Pastor, man, I just want to let you know we got another quote.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.200
And the increase of the lumber wasn't 25,000, it was only 12,500.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.760
So we just decided we'd absorb it.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.119
We finished the building project.

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:29.399
We ended up borrowing 25% of what we thought we'd borrow.

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:33.600
And within 15 months of being in the house, it's paid off.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.440
It's just amazing.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.320
I know that's a financial story, but

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.040
it's amazing to see how God works and what God is able to do.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.000
I preached a message two weeks ago on Sunday night, and

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.360
I preached the message about the church, many members, one body.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.000
And I said, if you were here, you'll remember that I made the statement

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.839
that we have to understand, we have to be mindful and

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:06.559
remember the purpose of his church.

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:10.399
And I really spent some time kind of evaluating how we're doing on the three

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.399
fold purpose that I provided you with.

00:27:12.399 --> 00:27:16.880
And I said, I feel like we do a pretty good job of exalting the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.480
I really do.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.760
I'm not being boastful or prideful or patting anyone on the back, but

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.960
I feel like we do a pretty good job of exalting the Lord Jesus Christ and

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.080
understanding that what we do is for his honor and for his glory.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.160
And I seek that the ministries that we have, the things that we do,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.920
that they're engaging the people of God to bring honor and glory to his name.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.480
I said that we're to edify the brethren.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.080
I said, I feel like we do a pretty good job at that.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.040
Again, not saying that in either one of those areas that we've arrived,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.960
that we have no improvement to make.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.440
But I said, I feel like we've done a pretty good job,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.440
if we honestly evaluate it.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.880
And then I said this, we're to evangelize the lost.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.360
And if you were here, you heard me say, I think we're doing miserable.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:01.980
We're failing.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.440
That was what I said to you transparently.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.760
I began to pray that God would give me an opportunity.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.320
On Monday morning, a man comes here to do something

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.679
that's never been here before.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.839
And I got to spend 20 minutes in that foyer sharing the gospel with him.

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.679
And I was just saying, thank you, Jesus, thank you.

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:27.360
Thank you for that divine appointment.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.160
So guess what I got to do?

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.479
I got to go home and I got to tell Holly and the kids how I had this opportunity.

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:35.239
And how, look, he didn't get saved, I wish he did.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.520
But when I asked him about being saved and about why Jesus died, he had no idea.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.000
We could go on and on this evening of how God's worked in our lives as individuals.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.880
But I want you to understand, for sake of time, I'm gonna keep moving on.

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:55.359
But I want you to understand that we have a responsibility

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:57.679
to influence a future generation.

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.359
And we must let them know about the wonderful works of God.

00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:05.479
And it's, yes, the biblical works, but there better be some personal things.

00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:09.840
Listen, prove God, prove God.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.720
That's what he says in the book of Malachi.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.640
He says, prove me, prove me.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.559
God's not gonna fail, he's not gonna fail.

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:24.960
There should be some things as families that we pray about, that we're proving God.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.160
And our kids get to see that God is real.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.479
They get to see the mighty hand of God.

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:37.840
Psalm 145, if you hold your place there in Psalm 78 and look over at Psalm 145,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.200
look at just a couple of verses here.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.440
In verse number four, we'll look at verse number three.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.080
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, his greatness is unsearchable.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.440
One generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.440
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.880
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.680
I will declare thy greatness.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.240
Those are some great verses of scripture

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.280
in Psalm 145, verses three through six.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280
And you see there where it says,

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.280
one generation shall praise thy works to another.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.360
And we begin to share with the future generation

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.720
the wonderful works that he hath done.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.040
Back in Psalm 78, it says in verse number six,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.800
verse number five, for he established a testimony

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.340
on Jacob, appointed a law on Israel,

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.740
which he commended our fathers,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.120
that they should make them known to their children.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.160
It's always been God's plan that his people

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.000
influence the next generation.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.400
It's been his plan, it's been the purpose.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.740
We find that as we look at the word of God

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.280
and we find that there in Psalm 145,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.960
where he talks about the works of God

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.280
and the greatness of God.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.040
Listen, we serve a great God there in Psalm 78.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.400
If you look over maybe on the same page in Psalm 77,

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.260
in verse number 14, the Bible says,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.020
thou art the God that doest wonders.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:03.020
Thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.940
Listen, our God, he doeth wondrous things.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.920
We ought to talk to our kids about when we got saved.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.500
Amen?

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.460
You know, for some of us,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.300
our kids don't know anything about Egypt.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.940
I don't mean about the country on the map.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.960
I mean about the typology in the Scriptures.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.720
There's some kids that don't know anything about Egypt.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.420
You know what happened to that generation

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.320
that rose up in the book of Deuteronomy?

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.780
They didn't know anything about Egypt,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.660
so you know what they wanted to do?

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.180
They wanted to go back to Egypt.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.820
Because they didn't know anything about it.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.660
And guess what?

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.320
Egypt has some attraction.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.420
Can we be transparent this evening?

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.460
Egypt has some attraction.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.680
You know what the Bible says in Hebrews 11?

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.980
There's pleasure in sin for a season.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.140
Right?

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.900
And there's some attraction, and guess what?

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.340
There's some young people

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.980
that they don't know anything about Egypt,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.740
and they don't hear mom and dad

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.220
talk about what God saved them from,

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.300
or what mom and dad or their parents,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.620
what grandma and grandpa got saved from,

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.820
and how God changed their life and changed the course

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.600
and the godly heritage that they have.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.740
Why?

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.580
Because we're not sharing it with them.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.779
They need to know.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.779
The kids in our church,

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:22.779
they need to know how God changed our lives,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.220
how God saved us and changed the course of our lives.

00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:33.740
We got a generation that's growing up in church,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.740
and they're leaving as soon as they graduate high school.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.279
You can look at all the statistics.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:42.540
There are books that have been written on it.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.980
I don't endorse everything.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.260
Not only, I don't endorse everything

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.300
that Ken Ham or Answers in Genesis has put out,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.180
but he's written a couple of books

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.300
on the generation that's left.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.540
Good stuff.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.059
And we can't just continue to put our head in the sand

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:05.340
and act like, well, it's gonna change.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.380
We gotta be active,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.220
because the reason that the generation is leaving

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.580
is because they're being indoctrinated.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.779
And those seeds of doubt are being sown.

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:19.779
And they're saying, I don't need this.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.700
And it's sad.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.940
As a pastor, it breaks my heart.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.720
See, I think it's the same to all 17.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.700
I remember going to Bible college,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.100
supposed to be with the cream of the crop,

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.020
so to speak, as they would say.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.180
Those that feel like, listen,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.740
I didn't go to a biblical college

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.500
that had all sorts of majors

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.980
and all sorts of arenas of life.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.100
I went to a Bible college

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.860
that you were studying for ministry.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.180
That was the only majors we had,

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.380
Bible, pastoral, theology, missions.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.980
And then there were some Christian education stuff.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.820
That was it.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.820
And I remember sitting in class

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.380
with guys that grew up in church.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.279
I had just got saved.

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.300
I started Bible college one year in the Lord.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.200
My spiritual birthday, I was one in the Lord,

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.360
and I sat in my first Bible college class.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.980
And I remember in the dorms,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.399
guys that were just over it, so to speak.

00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.559
Oh, yeah, they knew it.

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.940
But they wanted to go do something else.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.760
They wanted to go see what the world had to offer.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.700
They wanted to go drink.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.160
They wanted to go participate in immoral activity.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.119
They wanted to do all these things.

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:32.820
And I'm like, man, I was in public school my whole life.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.380
I saw that stuff.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.119
Why would you want that?

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.959
Somebody along the way didn't tell them

00:34:40.959 --> 00:34:42.360
what Egypt was all about.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.320
Notice not only the responsibility.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.600
I got just a couple of minutes.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.959
Consider the results.

00:34:51.959 --> 00:34:54.260
Look at verse number seven in Psalm 78.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.279
It says this in verse six,

00:34:57.279 --> 00:34:59.520
that the generation to come might know them.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.720
Everything that we just looked at,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.679
even the children which should be born,

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:04.559
who should arise and declare them to their children.

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:06.059
Do you see the generational impact?

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:07.540
This is God's plan.

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:11.520
It's that my parents would teach me

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.239
the truth that we find here in this passage,

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.480
and that I would teach my children,

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.800
and then my children would teach the grandchildren,

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800
and so on and so forth.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.320
That's the way God designed it to work.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.600
We find in verse number seven, it says that they,

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.520
that generation to come,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.580
that they might, number one, set their hope in God.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.559
Isn't that what we want?

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:37.220
Listen, there's no hope apart from God.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.520
We live in the midst of a society that's hopeless.

00:35:45.279 --> 00:35:47.020
It says that they might set their hope in God.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.360
By the way, you'll never be disappointed with God.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.559
I'm not saying your life will be perfect.

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.779
I'm not saying that you'll have no trials or troubles,

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.279
but isn't it good knowing when you go through

00:35:57.279 --> 00:36:00.399
the trial and trouble that God has a purpose in it?

00:36:00.399 --> 00:36:01.360
Amen?

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.619
Do you remember when you were lost,

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:03.959
and you went through trials and troubles,

00:36:03.959 --> 00:36:06.220
and you just didn't know what was going on?

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.760
You're at the end of your rope.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.440
All the stuff that was going on, but now in Christ,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.720
man, when I have a trouble, when I have a trial,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.800
it's God's in control, and God has a purpose,

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.839
and God has a plan, and he's trying to draw me to himself.

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:21.140
He's trying to teach me something.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.880
He's growing me and developing me.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.200
He's working to bring glory to himself.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.459
Man, it gives us a completely different perspective

00:36:28.459 --> 00:36:30.559
on trials and troubles.

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:32.320
God will not fail.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.059
He never has, and you will not be the first

00:36:36.059 --> 00:36:38.660
that God fails on, amen?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.760
Great is thy faithfulness, we sing the song.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.380
God is faithful.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.899
Notice this in verse seven.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.820
And not forget the works of God.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.000
You know, it's interesting when you read that phrase,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.959
the word forget can carry with it the idea

00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:00.720
of what we would use when we say forget.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.020
We've forgotten something,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.059
but it also carries with it this idea.

00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:07.020
This word in the Hebrew carries with it this idea,

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.020
a ceasing to care, ceasing to care.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.500
Now think about that just for a moment.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.500
It says that they might sit there hoping God

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.660
and not forget the works of God.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.279
Here's what I find in our own lives

00:37:24.279 --> 00:37:26.380
and in the lives of the generation to come.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.420
It's not that somebody has forgotten

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.179
that God parted the Red Sea.

00:37:30.179 --> 00:37:31.660
It's not that somebody's forgotten

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.500
that they've been bought with a price.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.700
It's not that somebody's forgotten

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.339
that Jesus is coming again.

00:37:36.339 --> 00:37:39.260
It's just that we're not mindful of it.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.700
I said that a couple of weeks ago,

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.720
and it's been so impactful in my life personally

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.540
that every day I have to be mindful of the promises of God.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.700
Listen, when the psalmist says in Psalm 119,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.899
I will not forget thy works.

00:37:52.899 --> 00:37:55.300
How do you make such a statement?

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.739
We've all forgotten something.

00:37:57.739 --> 00:37:59.459
You say, man, I forgot something today.

00:37:59.459 --> 00:38:01.700
Man, if it wasn't, Miss Jackie says,

00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:03.440
I'm losing my marbles.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.980
And listen, we have things that we do, right?

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.380
You tie a string, you do this, we got phones.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.540
Then you put a note in your phone

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.820
and you forget where you put it, right?

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.580
You put something and then you do the search feature

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.260
and the search feature doesn't work.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.100
Anyone relate?

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.920
You know what I'm saying?

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.980
And we forget things.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.420
So how can the psalmist says, I will not forget?

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.739
You gotta be actively engaged on reminding yourself.

00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:28.700
You gotta be in it.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.940
And you gotta let it get in you.

00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:32.020
Amen?

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.780
And then as you're in it and it's in you,

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.820
you're not gonna forget.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.260
You're gonna know that God's able.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.739
Listen, it's a sad thing to me

00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:40.700
when a child of God faces a crisis in their life

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.859
and they have nothing that they can hold on to.

00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:45.700
Why?

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.380
Because they've been a stranger to this book.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.739
They've been a stranger to the throne room of God.

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:52.140
They have nothing in their life

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.900
that they are actively seeing God work

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.179
and they enter into a crisis and their world falls apart.

00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:00.859
I've seen it too many times.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.000
And then you talk to the believer that's abiding in Him,

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.580
that's enjoying sweet fellowship with Him

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.940
and they have a crisis in their life

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.700
and they say, oh, I'm trusting God.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.220
Here's what He did in the life of,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.619
here's what He did in the life of,

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:20.020
here's what He's done for me before.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.960
And then they have hope,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.780
they have confidence that God's gonna work,

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.940
that God's gonna do something.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.140
Why?

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.340
Because they've seen it.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.619
They've proved God.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.220
We find that it says, keep His commandments

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.660
at the end of verse number seven,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.660
but keep His commandments.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.979
Don't we want our children,

00:39:37.979 --> 00:39:41.059
don't we want the generation to come to be obedient to God?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.059
There's a blessing in obedience.

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:49.539
Notice back in verse number six in the last statement,

00:39:49.539 --> 00:39:53.559
who should arise and declare them to their children.

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:55.299
You know, somewhere along the way,

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.260
our churches have been.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:05.220
failed as believers. Honestly, if we just be honest and evaluate, there's a generation

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:11.940
that's missing, there's a failure that we must own, and we must learn from it. And we

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:18.260
understand this evening that when we consider this generation to come, we consider the responsibility,

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:25.100
we consider the results, that we must be mindful of the fact that our God is eternal, so He

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:31.340
spans every generation. I have the ability to influence the generation that God would

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.580
give me the opportunity to influence, but there comes a point where my influence is

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.940
going to end because I'm going to go home to be with the Lord. Amen? And none of us

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:46.180
know when that's going to be, by the way. Some of you that are much older than me, I

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.380
could die before you. We can go to the cemetery and the graveyard and you can find gravestone

00:40:51.380 --> 00:41:00.540
markers with ages that span the spectrum, right? So we don't know. But the God who's

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.700
outside of time, the God who spans every generation, the eternal God, He's promised to preserve

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:13.980
His Word from generation to generation. And as we would encourage our children, as we'd

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.500
encourage them to, this generation to come, to set their hope in God, as we would give

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.460
them the, teach them about the wonderful works of God, and we teach them to keep their

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:32.340
eyes on God, they will have the truth that God spans every generation. Moses said this

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.020
in Psalm 90 and verse number 2, before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:42.380
hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:50.140
God. Let me remind you of what it says in the book of Lamentations. If you want to turn

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:59.900
there, we'll finish with this text of Scripture. Jeremiah, Lamentations. Lamentations chapter

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:07.380
number 5. I'm just going to look at one verse of Scripture and we'll close this evening.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:13.300
As we seek to influence and reach the generation to come, when we understand that we must have

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:19.820
active engagement, we must be purposed, we must be disciplined. Listen, I understand

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:26.980
that life is busy. Amen? Pierre's not in here right now, but I sent him a text yesterday

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.520
with a picture of Joseph and Zachary. Kimberly, did you see that picture? They were standing

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:39.080
right here on the platform. Joseph was like 14 inches shorter than he is right now. And

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.760
Zachary was like, he was standing as like this tall. And on that particular Sunday,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.600
they both had orange shirts on and black dress pants and a tie that was very similar. So,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.320
they got a picture right here together. If I remember correctly, it was just three years

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.760
ago. But man, when you look at that picture, you say, man, how the time flies. Listen,

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.680
if we're not purposed in this thing of influencing the next generation before we know it, the

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.740
opportunity is gone. Tony, our daughters are graduating high school this year. I remember

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.920
when they first started singing up here in children's church. I remember just like we

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.080
looked at those kids. I know I got one that's married, but Brianna's here right now. I remember

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.560
watching our kids in our church sing up here and I remember Kiademe and Brianna. I got

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:33.680
pictures. They're this tall. Little girls just like Natalie and Lydia. We know how time

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:40.560
goes and we have an opportunity. Notice what Lamentations 5 and verse 19 says about our

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.320
God. Again, the one who spans every generation, the one whose hope we're seeking to have our

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:52.120
children set their hope in this God. It says in verse number 19 of Lamentations 5, thou,

00:43:52.120 --> 00:44:03.640
O Lord, remainest forever. Thy throne from generation to generation. There's coming a

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:10.200
day, and I don't know when the day is, but if it should go according to what I would

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.520
think or what a natural process would be, that my children will no longer have me as

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:22.839
their father here personally in body. I will go home to be with the Lord. Amen? I hope

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:26.200
I go home to be with the Lord before my children. I know it doesn't always work that way. I

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.520
understand that, but that would be my desire. There's coming a day that I will not be the

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:37.160
pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church anymore. It's going to happen. As much as we want to

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:42.660
combat father time and whatever terminology we want to use, the reality is that at some

00:44:42.779 --> 00:44:53.779
point, I'm going to pass away. I'm going to be home with the Lord. But God is forever. He's

00:44:53.779 --> 00:45:01.059
eternal. As we teach these young people, this generation to come, listen, don't just look to

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:11.700
me. Look to God. God will not fail you. I may. God will never be wrong. I'm wrong. Right? We're

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:21.300
all men. We're all human beings. We've all erred. He's perfect. And when I'm in glory,

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:27.220
I hope the people that God has allowed me to influence are continuing to serve the one

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:37.300
who is eternal. The generation to come, listen, there is a battle that is raging. They're

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:52.980
no longer being discreet about it. They are putting their agenda in our face. Our warfare

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:59.940
is not carnal. It's spiritual. We serve the God Almighty who is able, and we need to be

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:08.500
actively engaged. God, how can I? God, how can you use me? Is there some small way, God,

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:19.380
that you can use me to have an influence in the future generation? God, use me so that they would

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:25.540
see that you're real, that you're still working. They would understand what you're capable of

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:30.820
doing, and that they would set their hope in you, that they would serve you, they would obey you,

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:39.700
because there's a generation to come. And for too long, there's a generation that's come and gone.

00:46:41.779 --> 00:46:47.940
I trust that God would help us tonight to recognize our responsibility, to pray for the results,

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:55.140
and to see God do what only He can do, that we would be actively engaged in reaching a generation

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:02.900
to come. Let's pray. Father, how we love you. No doubt in our own lives, there are times in which

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:10.660
we wonder how we could ever do this or that. We see a need, but we don't know what we could do

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:16.980
or how to approach it. I'm so thankful that you've given us your Word. And then in this simple

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:23.380
passage of Scripture in Psalm 78, it's so powerful because it's truth. It's your precious Word. You've

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:29.779
provided for us in these verses of Scripture a pattern to follow. I pray God that you'd help

00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:36.980
us to be actively engaged. You'd help us, Lord, to be mindful of the work that is required, the diligence.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.020
We cannot take off. We cannot be absent.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:50.580
We must be engaged. Lord, I pray that this evening you'd stir the hearts of your people.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:48:00.100
And God, we'd seek and make ourselves available that you would use us to influence a future

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:05.140
generation. Well, thank you for the work that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
