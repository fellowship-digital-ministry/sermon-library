1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
I don't know if I'd come back.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,799
I didn't do it.

3
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,799
No?

4
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,299
Good?

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,680
Got it.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,599
Because I plan on getting really loud, so I'm glad.

7
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:41,520
The music has been outstanding.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,240
And I don't know that I've ever been a church.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't ever know who's going to play the piano.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,520
There's like a revolving thing there.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
There's like seven people, I think, that play the piano.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,959
And I say this sincerely.

13
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm not doing this in jest.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,919
If I could have chosen my gift, and if I have one,

15
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:07,120
I would have chosen to be able to play the piano and sing.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,639
I think that there's a great deal of good

17
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:12,360
that can be done in that and come from that.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,040
And I don't mind preaching, but that singing's good stuff.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
Amen?

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,000
And when you've got a face like this, singing would help,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,599
I think.

22
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,160
I don't know.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,440
Take your Bible, if you would, and turn with me to chapter 16

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
of the book of Acts.

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,480
That's where we're going to start.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,639
We won't finish there.

27
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,199
We won't end up there.

28
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:35,199
But that's where we're going to start tonight.

29
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:38,080
And I want to preach on this thought tonight,

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,760
seeing missions in action.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400
Seeing missions in action.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,720
And when I say that, we're going to look at it

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,720
from the perspective of the missionary.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,599
We're going to look at it from the perspective

35
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,519
of the supporting church.

36
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,760
And we're going to look at it from the perspective

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
of the Lord himself.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,400
But let's start in Acts chapter 16.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,879
And we'll read two verses there.

40
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,080
We'll read a number more.

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,600
But let's start with verses 9 and 10.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,880
Acts 16, verses 9 and 10.

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,639
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night.

44
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,080
And there stood a man of Macedonia

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,119
and prayed him, saying, come over into Macedonia

46
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,880
and help us.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,759
And after he had seen the vision,

48
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,960
immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia,

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:40,160
assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,839
the gospel unto them.

51
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,160
Let's pray.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,600
Father, we're very grateful for this evening to be together.

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,080
Thank you so much for the blessing of the music

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,960
that we've heard tonight and been able to sing ourselves.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,199
We're thankful for these missionary families,

56
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,880
the Alvarez and the Zdarsky families.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,399
Thank you for them, for the call that you've

58
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,119
placed on their life.

59
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,199
Lord, I pray that you'd bless them and then bless us

60
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,759
with understanding tonight.

61
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,800
And help us to see how important our role is in missions

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
as well.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,119
Bless the message and bless our understanding.

64
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,679
In Jesus' name, amen.

65
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:31,119
Paul went to Philippi as the result of a missionary call.

66
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,479
I don't want to get overly wrapped up in this,

67
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,440
but I'm glad that the Bible teaches us

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,839
that God calls people.

69
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,960
And I think it's important that we understand

70
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,440
that God calls people.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,800
I think he probably calls more people than respond.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,000
But God calls us and calls all of us.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,160
Not all of us are called to a foreign field.

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,880
Not all of us are called to fill a pulpit.

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,960
But God gifts every believer.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,279
And I believe God calls every believer

77
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,119
to use the gift that he has given them

78
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,520
wherever he places them.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,880
When we come to Acts chapter 16 and we

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,679
see that vision appear to Paul, we

81
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:20,839
ask ourselves, what took place there?

82
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,359
What's going on?

83
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,760
And the truth is that in his companion

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,839
are Silas and Timothy and Dr. Luke.

85
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,760
And they are on a missionary journey.

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,519
And it was their intention to minister in Asia Minor.

87
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,679
They've come through Lystra.

88
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,480
And they've visited a couple of other cities.

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,359
And Paul's desire, Paul's thought

90
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,320
is that he wants to continue to minister

91
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,079
in the area of Bithynia.

92
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,040
You say, where's Bithynia?

93
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,760
Where is Troas?

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,359
Well, think of modern day Turkey.

95
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,320
If you have any knowledge of the geography of that area,

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,959
if you know where the Dardanelles Strait is,

97
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,799
right there is Troas.

98
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:12,239
And God has just closed door after door after door.

99
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,079
And I think with some frustration,

100
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,679
Paul says, OK, let's go down to Troas.

101
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,200
We've got friends there.

102
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,279
And they're literally being put up for the night.

103
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,119
And I don't know where Silas and Timothy and Luke are.

104
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,040
But Luke's with them.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,320
He's the one writing this.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,040
And that night, when Paul finally pillows his head

107
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,959
and finally goes to sleep, God speaks to him.

108
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,480
And God gives him a vision.

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,600
I know sometimes we talk about eating pizza and doing things

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,559
like that and getting visions.

111
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:51,160
Please understand, that's not what's happening here.

112
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,239
God is speaking to Paul.

113
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:58,480
And as I alluded to in the Sunday school hour

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,839
yesterday morning, this is an important moment.

115
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,760
Because literally, God is calling

116
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,440
Paul and his missionary party not just to another city,

117
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,279
but from Asia to the continent of Europe.

118
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,559
And when Paul sees this vision and he

119
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:23,239
sees this Macedonian man, understand

120
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:26,839
that Macedonia is in present day Greece.

121
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,600
And he wakes up from that vision.

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,839
And boy, he stirs the party.

123
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,959
Timothy, Silas, Luke, we've got to go.

124
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,239
I know where God wants us to go.

125
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:40,359
And they book fare on a ship.

126
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:44,440
And the Bible tells us that they leave from Troas,

127
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,399
the port.

128
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,399
They sail to an island not too far off the coast, Samothracea.

129
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,559
When they leave Samothracea, and again,

130
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,799
remember, they drop off cargo and they pick up cargo.

131
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,640
Where they're actually trying to get

132
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,600
is to a small port called Neapolis on the Greek coast.

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,359
And when they land in Neapolis, Paul

134
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:13,160
makes a beeline for a little town called Philippi.

135
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,799
Now, who in the world cares about Philippi?

136
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:21,079
Now, I consider myself an amateur historian.

137
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,079
So in just about every sermon, you're

138
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,200
going to get a history lesson.

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,720
And I don't want to see any frowns about it, all right?

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,079
Sometimes we don't know the background of things

141
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,519
and we miss some of the important little things that

142
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,799
are said.

143
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,320
I want you to understand that Philippi

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,720
is a very important city from this standpoint.

145
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,079
About 100 years before Paul shows up at Philippi,

146
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,079
there was a major battle that took place right outside

147
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,760
its gates.

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,359
Two men, men named Brutus and Cassius,

149
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:06,959
you may remember who Brutus is, et tu Brute?

150
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,679
Brutus and Cassius were two of those

151
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:14,399
that murdered Julius Caesar, surprised him with the knives

152
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,480
and hundreds of knife thrusts into his body.

153
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,200
And they killed Julius Caesar, intending

154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,399
to seize the Roman Empire.

155
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,679
There were two other important men, one of them Mark Anthony.

156
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,160
And he now has left Egypt.

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,000
And he has sided with Octavian, who is a great Roman general.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,960
And those two armies, the armies of Brutus and Cassius,

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,960
meet the army of Mark Anthony and Octavius

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,080
right outside of the city of Philippi.

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,359
The citizens of Philippi decide that they're

162
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:57,159
going to aid and help Octavius and Mark Anthony.

163
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,719
And those two win the battle.

164
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,599
You say, this is fascinating stuff, preacher.

165
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,719
Now, wait a minute.

166
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,840
Here's what becomes important.

167
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,440
Octavius became Caesar.

168
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,679
And he so appreciated what the Philippians did,

169
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,440
what that city of Philippi did, that he conferred on them

170
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,679
every citizen of Philippi.

171
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,479
From that point on, their children

172
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,559
were born Roman citizens.

173
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,119
Philippi actually becomes a Roman colony

174
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,520
and a Roman capital in that area.

175
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,280
And those who would have never had any hope of Roman

176
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,799
citizenship are now made Roman citizens.

177
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,840
You say, why is that important?

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,760
Well, it's important for a number of reasons.

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Look at verse 12.

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
And from thence to Philippi, which

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,119
is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,

182
00:09:56,119 --> 00:10:01,280
and a colony, it's a chief city.

183
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,280
city, not because of its location, but because Octavius

184
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,280
made it a colony and gave them citizenship. Look at verse

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,280
21, and teach customs, talking about Paul's

186
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,280
preaching. Hey, he's teaching customs which are not

187
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,280
lawful for us to receive, neither to observe

188
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,280
being Romans. You say, what's the

189
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
importance here, preacher? They consider themselves Romans.

190
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
And one of the things that it was very important

191
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
to do as a Roman citizen was to worship

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Caesar. Now they had hundreds of gods, maybe thousands.

193
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,280
But every year, you were to at least make

194
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,280
one small offering to Caesar. And they wanted

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
to protect being a Roman colony, and they wanted to

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,280
protect being Roman citizens, so when anybody

197
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,280
showed up and started saying there was another king,

198
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,280
and there was a real, true God, and he

199
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,280
started preaching the gospel, brother, opposition was going

200
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,280
to be raised. Remember that. Remember that as we go

201
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,280
on in this. Well, when the Apostle Paul and Silas and Timothy

202
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,280
and Luke arrive at Philippi, there's no synagogue.

203
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Paul usually started preaching

204
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,280
in a synagogue. But a city had to have a certain number of

205
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Jewish men to have a synagogue, and there were no

206
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Jewish men, or not many Jewish men that were permanent residents

207
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,280
of Philippi. And so what you did, if you were

208
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,280
a Hebrew, if you were a Jew, you were instructed that if there

209
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,280
was no synagogue, if you were in a city, that on the Sabbath day

210
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,280
you were to find a quiet spot by the river, if there was a

211
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,280
river or a park, some quiet spot where you worship

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,280
the Lord. Now isn't that interesting that Paul and his

213
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,280
missionary party went to the riverside? They didn't just go to the riverside

214
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
because there was a park there. They went to the riverside because they

215
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,280
knew there would be people who were pious at that riverside.

216
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,280
And when they arrive at that riverside, they

217
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
begin to preach the gospel. They begin to engage

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,280
with people, and one of the first ones that hear their preaching

219
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,280
is a woman named Lydia. And the Bible tells us that

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Lydia, when she heard the preaching of the Word of God,

221
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,280
accepted Christ as her Savior. And her family

222
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,280
accepted Christ as her Savior. And so grateful was

223
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
she that she actually came to the Apostle Paul and said,

224
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
listen, I've got a place that we can meet. I've got a place

225
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,280
where we can teach. Please come to my home

226
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,280
and begin, I don't know that she would have understood it as a

227
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,280
church, but she wanted her home to be used as a

228
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,280
place where he could teach the Word of God.

229
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Now, understand this. Whenever you

230
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,280
have the gospel being preached, Satan

231
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,280
hates it. And you can guarantee that

232
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,280
his opposition is going to grow. Notice verse 16,

233
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer,

234
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,280
a certain damsel, possessed with a spirit of divination,

235
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,280
met us, which brought her masters much gain by

236
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,280
soothsaying. The same followed Paul and us,

237
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,280
that's Luke writing, and cried, saying, These men are

238
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,280
the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us

239
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,280
the way of salvation. And this did she many days.

240
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,280
But Paul, being grieved, turned and said

241
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,280
to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ

242
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,280
to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

243
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Now, you say, preacher, why did Paul do that?

244
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,280
She was agreeing. She was saying, hey, these men

245
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,280
preach the true God. These men are preaching real salvation.

246
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Well, please understand that one of Satan's great

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,280
tactics is to appear to be what we are.

248
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,280
All through my ministry, I would have

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
people, preachers and other people, come and say, they would begin

250
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,280
something like this, now preacher, we're just like you.

251
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,280
And when you've got to tell me you're just like me,

252
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,280
you're probably not just like me, alright?

253
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,280
What this young lady was doing was subtly

254
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,280
building herself up as,

255
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,280
listen, these guys are here with my invitation.

256
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,280
These guys are here with my approval.

257
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,280
These guys are just like me. And the apostle Paul

258
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,280
knows that this is a demonic-filled young lady.

259
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,280
He knows that this is not the true gospel.

260
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,280
And he tries to be kind

261
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,280
and finally he understands, no, this is demon activity

262
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,280
and this young lady needs freed and this needs to be

263
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,280
stopped. And he casts that demon out of

264
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,280
that young lady by the power of God.

265
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Now again, notice in verse 19.

266
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,280
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,

267
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,280
they caught Paul and Silas, drew them into the

268
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,280
marketplace under the rulers, brought them to the magistrates

269
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,280
saying, these men being Jews,

270
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,280
you wonder why there wasn't a synagogue there? These men being

271
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Jews do exceedingly trouble our city.

272
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,280
They teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither

273
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
to observe, being Romans. And the multitudes rose up

274
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,280
together against them. And the magistrates rent off their

275
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,280
clothes and commanded to beat them. Now for the sake of time

276
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm not going to read all the rest of the verses. You're very familiar with them.

277
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,280
They are unfairly arrested, unjustly arrested.

278
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,280
They are handed to the jailer who

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,280
proceeds to beat them. And I mean when you

280
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,280
received a beating in those days, it was a beating. He takes them

281
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,280
after beating them mercilessly, not caring about their condition.

282
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Takes them to the lowest part of his dungeon.

283
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Puts them in the stocks. Doesn't try to treat the

284
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,280
stripes on their back. And there in the bottom of his

285
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,280
jail comes midnight. And folks,

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,280
we can't pretty this up. They're in agony. They're in agony.

287
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,280
I've got a little hangnail and if

288
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm a preacher, I'm outwept today for the pain

289
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,280
in my finger. I had to actually put peroxide on it.

290
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Do you feel sorry for me? No,

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm not trying to be silly, but I'm just trying to tell you these men are in agony.

292
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,280
And you know what they do at midnight?

293
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,280
They don't curse the jailer.

294
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,280
They don't shout to God how unfair they're being treated.

295
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
They don't sing praises.

296
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
And you remember what God did, don't you? You're in the bottom of the dungeon

297
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
and that's when God chooses to send an earthquake.

298
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I don't want an earthquake when I'm in the dungeon.

299
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,280
But God sends an earthquake. They are set free. The other prisoners

300
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,280
are set free. And Paul encourages all to stay there.

301
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,280
The jailer, you know what happens. He calls down

302
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
and he comes up with, what must I do to be saved? And Paul tells him

303
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
and he gets saved and all his family gets saved.

304
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,280
And you know what we just saw? A very successful missions trip.

305
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Lydia is saved. Her family is saved.

306
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I like to believe this little girl got saved. She was so happy to be

307
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
free of that demon. I think she left the soothsayers and went over to Lydia's house.

308
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,280
The jailer is saved and his family is saved.

309
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,280
And Paul and Timothy and Titus and Luke are teaching this little church.

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
And when they showed up, it was a demon

311
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
filled Roman colony. And when they left, there was a

312
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,280
church there. That's missions.

313
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Now, what I want to do is I want you to turn with me over to

314
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Philippians chapter 4 and understand that as we

315
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,280
turn our pages to Philippians chapter 4

316
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
10 years have passed. And now the Apostle

317
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Paul is not in Philippi. He's sitting in the city

318
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,280
of Ephesus. And from the city of Ephesus

319
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
he wants to write back to that group of

320
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
people, that church which no doubt has grown and their

321
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
influence has grown and their ministry has grown. And Paul

322
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,280
thinks of them often and is thankful for every time

323
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,280
he thinks of them and is grateful for the part that they now play

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,280
in his life. And he's writing this letter from Ephesus back

325
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,280
to this church at Philippi that was started in

326
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,280
such a difficult season. Notice it with

327
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
me starting in verse 10, chapter 4 verse 10.

328
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly

329
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again

330
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,280
wherein you were all so careful but you lacked

331
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of want for I have

332
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,280
learned. In whatsoever state I am therewith

333
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,480
with to be content. I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere. And in all

334
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:15,080
things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can

335
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,200
do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." Boy, don't ever take that verse lightly.

336
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,720
You know what that means? That means when your back is bleeding and hurting, you can sing praises.

337
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,160
That means when you're taken outside the city of Lystra and stoned and left for dead, you can get

338
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,800
up, shake off the dust and not be done with preaching, be committed to preaching. It means

339
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,200
you can go into Jerusalem and be smitten by the high priest and hated by them and sent to Rome,

340
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,200
and there put in prison, and then put in that filthy mammertine, the rat's nest, and know that

341
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,600
the Colosseum is next to you and you hear the screams of the crowd as the Christians are martyred

342
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,000
in front of them. Up above you is the Roman circus and you know that in that place they're putting

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,560
the Christians on the track and running over them with chariots and with horses, and then you can

344
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:23,160
say, I'm ready to be offered. Take me to the Colosseum. Take me to the circus because I can

345
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:31,720
do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Sometimes we cheapen that verse. It is not a

346
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:41,120
cheap verse. Not when you understand the man who uttered it. He says, notwithstanding ye have well

347
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,360
done that ye did communicate with my affliction. Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning

348
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,880
of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving

349
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:02,200
and receiving, but ye only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity, not

350
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:12,360
because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. But I have all and

351
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,480
abound. I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a

352
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:30,600
sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. Oh, but my God shall supply all your need

353
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:43,840
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. What a holy passage. Let me very quickly show you

354
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,240
missions from the perspective of the missionary, missions from the perspective of the church,

355
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,840
and missions from the perspective of the Lord. The role of the missionary in missions. I want

356
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:05,360
you to notice that ultimately the responsibility of a missionary is to know that the Lord is the

357
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,760
source of everything he needs. There's an important statement that's made in verse 11. Would you see

358
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:21,560
it? He says, for I have learned. The life of a missionary, if you study the Apostle Paul's life

359
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:31,120
and others, is not an easy one. It's an exciting life, it's a rewarding life, but it is not an easy

360
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,640
life. Consider modern-day missionaries, the challenges they face. Most missionaries, I see

361
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,600
the Alvarez's and they travel with two beautiful little girls. And those little girls are on duty

362
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,720
probably five nights a week in a church. And they better not run the aisle, and they better be

363
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,680
perfect in their behavior because the preacher and the deacons are watching. Pastor, that little girl

364
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:07,720
cried. I don't think they'll make it on the field. I'm telling you, it's not easy to pack your family

365
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:17,320
up and travel for two years, thousands upon thousands of miles, staying in places you don't

366
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,800
know where you're going to stay, you don't know who you're going to be staying with. Your children

367
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:29,240
are children, and you're human beings too. I guess there's an exciting side to it, but quite

368
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,120
frankly I'm glad for them to do it and not me. You're moving to a foreign country. You say, well

369
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:43,800
that's exciting. Yeah, you're not vacationing in a foreign country, you're moving to a foreign

370
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:50,280
country. You're going to learn everything new. You're going to learn a new language. Honestly,

371
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:59,000
I am not trying to be humorous here. That's beyond me. I don't have enough think power to remember

372
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,280
English, much less to learn a new language. And listen, not just learn a new language,

373
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:14,600
communicate eternal truth to a soul in that language. Come on, it's not just I want those

374
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:24,440
roles. It's without Christ you're going to hell, and it's an eternal difference in a person's life.

375
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:32,600
It is no light thing. They learn that language. They learn a new culture. They're dependent on

376
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,240
exchange rates, churches dropping them. They answer to a hundred bosses with a hundred different

377
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,040
perspectives. You say, what do you mean preacher? They got a hundred supporting pastors, and we're

378
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,760
Baptists, and every one of those Baptist pastors sees something a little bit different than the

379
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,960
other Baptist pastor, and they answer to all of them. You say, are you feeling sorry for missionaries?

380
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,600
No, I don't feel sorry for them. I'm just trying to be realistic that when we talk about missionaries,

381
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:12,040
it's not an easy thing to do. Through all that Paul says, I've learned. He learned to be content

382
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,480
even when circumstances were difficult, even when churches disappointed him, even when nationals

383
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,120
tried to kill him, because the ultimate source of his supply and the ultimate source of the help for

384
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,320
his life was not another missionary, not another person, not just a local church. It was God.

385
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:43,480
God had called them, and that's why Paul says, I can do all things through my supporting churches.

386
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:52,840
No, I can do all things through the team I work with here on the field. No, men will fail you,

387
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:02,120
but I can do what God has called me to do through Jesus Christ. Man, that's what Paul says. I've

388
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:09,560
learned that. I've learned that your dependency missionary better be on the Lord. But now,

389
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:17,960
wait a minute. Then he says this in verse 14, notwithstanding. Hey, I've learned how to be

390
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,800
content. I've learned how to trust only the Lord, but now look what he says. Notwithstanding,

391
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:34,760
ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. Hey, God uses churches to do

392
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:44,120
his providing work. And Paul is expressing gratitude for the care of the church at Philippi.

393
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,920
What a wonderful partnership when God uses a church to be a blessing to a missionary. Notice

394
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:59,000
with me how the church has a role in these missions outreaches. Number one, this great

395
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,280
church at Philippi understood they had a debt they owed. Notice with me in verse 15. Now,

396
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:17,240
ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, what is Paul referring to there?

397
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,440
Is Paul taking them back to the birth of Christ at Bethlehem? No. Is Paul taking them back to the

398
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,600
cross at Calvary? No. You know what Paul is taking them back to? Paul is saying now in the beginning

399
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,000
of the gospel, hey, church at Philippi, do you remember when I showed up at that riverside

400
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,400
and you had never heard of Jesus? And you didn't know there was a heaven?

401
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:50,040
And you didn't know there was a resurrection? And you didn't know there was one true God?

402
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,680
Remember in the beginning of the gospel when we stood at that riverside and told you the truth,

403
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,560
and Lydia, you got saved and your household got saved? Hey, jailer. Hey, tough guy. Hey, listen,

404
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,720
do you remember when you were ready to put a sword in your own stomach because you thought

405
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,400
the prisoners were gone? You remember we told you about Christ?

406
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Can I share this with you tonight?

407
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:30,840
One of the essential things for every one of our lives is this. Remember where God got you.

408
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:40,040
I've been preaching for 47 years. I am a good man. No, I'm not.

409
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:50,760
No, I'm not. I'm a sinner saved by grace. And sometimes we've been around church so long that

410
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,200
we kind of think of ourselves as maybe a little better than them out there. But for the grace of

411
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,440
God, we are out.

412
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,960
there, and when God found me and got me, God didn't reach up to a high shelf and

413
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,760
find Mike Edwards. Hey, there's a worthy find. God found me in a miry pit where He

414
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,600
found you, and He drug us out of that miry pit, and cleaned us up, and saved us,

415
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:30,200
and we are tonight what we are by the grace of God. Get over yourself. We are

416
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:38,600
sinners, saved by God's grace, and what Paul is saying is, listen, do you remember

417
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,880
what you were? Do you remember where you were when God found you? And listen, that

418
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:54,160
is motivation to say this, if God can save me, God can save them. God can save

419
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,880
that guy with 15 holes in his ear and a big widening. God can save that guy who

420
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,760
puts a needle in his arm. God can save that guy who's left his family

421
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,760
and deserted his children. I'm just telling you, God can save them, and God

422
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,000
help us to get over our sanctified selves. And remember that we've got a

423
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,680
debt, a debt that we owe, and they had a plan to pay that debt. Look in verse 14

424
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,240
again. You have well done that you did communicate with me. I love that word

425
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,760
communicate. In the Greek it's the word koinonia. We hear that word often. It just

426
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,360
simply means to share. It means they took what they had, and they shared it with

427
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,520
others. And what a wonderful picture of how the physical can be used to

428
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:57,840
accomplish the spiritual. These people gave. Now understand this, right now in

429
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Macedonia things are not going well. The economy is not good, if you will. These

430
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,119
folks are suffering much affliction, yet even in the midst of that affliction, you

431
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,279
know what they said? We've got to send to Paul, because there are people that need

432
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,160
to hear the gospel, and we need to help him reach those people. And in the

433
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,119
midst of their affliction, they gave of themselves, and they gave what they had,

434
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:36,080
because they knew they owed a debt. Quickly, I want you to notice how the

435
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:45,160
Lord viewed that. Look again at verse 17. Not because I desire a gift. Can I dispel

436
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,199
a notion if it's in this room? You know one of the hardest things for Gary

437
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:58,839
Sadarsky to do? Come to a church and ask for support. Anybody want that job?

438
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,520
Anybody want that job where you go from church to church to church, because God

439
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,639
has laid a call and a burden on your life, and you go and you say to the

440
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:12,360
pastor, you try to get a meeting at the church, and you say to the church, will

441
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,279
you please help us? And you always say, will you pray for us? Because that is

442
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:23,720
valid, but you also know that you need dollars to get to that place. I don't

443
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,600
want that job. And yet that's the calling on their life. And Paul says, man, I'm not

444
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,360
coming to you by letter or person, because I desire a gift. I'm not a

445
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,600
moochinary. I'm not trying to enrich myself on going to the field. By the way,

446
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,360
I have never met a rich missionary. I've met missionaries who are barely getting

447
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,680
by. I've met missionaries who are begging God to provide the need. I've never met a

448
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,960
rich one, and Paul says, I'm not coming because I desire your money,

449
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:10,760
a desire, a gift. I need it, but I'm not trying to enrich myself. I'm coming

450
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,679
because I want me and you to bear fruit. Look what he says. Not because I desire a

451
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:28,080
gift, verse 17, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. I absolutely

452
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,119
love that verse, preacher. I don't want to dramatize this too much. I don't want

453
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,640
to go overboard, but I'm telling you, heaven is going to be an incredible

454
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:47,519
place. And there from every tribe and every tongue and every color of people,

455
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:54,080
every race, we are going to stand around the throne of God and kind of compete

456
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,720
with each other to see who can throw their crown quickest to the Lord, who is

457
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,839
deserving. And we are going to sing praises to Him. I think there'll be one

458
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:11,559
language in heaven. But I'm fully expecting someday for somebody to come

459
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,399
up to me and say, now I know we've got perfect knowledge, but this is my

460
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:21,519
illustration, so stay out of it. Somebody coming up to me and say, I want you to

461
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:29,480
know, I appreciate the gift that you made that allowed the Sadarskis to come

462
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:36,119
to Poland, that allowed Brother and Mrs. Alvarez to come to Mexico, Monterey, a

463
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,360
difficult place. Because when Brother Alvarez preached, when Mrs. Alvarez taught

464
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:51,279
that Sunday school lesson, I was a little girl and I got saved. You think sacrifice

465
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:57,720
will be worth it that day? Fruit that abounds. Listen, he goes on and he says

466
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,640
this, but I have all and abound. I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the

467
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,559
things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,

468
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:16,119
well-pleasing to God. Hey, listen, they were not a rich church. And there were

469
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,160
times of affliction, but they dug into their pockets because they knew they had

470
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,959
a debt that there were others who needed Christ like they needed Christ, had

471
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:32,160
needed Him, and now had Him. And so they gave, and Paul says, let me tell you

472
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,399
how the Lord views that gift. And again, you forgive me for being a little

473
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:43,480
dramatic. On Sundays we pass the offering plate, or at least give you the

474
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,720
opportunity to put something in the offering plate. Somewhere, sometime, some

475
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,160
Sunday, you've had a little struggle because you wanted to give something to

476
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,720
missions, but you also knew that you could have allocated that money this way.

477
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,080
You could have prioritized that money this way, but it's just on your heart to

478
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:12,160
give to the missions program at church. And maybe with a little shaking hand, you

479
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,320
put that out, and it drops in the plate, and you know that you can't do the other

480
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,000
thing you wanted to do, but you just made a sacrifice and gave it to the Lord.

481
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,200
And beyond our vision, beyond our understanding, I think something is true.

482
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:39,760
That from that little offering plate and from your pew, something rises. You say,

483
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:48,839
what is it? It's an odor. An odor of what? An odor that is pleasing to God. An odor

484
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:56,119
that sees you saying, I can do without that. I'd rather meet this need. I'd

485
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,160
rather this missionary have his need met. And as that ascends to the Lord, it is

486
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,200
pleasing to the Lord. I don't smell it. I don't see it. I understand it.

487
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,839
Thanksgiving time, it's a big season at our house, and Christmas. It's actually

488
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,480
Christmas when my wife does this. She makes cinnamon rolls, homemade cinnamon

489
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:29,320
rolls. You ever had one? You ever had 30? She makes those cinnamon rolls, and

490
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,880
usually I'm in another room in the house, and she bakes for like seven days in a

491
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,000
row. I think it's a religious experience, but she bakes and bakes and bakes. And

492
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,799
when that oven door first opens up, you know what happens. Those cinnamon rolls

493
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:52,960
and that odor fills the house. And I'm back in the other room, and I go, that's

494
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,239
pleasing to me. That's an acceptable offering to me. I don't mean to be silly,

495
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:09,840
but that's the Lord. The Lord loves our willingness to sacrifice. And by the way,

496
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,919
when the Lord smells that, you say, well, I'll have to do without. Yeah, maybe. God

497
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:22,440
will give you grace if you do. But can I remind you of the next verse? But my God

498
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:32,200
shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. We

499
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,119
read that verse, and we use that verse. Oh, it's on a lot of plaques, and

500
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,359
on a lot of cross-stitch, and so on. And it is, in general, true about giving.

501
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:48,239
But I want you to understand this, that that verse is actually in context of

502
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:55,960
missions giving. The actual context is Paul saying back to these poor Philippians,

503
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,599
you have done well. You have shared.

504
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,959
even when you were short, even when you had needs,

505
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:10,079
but you remembered the change in your life from the gospel,

506
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,839
and you understood that others needed that,

507
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,319
and you took from the little you had,

508
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:18,399
and you said, I can do this later, I'll put this off.

509
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,959
The real priority are the souls of men,

510
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:25,759
and Paul reached souls, and oh goodness,

511
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:29,079
the ones he reaches will abound to our account,

512
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,079
and God is pleased, that's missions, that's missions.

513
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:38,079
You wonder why we have revival in our churches

514
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,759
when we have missions conferences?

515
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:44,759
Because we finally put ourselves aside and think of others.

516
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,199
That's what missions does.

517
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:54,159
I close with this, 1956, four young men,

518
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,039
four young men, actually five, a fifth will join them,

519
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:03,839
moved their families to Ecuador, to Quito, Ecuador.

520
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,859
One of those men was named Jim Elliott,

521
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,079
and he so wanted to reach one particular tribe, the Aucas.

522
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:17,839
They had had some success in reaching other tribes,

523
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,239
but the Auca Indians in Ecuador were a serious business.

524
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,239
They were killers.

525
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,359
They had killed a number of workers on oil plantations.

526
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,119
They had killed others who had tried to come into their camp

527
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,359
and talk with them and civilize them, if you will.

528
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,019
But Jim Elliott and others had a real desire to reach them.

529
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,319
They came up with a plan.

530
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,199
Nate Saint was a pilot, he had a little plane,

531
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,239
and he would fly over and drop gifts,

532
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,719
and then they figured out a way to drop a bucket down,

533
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,879
and they would put gifts in.

534
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,519
And one day, after a couple of weeks of this,

535
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:57,639
the Aucas actually sent a gift back up.

536
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,119
And they thought, this is it, we can reach them,

537
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,759
they're open to us now.

538
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:05,399
And Nate Saint found a little place,

539
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,919
a little strip to land on right by the river,

540
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,759
and Jim Elliott went in, he dropped Jim off,

541
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:14,439
and then three more trips to take the other three in.

542
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:18,159
And they at first seemed to be making headway

543
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,679
with the Auca Indians.

544
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,719
But all of it was a ruse.

545
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,839
Not long after that first day,

546
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:30,159
two Auca women came out of the jungle

547
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,599
on the other side of the river.

548
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,359
And they seemed to be coming in peace

549
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,879
and seemed to be offering to talk.

550
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:42,399
And Elliott and another man got into the river

551
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:44,319
and started a cross to them.

552
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,999
And as they were doing that,

553
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,999
they heard a rustling behind them,

554
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:52,999
and Auca men had jumped out of the woods

555
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:56,159
with spears and bows and arrows,

556
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,599
and were coming quickly,

557
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,679
and there was no doubt what was in their mind,

558
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,559
they were going to kill Jim Elliott, Nate Saint,

559
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,399
and the others who were in the river.

560
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,399
Now here's the unbelievable thing.

561
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:13,799
Jim Elliott had a pistol in his coat.

562
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,759
He reached in to draw the pistol,

563
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,279
and someone else looked at him and he looked at them

564
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,919
because they had made a pact

565
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,919
that the only thing they would use the pistol for

566
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:29,159
was protection from animals.

567
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,519
They would not kill an Auca Indian

568
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,679
because they knew that soul was lost.

569
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,199
Jim Elliott, Nate Saint, and three others

570
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,299
were killed in that river that day.

571
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,839
When they could have protected themselves.

572
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,279
He wrote this, and to me it's incredible.

573
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,919
Jim Elliott wrote, he is no fool

574
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,359
who gives what he cannot keep

575
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,839
to gain what he cannot lose.

576
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,839
Sometimes we are so careful

577
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,319
about holding on to everything we have here.

578
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,839
To making sure that we're cared for here,

579
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,799
and I'm a planner, I'm not for just being foolish.

580
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:26,359
But I am saying this to you,

581
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:28,759
that we owe a debt.

582
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:35,279
And missions is the way that we can pay that debt.

583
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,499
And God calls missionaries to go into places

584
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:43,059
to do things that I don't want to do.

585
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,319
But they're not the only ones who have to live by faith.

586
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,199
We are called to live by faith.

587
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,439
And we are called to be the rope holders.

588
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:56,639
We are called to be the ones who give

589
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,279
so that they can go.

590
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:03,159
And I'm telling you, it takes them to sacrifice home

591
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,119
and sacrifice a lot of things with family,

592
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,679
sacrifice career.

593
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,959
But listen, we are called upon to sacrifice.

594
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,119
We are called to prioritize.

595
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:16,919
We are called to set one thing above another.

596
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:21,839
We are called to do without sometimes.

597
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,399
Boy, not a message our generation wants to hear.

598
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:31,039
But when God sees us say,

599
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,419
there's something more important than filling my need,

600
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,239
something more important than satisfying my want,

601
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:46,259
I want to share what I have so that they can go,

602
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,999
so that they can preach, so that others can hear.

603
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:55,519
And when we make that choice, God goes,

604
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,579
that's pleasing, that's acceptable.

605
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:05,239
You ever heard this?

606
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:06,759
You cannot out give God.

607
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,099
Well, the proof of it is there in verse 19.

608
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,219
God says, when you've got that kind of heart,

609
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:16,379
here's what I do for you, I'll supply all your need.

610
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:19,779
Big circle.

611
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:23,539
With this, I close.

612
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:27,439
You know, I have never seen a U-Haul at a funeral.

613
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:30,819
You ever seen it?

614
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:33,299
I've never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul

615
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:36,699
because you don't take it with you

616
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:39,099
and because there is something beyond this life.

617
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,499
And what Jim Elliott said was, reprioritize.

618
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:48,499
Really look out there at what really is important.

619
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:53,099
Remember where God got you and how God changed your life

620
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:58,619
and find some portion of your heart that can give.

621
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,099
That can give.

622
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,519
God may be calling you to give your life.

623
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,479
He may want you to go.

624
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:08,099
Next time I preach, I want to preach about that.

625
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,699
But God is definitely calling us, church,

626
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:16,199
to set right priorities.

627
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:22,459
And souls are the highest priority that God has.

628
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,499
Would you pray with me?

629
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:27,139
Father, help us to see truth.

630
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,479
I pray that you would speak to our hearts

631
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:33,199
about the priorities in our lives.

632
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,139
I don't think you want anybody to be foolish.

633
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:39,639
I don't think you want missionaries to be foolish.

634
00:47:41,899 --> 00:47:46,219
But I do think you want us to be sacrificial.

635
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,379
I do think you want us to care about souls.

636
00:47:50,379 --> 00:47:53,159
I do think you want us to remember where we were

637
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:55,439
when you found us.

638
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,299
I do think you want us to consider

639
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,839
how you've made our lives better,

640
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,339
how you've promised us beyond this life, eternal life.

641
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:06,619
I do think you want us to remember

642
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:08,579
that just as much as you loved us,

643
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,159
you love every person in this world.

644
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,419
I do think you want us to remember

645
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:16,379
that you want us to bear fruit.

646
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,339
God, would you help us to prioritize?

647
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:27,299
Would you help us to struggle with that in our lives?

648
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,179
What could we set aside?

649
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,479
What could we do without?

650
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:37,000
What could we change?

651
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,559
What desire could we put away?

652
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,559
What habit could we undo

653
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:50,239
that would allow us to give so that others can hear,

654
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,579
so that others can go?

655
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,000
Lord, I pray that you would lay on our hearts tonight

656
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,719
that it's not just the missionaries who should pay a price,

657
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:04,959
but we ought to be willing to sacrifice too.

658
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,039
So in whatever way you desire,

659
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:11,639
I pray you'd speak into the lives of people.

660
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,639
Maybe they just need to struggle with their priorities.

661
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,479
Maybe they need to make a commitment

662
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:22,359
that they're going to give more so that more can hear.

663
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,679
Maybe there's one here tonight that you've been really,

664
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:28,679
you've been dealing with them in their heart

665
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,880
and they know that you're dealing with them.

666
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,919
Lord, may they just invite you in.

667
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:40,719
And if it's a call to the field, then may they surrender.

668
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,279
If it's a call to prioritize, may they make that choice.

669
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,839
Lord, I pray you'd help us to see our need.

670
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,919
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

671
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,079
I'm gonna ask you to...
