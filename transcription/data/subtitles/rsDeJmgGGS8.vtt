WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
I don't know if I'd come back.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.799
I didn't do it.

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:32.799
No?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:33.299
Good?

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.680
Got it.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.599
Because I plan on getting really loud, so I'm glad.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.520
The music has been outstanding.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240
And I don't know that I've ever been a church.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.000
I don't ever know who's going to play the piano.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.520
There's like a revolving thing there.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.520
There's like seven people, I think, that play the piano.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.959
And I say this sincerely.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.360
I'm not doing this in jest.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.919
If I could have chosen my gift, and if I have one,

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:07.120
I would have chosen to be able to play the piano and sing.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.639
I think that there's a great deal of good

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.360
that can be done in that and come from that.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
And I don't mind preaching, but that singing's good stuff.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.080
Amen?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.000
And when you've got a face like this, singing would help,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.599
I think.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.160
I don't know.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.440
Take your Bible, if you would, and turn with me to chapter 16

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.080
of the book of Acts.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.480
That's where we're going to start.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.639
We won't finish there.

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.199
We won't end up there.

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:35.199
But that's where we're going to start tonight.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.080
And I want to preach on this thought tonight,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.760
seeing missions in action.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.400
Seeing missions in action.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.720
And when I say that, we're going to look at it

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
from the perspective of the missionary.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.599
We're going to look at it from the perspective

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.519
of the supporting church.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.760
And we're going to look at it from the perspective

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.040
of the Lord himself.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400
But let's start in Acts chapter 16.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.879
And we'll read two verses there.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.080
We'll read a number more.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.600
But let's start with verses 9 and 10.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.880
Acts 16, verses 9 and 10.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.639
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.080
And there stood a man of Macedonia

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.119
and prayed him, saying, come over into Macedonia

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.880
and help us.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.759
And after he had seen the vision,

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.960
immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.160
assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.839
the gospel unto them.

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.160
Let's pray.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.600
Father, we're very grateful for this evening to be together.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.080
Thank you so much for the blessing of the music

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.960
that we've heard tonight and been able to sing ourselves.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.199
We're thankful for these missionary families,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.880
the Alvarez and the Zdarsky families.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.399
Thank you for them, for the call that you've

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.119
placed on their life.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.199
Lord, I pray that you'd bless them and then bless us

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.759
with understanding tonight.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:16.800
And help us to see how important our role is in missions

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.240
as well.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.119
Bless the message and bless our understanding.

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.679
In Jesus' name, amen.

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:31.119
Paul went to Philippi as the result of a missionary call.

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.479
I don't want to get overly wrapped up in this,

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.440
but I'm glad that the Bible teaches us

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.839
that God calls people.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.960
And I think it's important that we understand

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.440
that God calls people.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.800
I think he probably calls more people than respond.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.000
But God calls us and calls all of us.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.160
Not all of us are called to a foreign field.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.880
Not all of us are called to fill a pulpit.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.960
But God gifts every believer.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.279
And I believe God calls every believer

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.119
to use the gift that he has given them

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.520
wherever he places them.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.880
When we come to Acts chapter 16 and we

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.679
see that vision appear to Paul, we

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:20.839
ask ourselves, what took place there?

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.359
What's going on?

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.760
And the truth is that in his companion

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.839
are Silas and Timothy and Dr. Luke.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.760
And they are on a missionary journey.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.519
And it was their intention to minister in Asia Minor.

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.679
They've come through Lystra.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:43.480
And they've visited a couple of other cities.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.359
And Paul's desire, Paul's thought

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:49.320
is that he wants to continue to minister

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.079
in the area of Bithynia.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.040
You say, where's Bithynia?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.760
Where is Troas?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.359
Well, think of modern day Turkey.

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:01.320
If you have any knowledge of the geography of that area,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.959
if you know where the Dardanelles Strait is,

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.799
right there is Troas.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:12.239
And God has just closed door after door after door.

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:14.079
And I think with some frustration,

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.679
Paul says, OK, let's go down to Troas.

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:19.200
We've got friends there.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.279
And they're literally being put up for the night.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.119
And I don't know where Silas and Timothy and Luke are.

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:26.040
But Luke's with them.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.320
He's the one writing this.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.040
And that night, when Paul finally pillows his head

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.959
and finally goes to sleep, God speaks to him.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.480
And God gives him a vision.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.600
I know sometimes we talk about eating pizza and doing things

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.559
like that and getting visions.

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.160
Please understand, that's not what's happening here.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.239
God is speaking to Paul.

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:58.480
And as I alluded to in the Sunday school hour

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.839
yesterday morning, this is an important moment.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.760
Because literally, God is calling

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.440
Paul and his missionary party not just to another city,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.279
but from Asia to the continent of Europe.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.559
And when Paul sees this vision and he

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.239
sees this Macedonian man, understand

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.839
that Macedonia is in present day Greece.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.600
And he wakes up from that vision.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.839
And boy, he stirs the party.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.959
Timothy, Silas, Luke, we've got to go.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.239
I know where God wants us to go.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:40.359
And they book fare on a ship.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:44.440
And the Bible tells us that they leave from Troas,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.399
the port.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:50.399
They sail to an island not too far off the coast, Samothracea.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.559
When they leave Samothracea, and again,

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.799
remember, they drop off cargo and they pick up cargo.

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:58.640
Where they're actually trying to get

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.600
is to a small port called Neapolis on the Greek coast.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.359
And when they land in Neapolis, Paul

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:13.160
makes a beeline for a little town called Philippi.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.799
Now, who in the world cares about Philippi?

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:21.079
Now, I consider myself an amateur historian.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:23.079
So in just about every sermon, you're

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.200
going to get a history lesson.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.720
And I don't want to see any frowns about it, all right?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.079
Sometimes we don't know the background of things

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:36.519
and we miss some of the important little things that

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.799
are said.

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.320
I want you to understand that Philippi

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.720
is a very important city from this standpoint.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.079
About 100 years before Paul shows up at Philippi,

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.079
there was a major battle that took place right outside

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.760
its gates.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.359
Two men, men named Brutus and Cassius,

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:06.959
you may remember who Brutus is, et tu Brute?

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.679
Brutus and Cassius were two of those

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:14.399
that murdered Julius Caesar, surprised him with the knives

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:18.480
and hundreds of knife thrusts into his body.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.200
And they killed Julius Caesar, intending

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.399
to seize the Roman Empire.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:27.679
There were two other important men, one of them Mark Anthony.

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:30.160
And he now has left Egypt.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.000
And he has sided with Octavian, who is a great Roman general.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.960
And those two armies, the armies of Brutus and Cassius,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.960
meet the army of Mark Anthony and Octavius

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.080
right outside of the city of Philippi.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.359
The citizens of Philippi decide that they're

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:57.159
going to aid and help Octavius and Mark Anthony.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:59.719
And those two win the battle.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.599
You say, this is fascinating stuff, preacher.

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:03.719
Now, wait a minute.

00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:05.840
Here's what becomes important.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.440
Octavius became Caesar.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.679
And he so appreciated what the Philippians did,

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:18.440
what that city of Philippi did, that he conferred on them

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.679
every citizen of Philippi.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:23.479
From that point on, their children

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:27.559
were born Roman citizens.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:32.119
Philippi actually becomes a Roman colony

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:35.520
and a Roman capital in that area.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.280
And those who would have never had any hope of Roman

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.799
citizenship are now made Roman citizens.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.840
You say, why is that important?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.760
Well, it's important for a number of reasons.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.200
Look at verse 12.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.440
And from thence to Philippi, which

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.119
is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,

00:09:56.119 --> 00:10:01.280
and a colony, it's a chief city.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.280
city, not because of its location, but because Octavius

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.280
made it a colony and gave them citizenship. Look at verse

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.280
21, and teach customs, talking about Paul's

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.280
preaching. Hey, he's teaching customs which are not

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.280
lawful for us to receive, neither to observe

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.280
being Romans. You say, what's the

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.280
importance here, preacher? They consider themselves Romans.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.280
And one of the things that it was very important

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.280
to do as a Roman citizen was to worship

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.280
Caesar. Now they had hundreds of gods, maybe thousands.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.280
But every year, you were to at least make

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.280
one small offering to Caesar. And they wanted

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.280
to protect being a Roman colony, and they wanted to

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.280
protect being Roman citizens, so when anybody

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.280
showed up and started saying there was another king,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.280
and there was a real, true God, and he

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.280
started preaching the gospel, brother, opposition was going

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.280
to be raised. Remember that. Remember that as we go

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.280
on in this. Well, when the Apostle Paul and Silas and Timothy

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.280
and Luke arrive at Philippi, there's no synagogue.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.280
Paul usually started preaching

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.280
in a synagogue. But a city had to have a certain number of

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.280
Jewish men to have a synagogue, and there were no

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.280
Jewish men, or not many Jewish men that were permanent residents

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.280
of Philippi. And so what you did, if you were

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.280
a Hebrew, if you were a Jew, you were instructed that if there

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.280
was no synagogue, if you were in a city, that on the Sabbath day

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.280
you were to find a quiet spot by the river, if there was a

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.280
river or a park, some quiet spot where you worship

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.280
the Lord. Now isn't that interesting that Paul and his

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.280
missionary party went to the riverside? They didn't just go to the riverside

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.280
because there was a park there. They went to the riverside because they

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.280
knew there would be people who were pious at that riverside.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.280
And when they arrive at that riverside, they

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.280
begin to preach the gospel. They begin to engage

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.280
with people, and one of the first ones that hear their preaching

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.280
is a woman named Lydia. And the Bible tells us that

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.280
Lydia, when she heard the preaching of the Word of God,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.280
accepted Christ as her Savior. And her family

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.280
accepted Christ as her Savior. And so grateful was

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.280
she that she actually came to the Apostle Paul and said,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.280
listen, I've got a place that we can meet. I've got a place

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.280
where we can teach. Please come to my home

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.280
and begin, I don't know that she would have understood it as a

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.280
church, but she wanted her home to be used as a

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.280
place where he could teach the Word of God.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.280
Now, understand this. Whenever you

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.280
have the gospel being preached, Satan

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.280
hates it. And you can guarantee that

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.280
his opposition is going to grow. Notice verse 16,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.280
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.280
a certain damsel, possessed with a spirit of divination,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.280
met us, which brought her masters much gain by

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.280
soothsaying. The same followed Paul and us,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.280
that's Luke writing, and cried, saying, These men are

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.280
the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.280
the way of salvation. And this did she many days.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.280
But Paul, being grieved, turned and said

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.280
to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.280
to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.280
Now, you say, preacher, why did Paul do that?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.280
She was agreeing. She was saying, hey, these men

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.280
preach the true God. These men are preaching real salvation.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.280
Well, please understand that one of Satan's great

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.280
tactics is to appear to be what we are.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.280
All through my ministry, I would have

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.280
people, preachers and other people, come and say, they would begin

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.280
something like this, now preacher, we're just like you.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.280
And when you've got to tell me you're just like me,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.280
you're probably not just like me, alright?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.280
What this young lady was doing was subtly

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.280
building herself up as,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.280
listen, these guys are here with my invitation.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.280
These guys are here with my approval.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.280
These guys are just like me. And the apostle Paul

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.280
knows that this is a demonic-filled young lady.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.280
He knows that this is not the true gospel.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.280
And he tries to be kind

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.280
and finally he understands, no, this is demon activity

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.280
and this young lady needs freed and this needs to be

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.280
stopped. And he casts that demon out of

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.280
that young lady by the power of God.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.280
Now again, notice in verse 19.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.280
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.280
they caught Paul and Silas, drew them into the

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.280
marketplace under the rulers, brought them to the magistrates

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.280
saying, these men being Jews,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.280
you wonder why there wasn't a synagogue there? These men being

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.280
Jews do exceedingly trouble our city.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.280
They teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.280
to observe, being Romans. And the multitudes rose up

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.280
together against them. And the magistrates rent off their

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.280
clothes and commanded to beat them. Now for the sake of time

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.280
I'm not going to read all the rest of the verses. You're very familiar with them.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.280
They are unfairly arrested, unjustly arrested.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.280
They are handed to the jailer who

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.280
proceeds to beat them. And I mean when you

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.280
received a beating in those days, it was a beating. He takes them

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.280
after beating them mercilessly, not caring about their condition.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.280
Takes them to the lowest part of his dungeon.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.280
Puts them in the stocks. Doesn't try to treat the

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.280
stripes on their back. And there in the bottom of his

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.280
jail comes midnight. And folks,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.280
we can't pretty this up. They're in agony. They're in agony.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.280
I've got a little hangnail and if

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.280
I'm a preacher, I'm outwept today for the pain

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.280
in my finger. I had to actually put peroxide on it.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.280
Do you feel sorry for me? No,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.280
I'm not trying to be silly, but I'm just trying to tell you these men are in agony.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.280
And you know what they do at midnight?

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.280
They don't curse the jailer.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.280
They don't shout to God how unfair they're being treated.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.280
They don't sing praises.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.280
And you remember what God did, don't you? You're in the bottom of the dungeon

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.280
and that's when God chooses to send an earthquake.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.280
I don't want an earthquake when I'm in the dungeon.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.280
But God sends an earthquake. They are set free. The other prisoners

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.280
are set free. And Paul encourages all to stay there.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.280
The jailer, you know what happens. He calls down

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.280
and he comes up with, what must I do to be saved? And Paul tells him

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.280
and he gets saved and all his family gets saved.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.280
And you know what we just saw? A very successful missions trip.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.280
Lydia is saved. Her family is saved.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.280
I like to believe this little girl got saved. She was so happy to be

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.280
free of that demon. I think she left the soothsayers and went over to Lydia's house.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.280
The jailer is saved and his family is saved.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.280
And Paul and Timothy and Titus and Luke are teaching this little church.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.280
And when they showed up, it was a demon

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.280
filled Roman colony. And when they left, there was a

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.280
church there. That's missions.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.280
Now, what I want to do is I want you to turn with me over to

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.280
Philippians chapter 4 and understand that as we

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.280
turn our pages to Philippians chapter 4

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.280
10 years have passed. And now the Apostle

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.280
Paul is not in Philippi. He's sitting in the city

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.280
of Ephesus. And from the city of Ephesus

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.280
he wants to write back to that group of

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.280
people, that church which no doubt has grown and their

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.280
influence has grown and their ministry has grown. And Paul

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.280
thinks of them often and is thankful for every time

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.280
he thinks of them and is grateful for the part that they now play

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.280
in his life. And he's writing this letter from Ephesus back

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.280
to this church at Philippi that was started in

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.280
such a difficult season. Notice it with

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.280
me starting in verse 10, chapter 4 verse 10.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.280
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.280
that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.280
wherein you were all so careful but you lacked

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.280
opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of want for I have

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.280
learned. In whatsoever state I am therewith

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.480
with to be content. I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere. And in all

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:15.080
things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.200
do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." Boy, don't ever take that verse lightly.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.720
You know what that means? That means when your back is bleeding and hurting, you can sing praises.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:35.160
That means when you're taken outside the city of Lystra and stoned and left for dead, you can get

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.800
up, shake off the dust and not be done with preaching, be committed to preaching. It means

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.200
you can go into Jerusalem and be smitten by the high priest and hated by them and sent to Rome,

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:55.200
and there put in prison, and then put in that filthy mammertine, the rat's nest, and know that

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.600
the Colosseum is next to you and you hear the screams of the crowd as the Christians are martyred

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:09.000
in front of them. Up above you is the Roman circus and you know that in that place they're putting

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.560
the Christians on the track and running over them with chariots and with horses, and then you can

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:23.160
say, I'm ready to be offered. Take me to the Colosseum. Take me to the circus because I can

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:31.720
do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Sometimes we cheapen that verse. It is not a

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:41.120
cheap verse. Not when you understand the man who uttered it. He says, notwithstanding ye have well

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.360
done that ye did communicate with my affliction. Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.880
of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving

00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:02.200
and receiving, but ye only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity, not

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:12.360
because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. But I have all and

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:20.480
abound. I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:30.600
sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. Oh, but my God shall supply all your need

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:43.840
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. What a holy passage. Let me very quickly show you

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.240
missions from the perspective of the missionary, missions from the perspective of the church,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:56.840
and missions from the perspective of the Lord. The role of the missionary in missions. I want

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:05.360
you to notice that ultimately the responsibility of a missionary is to know that the Lord is the

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:11.760
source of everything he needs. There's an important statement that's made in verse 11. Would you see

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:21.560
it? He says, for I have learned. The life of a missionary, if you study the Apostle Paul's life

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:31.120
and others, is not an easy one. It's an exciting life, it's a rewarding life, but it is not an easy

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.640
life. Consider modern-day missionaries, the challenges they face. Most missionaries, I see

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:44.600
the Alvarez's and they travel with two beautiful little girls. And those little girls are on duty

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:51.720
probably five nights a week in a church. And they better not run the aisle, and they better be

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.680
perfect in their behavior because the preacher and the deacons are watching. Pastor, that little girl

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:07.720
cried. I don't think they'll make it on the field. I'm telling you, it's not easy to pack your family

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:17.320
up and travel for two years, thousands upon thousands of miles, staying in places you don't

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.800
know where you're going to stay, you don't know who you're going to be staying with. Your children

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:29.240
are children, and you're human beings too. I guess there's an exciting side to it, but quite

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:36.120
frankly I'm glad for them to do it and not me. You're moving to a foreign country. You say, well

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:43.800
that's exciting. Yeah, you're not vacationing in a foreign country, you're moving to a foreign

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.280
country. You're going to learn everything new. You're going to learn a new language. Honestly,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:59.000
I am not trying to be humorous here. That's beyond me. I don't have enough think power to remember

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:06.280
English, much less to learn a new language. And listen, not just learn a new language,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:14.600
communicate eternal truth to a soul in that language. Come on, it's not just I want those

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:24.440
roles. It's without Christ you're going to hell, and it's an eternal difference in a person's life.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:32.600
It is no light thing. They learn that language. They learn a new culture. They're dependent on

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:39.240
exchange rates, churches dropping them. They answer to a hundred bosses with a hundred different

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.040
perspectives. You say, what do you mean preacher? They got a hundred supporting pastors, and we're

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.760
Baptists, and every one of those Baptist pastors sees something a little bit different than the

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.960
other Baptist pastor, and they answer to all of them. You say, are you feeling sorry for missionaries?

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.600
No, I don't feel sorry for them. I'm just trying to be realistic that when we talk about missionaries,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:12.040
it's not an easy thing to do. Through all that Paul says, I've learned. He learned to be content

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:19.480
even when circumstances were difficult, even when churches disappointed him, even when nationals

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:26.120
tried to kill him, because the ultimate source of his supply and the ultimate source of the help for

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:33.320
his life was not another missionary, not another person, not just a local church. It was God.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:43.480
God had called them, and that's why Paul says, I can do all things through my supporting churches.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:52.840
No, I can do all things through the team I work with here on the field. No, men will fail you,

00:26:52.840 --> 00:27:02.120
but I can do what God has called me to do through Jesus Christ. Man, that's what Paul says. I've

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:09.560
learned that. I've learned that your dependency missionary better be on the Lord. But now,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.960
wait a minute. Then he says this in verse 14, notwithstanding. Hey, I've learned how to be

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:23.800
content. I've learned how to trust only the Lord, but now look what he says. Notwithstanding,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:34.760
ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. Hey, God uses churches to do

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:44.120
his providing work. And Paul is expressing gratitude for the care of the church at Philippi.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:50.920
What a wonderful partnership when God uses a church to be a blessing to a missionary. Notice

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:59.000
with me how the church has a role in these missions outreaches. Number one, this great

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:08.280
church at Philippi understood they had a debt they owed. Notice with me in verse 15. Now,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:17.240
ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, what is Paul referring to there?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:24.440
Is Paul taking them back to the birth of Christ at Bethlehem? No. Is Paul taking them back to the

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:30.600
cross at Calvary? No. You know what Paul is taking them back to? Paul is saying now in the beginning

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:37.000
of the gospel, hey, church at Philippi, do you remember when I showed up at that riverside

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.400
and you had never heard of Jesus? And you didn't know there was a heaven?

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.040
And you didn't know there was a resurrection? And you didn't know there was one true God?

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:56.680
Remember in the beginning of the gospel when we stood at that riverside and told you the truth,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:03.560
and Lydia, you got saved and your household got saved? Hey, jailer. Hey, tough guy. Hey, listen,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:09.720
do you remember when you were ready to put a sword in your own stomach because you thought

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.400
the prisoners were gone? You remember we told you about Christ?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.960
Can I share this with you tonight?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:30.840
One of the essential things for every one of our lives is this. Remember where God got you.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:40.040
I've been preaching for 47 years. I am a good man. No, I'm not.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:50.760
No, I'm not. I'm a sinner saved by grace. And sometimes we've been around church so long that

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:58.200
we kind of think of ourselves as maybe a little better than them out there. But for the grace of

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.440
God, we are out.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:07.960
there, and when God found me and got me, God didn't reach up to a high shelf and

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:14.760
find Mike Edwards. Hey, there's a worthy find. God found me in a miry pit where He

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.600
found you, and He drug us out of that miry pit, and cleaned us up, and saved us,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:30.200
and we are tonight what we are by the grace of God. Get over yourself. We are

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:38.600
sinners, saved by God's grace, and what Paul is saying is, listen, do you remember

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.880
what you were? Do you remember where you were when God found you? And listen, that

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:54.160
is motivation to say this, if God can save me, God can save them. God can save

00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:02.880
that guy with 15 holes in his ear and a big widening. God can save that guy who

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.760
puts a needle in his arm. God can save that guy who's left his family

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.760
and deserted his children. I'm just telling you, God can save them, and God

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.000
help us to get over our sanctified selves. And remember that we've got a

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.680
debt, a debt that we owe, and they had a plan to pay that debt. Look in verse 14

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:32.240
again. You have well done that you did communicate with me. I love that word

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.760
communicate. In the Greek it's the word koinonia. We hear that word often. It just

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.360
simply means to share. It means they took what they had, and they shared it with

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.520
others. And what a wonderful picture of how the physical can be used to

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:57.840
accomplish the spiritual. These people gave. Now understand this, right now in

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:06.840
Macedonia things are not going well. The economy is not good, if you will. These

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.119
folks are suffering much affliction, yet even in the midst of that affliction, you

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:17.279
know what they said? We've got to send to Paul, because there are people that need

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:22.160
to hear the gospel, and we need to help him reach those people. And in the

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.119
midst of their affliction, they gave of themselves, and they gave what they had,

00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:36.080
because they knew they owed a debt. Quickly, I want you to notice how the

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:45.160
Lord viewed that. Look again at verse 17. Not because I desire a gift. Can I dispel

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.199
a notion if it's in this room? You know one of the hardest things for Gary

00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:58.839
Sadarsky to do? Come to a church and ask for support. Anybody want that job?

00:32:58.839 --> 00:33:03.520
Anybody want that job where you go from church to church to church, because God

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.639
has laid a call and a burden on your life, and you go and you say to the

00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:12.360
pastor, you try to get a meeting at the church, and you say to the church, will

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.279
you please help us? And you always say, will you pray for us? Because that is

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:23.720
valid, but you also know that you need dollars to get to that place. I don't

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:31.600
want that job. And yet that's the calling on their life. And Paul says, man, I'm not

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.360
coming to you by letter or person, because I desire a gift. I'm not a

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.600
moochinary. I'm not trying to enrich myself on going to the field. By the way,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:50.360
I have never met a rich missionary. I've met missionaries who are barely getting

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.680
by. I've met missionaries who are begging God to provide the need. I've never met a

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.960
rich one, and Paul says, I'm not coming because I desire your money,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:10.760
a desire, a gift. I need it, but I'm not trying to enrich myself. I'm coming

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:17.679
because I want me and you to bear fruit. Look what he says. Not because I desire a

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:28.080
gift, verse 17, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. I absolutely

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.119
love that verse, preacher. I don't want to dramatize this too much. I don't want

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:38.640
to go overboard, but I'm telling you, heaven is going to be an incredible

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:47.519
place. And there from every tribe and every tongue and every color of people,

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:54.080
every race, we are going to stand around the throne of God and kind of compete

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.720
with each other to see who can throw their crown quickest to the Lord, who is

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.839
deserving. And we are going to sing praises to Him. I think there'll be one

00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:11.559
language in heaven. But I'm fully expecting someday for somebody to come

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:16.399
up to me and say, now I know we've got perfect knowledge, but this is my

00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:21.519
illustration, so stay out of it. Somebody coming up to me and say, I want you to

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:29.480
know, I appreciate the gift that you made that allowed the Sadarskis to come

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:36.119
to Poland, that allowed Brother and Mrs. Alvarez to come to Mexico, Monterey, a

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:43.360
difficult place. Because when Brother Alvarez preached, when Mrs. Alvarez taught

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:51.279
that Sunday school lesson, I was a little girl and I got saved. You think sacrifice

00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:57.720
will be worth it that day? Fruit that abounds. Listen, he goes on and he says

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:03.640
this, but I have all and abound. I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:09.559
things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable,

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:16.119
well-pleasing to God. Hey, listen, they were not a rich church. And there were

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:22.160
times of affliction, but they dug into their pockets because they knew they had

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.959
a debt that there were others who needed Christ like they needed Christ, had

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:32.160
needed Him, and now had Him. And so they gave, and Paul says, let me tell you

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.399
how the Lord views that gift. And again, you forgive me for being a little

00:36:37.399 --> 00:36:43.480
dramatic. On Sundays we pass the offering plate, or at least give you the

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:49.720
opportunity to put something in the offering plate. Somewhere, sometime, some

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.160
Sunday, you've had a little struggle because you wanted to give something to

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.720
missions, but you also knew that you could have allocated that money this way.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.080
You could have prioritized that money this way, but it's just on your heart to

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:12.160
give to the missions program at church. And maybe with a little shaking hand, you

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.320
put that out, and it drops in the plate, and you know that you can't do the other

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.000
thing you wanted to do, but you just made a sacrifice and gave it to the Lord.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.200
And beyond our vision, beyond our understanding, I think something is true.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:39.760
That from that little offering plate and from your pew, something rises. You say,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:48.839
what is it? It's an odor. An odor of what? An odor that is pleasing to God. An odor

00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:56.119
that sees you saying, I can do without that. I'd rather meet this need. I'd

00:37:56.119 --> 00:38:02.160
rather this missionary have his need met. And as that ascends to the Lord, it is

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:10.200
pleasing to the Lord. I don't smell it. I don't see it. I understand it.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.839
Thanksgiving time, it's a big season at our house, and Christmas. It's actually

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:21.480
Christmas when my wife does this. She makes cinnamon rolls, homemade cinnamon

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:29.320
rolls. You ever had one? You ever had 30? She makes those cinnamon rolls, and

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.880
usually I'm in another room in the house, and she bakes for like seven days in a

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:39.000
row. I think it's a religious experience, but she bakes and bakes and bakes. And

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.799
when that oven door first opens up, you know what happens. Those cinnamon rolls

00:38:44.799 --> 00:38:52.960
and that odor fills the house. And I'm back in the other room, and I go, that's

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.239
pleasing to me. That's an acceptable offering to me. I don't mean to be silly,

00:38:59.239 --> 00:39:09.840
but that's the Lord. The Lord loves our willingness to sacrifice. And by the way,

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.919
when the Lord smells that, you say, well, I'll have to do without. Yeah, maybe. God

00:39:15.919 --> 00:39:22.440
will give you grace if you do. But can I remind you of the next verse? But my God

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:32.200
shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. We

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.119
read that verse, and we use that verse. Oh, it's on a lot of plaques, and

00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:42.359
on a lot of cross-stitch, and so on. And it is, in general, true about giving.

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:48.239
But I want you to understand this, that that verse is actually in context of

00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:55.960
missions giving. The actual context is Paul saying back to these poor Philippians,

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.599
you have done well. You have shared.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:05.959
even when you were short, even when you had needs,

00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:10.079
but you remembered the change in your life from the gospel,

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.839
and you understood that others needed that,

00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:15.319
and you took from the little you had,

00:40:15.319 --> 00:40:18.399
and you said, I can do this later, I'll put this off.

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:21.959
The real priority are the souls of men,

00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:25.759
and Paul reached souls, and oh goodness,

00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:29.079
the ones he reaches will abound to our account,

00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:34.079
and God is pleased, that's missions, that's missions.

00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:38.079
You wonder why we have revival in our churches

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:39.759
when we have missions conferences?

00:40:39.759 --> 00:40:44.759
Because we finally put ourselves aside and think of others.

00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:48.199
That's what missions does.

00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:54.159
I close with this, 1956, four young men,

00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:59.039
four young men, actually five, a fifth will join them,

00:40:59.919 --> 00:41:03.839
moved their families to Ecuador, to Quito, Ecuador.

00:41:05.279 --> 00:41:07.859
One of those men was named Jim Elliott,

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:14.079
and he so wanted to reach one particular tribe, the Aucas.

00:41:14.879 --> 00:41:17.839
They had had some success in reaching other tribes,

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:22.239
but the Auca Indians in Ecuador were a serious business.

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:24.239
They were killers.

00:41:24.239 --> 00:41:28.359
They had killed a number of workers on oil plantations.

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:32.119
They had killed others who had tried to come into their camp

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:35.359
and talk with them and civilize them, if you will.

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:40.019
But Jim Elliott and others had a real desire to reach them.

00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:41.319
They came up with a plan.

00:41:41.319 --> 00:41:44.199
Nate Saint was a pilot, he had a little plane,

00:41:44.199 --> 00:41:47.239
and he would fly over and drop gifts,

00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:50.719
and then they figured out a way to drop a bucket down,

00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:51.879
and they would put gifts in.

00:41:51.879 --> 00:41:54.519
And one day, after a couple of weeks of this,

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:57.639
the Aucas actually sent a gift back up.

00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:01.119
And they thought, this is it, we can reach them,

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.759
they're open to us now.

00:42:02.759 --> 00:42:05.399
And Nate Saint found a little place,

00:42:05.399 --> 00:42:07.919
a little strip to land on right by the river,

00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:10.759
and Jim Elliott went in, he dropped Jim off,

00:42:10.759 --> 00:42:14.439
and then three more trips to take the other three in.

00:42:14.439 --> 00:42:18.159
And they at first seemed to be making headway

00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:20.679
with the Auca Indians.

00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:22.719
But all of it was a ruse.

00:42:23.719 --> 00:42:26.839
Not long after that first day,

00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:30.159
two Auca women came out of the jungle

00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:32.599
on the other side of the river.

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:34.359
And they seemed to be coming in peace

00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:37.879
and seemed to be offering to talk.

00:42:37.879 --> 00:42:42.399
And Elliott and another man got into the river

00:42:42.399 --> 00:42:44.319
and started a cross to them.

00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:45.999
And as they were doing that,

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.999
they heard a rustling behind them,

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:52.999
and Auca men had jumped out of the woods

00:42:53.479 --> 00:42:56.159
with spears and bows and arrows,

00:42:56.159 --> 00:42:57.599
and were coming quickly,

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.679
and there was no doubt what was in their mind,

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:03.559
they were going to kill Jim Elliott, Nate Saint,

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:05.399
and the others who were in the river.

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:08.399
Now here's the unbelievable thing.

00:43:09.919 --> 00:43:13.799
Jim Elliott had a pistol in his coat.

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:17.759
He reached in to draw the pistol,

00:43:18.919 --> 00:43:21.279
and someone else looked at him and he looked at them

00:43:21.279 --> 00:43:22.919
because they had made a pact

00:43:24.479 --> 00:43:26.919
that the only thing they would use the pistol for

00:43:26.919 --> 00:43:29.159
was protection from animals.

00:43:29.159 --> 00:43:33.519
They would not kill an Auca Indian

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:36.679
because they knew that soul was lost.

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:41.199
Jim Elliott, Nate Saint, and three others

00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:43.299
were killed in that river that day.

00:43:44.759 --> 00:43:46.839
When they could have protected themselves.

00:43:48.639 --> 00:43:53.279
He wrote this, and to me it's incredible.

00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:56.919
Jim Elliott wrote, he is no fool

00:43:58.159 --> 00:44:00.359
who gives what he cannot keep

00:44:01.519 --> 00:44:04.839
to gain what he cannot lose.

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.839
Sometimes we are so careful

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:13.319
about holding on to everything we have here.

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:17.839
To making sure that we're cared for here,

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:22.799
and I'm a planner, I'm not for just being foolish.

00:44:24.399 --> 00:44:26.359
But I am saying this to you,

00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:28.759
that we owe a debt.

00:44:30.999 --> 00:44:35.279
And missions is the way that we can pay that debt.

00:44:37.519 --> 00:44:40.499
And God calls missionaries to go into places

00:44:40.499 --> 00:44:43.059
to do things that I don't want to do.

00:44:44.359 --> 00:44:48.319
But they're not the only ones who have to live by faith.

00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:50.199
We are called to live by faith.

00:44:51.279 --> 00:44:53.439
And we are called to be the rope holders.

00:44:53.439 --> 00:44:56.639
We are called to be the ones who give

00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:59.279
so that they can go.

00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:03.159
And I'm telling you, it takes them to sacrifice home

00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:06.119
and sacrifice a lot of things with family,

00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:07.679
sacrifice career.

00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:11.959
But listen, we are called upon to sacrifice.

00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:14.119
We are called to prioritize.

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.919
We are called to set one thing above another.

00:45:16.919 --> 00:45:21.839
We are called to do without sometimes.

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:25.399
Boy, not a message our generation wants to hear.

00:45:27.919 --> 00:45:31.039
But when God sees us say,

00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:35.419
there's something more important than filling my need,

00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:40.239
something more important than satisfying my want,

00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:46.259
I want to share what I have so that they can go,

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:50.999
so that they can preach, so that others can hear.

00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:55.519
And when we make that choice, God goes,

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:02.579
that's pleasing, that's acceptable.

00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:05.239
You ever heard this?

00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:06.759
You cannot out give God.

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:10.099
Well, the proof of it is there in verse 19.

00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:13.219
God says, when you've got that kind of heart,

00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:16.379
here's what I do for you, I'll supply all your need.

00:46:18.899 --> 00:46:19.779
Big circle.

00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:23.539
With this, I close.

00:46:23.539 --> 00:46:27.439
You know, I have never seen a U-Haul at a funeral.

00:46:29.379 --> 00:46:30.819
You ever seen it?

00:46:30.819 --> 00:46:33.299
I've never seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul

00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:36.699
because you don't take it with you

00:46:36.699 --> 00:46:39.099
and because there is something beyond this life.

00:46:40.539 --> 00:46:44.499
And what Jim Elliott said was, reprioritize.

00:46:45.779 --> 00:46:48.499
Really look out there at what really is important.

00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:53.099
Remember where God got you and how God changed your life

00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:58.619
and find some portion of your heart that can give.

00:46:59.619 --> 00:47:01.099
That can give.

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:03.519
God may be calling you to give your life.

00:47:03.519 --> 00:47:05.479
He may want you to go.

00:47:05.479 --> 00:47:08.099
Next time I preach, I want to preach about that.

00:47:09.099 --> 00:47:12.699
But God is definitely calling us, church,

00:47:14.419 --> 00:47:16.199
to set right priorities.

00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:22.459
And souls are the highest priority that God has.

00:47:23.339 --> 00:47:24.499
Would you pray with me?

00:47:25.419 --> 00:47:27.139
Father, help us to see truth.

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:30.479
I pray that you would speak to our hearts

00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:33.199
about the priorities in our lives.

00:47:35.179 --> 00:47:37.139
I don't think you want anybody to be foolish.

00:47:37.139 --> 00:47:39.639
I don't think you want missionaries to be foolish.

00:47:41.899 --> 00:47:46.219
But I do think you want us to be sacrificial.

00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:50.379
I do think you want us to care about souls.

00:47:50.379 --> 00:47:53.159
I do think you want us to remember where we were

00:47:53.159 --> 00:47:55.439
when you found us.

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.299
I do think you want us to consider

00:47:57.299 --> 00:47:59.839
how you've made our lives better,

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:03.339
how you've promised us beyond this life, eternal life.

00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:06.619
I do think you want us to remember

00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:08.579
that just as much as you loved us,

00:48:08.579 --> 00:48:11.159
you love every person in this world.

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:14.419
I do think you want us to remember

00:48:14.419 --> 00:48:16.379
that you want us to bear fruit.

00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:23.339
God, would you help us to prioritize?

00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:27.299
Would you help us to struggle with that in our lives?

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:30.179
What could we set aside?

00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:33.479
What could we do without?

00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:37.000
What could we change?

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.559
What desire could we put away?

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.559
What habit could we undo

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:50.239
that would allow us to give so that others can hear,

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:52.579
so that others can go?

00:48:54.079 --> 00:48:57.000
Lord, I pray that you would lay on our hearts tonight

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.719
that it's not just the missionaries who should pay a price,

00:49:01.719 --> 00:49:04.959
but we ought to be willing to sacrifice too.

00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:09.039
So in whatever way you desire,

00:49:09.039 --> 00:49:11.639
I pray you'd speak into the lives of people.

00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:15.639
Maybe they just need to struggle with their priorities.

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:19.479
Maybe they need to make a commitment

00:49:19.479 --> 00:49:22.359
that they're going to give more so that more can hear.

00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:26.679
Maybe there's one here tonight that you've been really,

00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:28.679
you've been dealing with them in their heart

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:30.880
and they know that you're dealing with them.

00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:35.919
Lord, may they just invite you in.

00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:40.719
And if it's a call to the field, then may they surrender.

00:49:40.719 --> 00:49:44.279
If it's a call to prioritize, may they make that choice.

00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:48.839
Lord, I pray you'd help us to see our need.

00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.919
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

00:49:52.919 --> 00:49:54.079
I'm gonna ask you to...
