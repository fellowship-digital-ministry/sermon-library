1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
33 this morning, Psalm 33,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,679
and hold your place here in Psalm 33.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,280
We'll be in Genesis chapter number one

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,920
quite a bit this morning as well,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,939
and so you might want to look at both of those places.

6
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,300
Stick a bookmark or a ribbon there, a bulletin, something,

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,600
and I'll be looking at this passage of Scripture.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,760
Trust it'll be a blessing to you.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,319
As you know, our theme for 2023 is Great is the Lord,

10
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,440
and I'm so thankful that our God is great,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,899
and as you know, I mentioned last week

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,159
that the message series,

13
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,280
the Sunday morning message series this year

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,860
will be designed so that it would help each of us

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,819
to recognize the greatness of God,

16
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,779
and then we will be challenged

17
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:42,680
to respond properly to his greatness,

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,459
and as we go through on Sunday mornings

19
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:47,580
with this plan and this idea,

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,900
for the next several weeks,

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,939
I want to deal with this subject matter

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,099
and examine several messages

23
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:57,439
dealing with God's greatness revealed through creation.

24
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,979
God's greatness revealed through creation.

25
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,099
This morning, the message,

26
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,979
if you've looked on the back of the bulletin,

27
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,900
the title is this,

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,139
He spake and it was done.

29
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,540
He spake and it was done.

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,300
In Psalm 33 and verse number six,

31
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,239
the Bible says this,

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,339
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made,

33
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:18,819
and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

34
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,860
He gathered the waters of the sea together as an heap.

35
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,120
He layeth up the depth and storehouses.

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,779
Let all the earth fear the Lord.

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,319
Verse nine, for he spake and it was done.

39
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,559
He commanded and it stood still.

40
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,199
Our God is the creator of all things.

41
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,800
The Bible declares that to us,

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,319
it reveals it to us.

43
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,919
I've often said over the years

44
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:52,319
that the truth of creation is not isolated

45
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,879
to the book of Genesis.

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,760
So often we go to the book of Genesis

47
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:56,860
and we will this morning

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,139
and we'll look at the first chapter of the book of Genesis

49
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,019
and we'll look at a number of verses of scripture

50
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,819
as God gives us the record of creation.

51
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,819
We understand that as you study the word of God

52
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,300
that the truth of creation

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,020
is not isolated to Genesis one and two.

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,339
We find that as you study throughout the word of God

55
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,779
that various portions of scripture

56
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:16,559
throughout the whole of scripture

57
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:19,979
reveal to us that God is the creator

58
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,619
and it reveals to us the handiwork of our God

59
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:25,199
and that which is given to us,

60
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,539
that which is revealed to us through creation.

61
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,460
Many of God's people as you study the scriptures,

62
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,539
they understood the greatness of God

63
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,360
as revealed through creation.

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,759
They stood in awe even as we see here

65
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,619
in verse number eight of him

66
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,220
because he is the creator God.

67
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,740
We see that Hezekiah and then later on the disciples,

68
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,880
we see that Jeremiah mentions this as well

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,419
but you see that they pray

70
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,419
and they recognize that they're praying to the creator God.

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,479
They're praying to the one that spoke

72
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,320
and it was done as we see in our text of scripture

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
here this morning.

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,779
We understand that God, our God is the creator God.

75
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,320
That ought to increase our faith.

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,940
That ought to encourage us as we go through life,

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,800
as we deal with trials and difficulties

78
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,740
and we spoke of some of that this morning

79
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,899
in our Sunday school hour

80
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,679
as we examine some of what the disciples experienced

81
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,279
in the persecution there in Acts chapter number four

82
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:24,399
and we understand that we face difficulties

83
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,580
just as Hezekiah was facing the most powerful army

84
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,339
of that time, the Assyrians.

85
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,380
They'd taken Israel captive

86
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,580
and they're there threatening to take Judah captive

87
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,580
but Hezekiah prays and recognizes that God is the creator

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
and as the creator, the Assyrian army is no trouble for him.

89
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,940
Oh, Hezekiah could not defeat the Assyrian army

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,100
in his own power.

91
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,699
There was nothing he could do

92
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:58,399
but God, the creator God was able to defend His people

93
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
and you read the account

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,259
and you see that He did in a miraculous way.

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,080
God gives Jeremiah a promise.

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,860
He gives him a command before He gives him the promise

97
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,080
and the command is to buy the field.

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,440
It was very interesting as you study the book of Jeremiah

99
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,079
that Jeremiah is prophesying

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
The children of Israel because of their disobedience

102
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,940
had already been taken captive by the Assyrians

103
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,339
as I mentioned a moment ago.

104
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,980
The Judah, the Southern tribes,

105
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,339
those two tribes of the South,

106
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,820
they too followed in the wicked ways of Israel

107
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,160
and they too would face captivity.

108
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,559
Their captivity, however,

109
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,179
would be at the hands of the Babylonians.

110
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:41,660
God would allow that and God was judging His people.

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,059
We know that the Bible tells us

112
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,380
that it was going to be a 70-year captivity

113
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,100
and you read that and Jeremiah is prophesying

114
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,940
on the eve of that captivity.

115
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,559
In fact, as he's prophesying,

116
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,600
you could see that the Babylonians were already ready

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,279
and they had besieged the city

118
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,559
and then God says, Jeremiah, buy this field.

119
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,600
What an interesting piece of instruction

120
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,880
to buy a piece of field

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,440
when you know that the land is going to be taken

122
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,239
and you're going to be captives.

123
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,880
And as Jeremiah prays in response to God's answer,

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,880
he says, oh Lord God, thou hast made the heavens.

125
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,380
You begin to see how Jeremiah recognized

126
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,779
that the creator God was able to fulfill the promise

127
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,420
that he gave with regard to a remnant that would return

128
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,779
and indeed, the remnant returned.

129
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,799
We read of that and we understand that historical truth

130
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,820
and this morning as we begin to as the people of God,

131
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,040
as we desire to see God and all of his greatness

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,040
and we start here with looking at how God's greatness

133
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,679
is revealed to us through creation

134
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,000
and we see that the psalmist says,

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,260
for he spake and it was done.

136
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,239
What is it about God's greatness

137
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,600
that is revealed to us through creation?

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,799
If you're taking notes this morning,

139
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,799
number one, creation reveals that our God is omnipotent.

140
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,100
Creation reveals that our God is omnipotent.

141
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,940
In other words, that he is great in power,

142
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,859
that he has all power.

143
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,660
He said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

144
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,540
Jesus said that in Matthew 28.

145
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,739
We read the book of Revelation,

146
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,899
the Bible says the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

147
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,279
We find that creation reveals to us

148
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,019
that our God is omnipotent.

149
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,160
We find that there are many other truths

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,320
within the word of God and interactions

151
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,500
with the people of God where God reveals his great power

152
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,040
but no doubt creation reveals to us

153
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,480
the very power of God and that our God is omnipotent.

154
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
Turn to the book of Genesis, if you will,

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,920
in the first chapter and you find here

156
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,279
in the first chapter the record

157
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,600
that God gives us of creation

158
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,320
and as we note the statement of the psalmist

159
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,179
in Psalm 33, he spake and it was done,

160
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:06,040
we'll go through Genesis chapter number one

161
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,220
and we'll skip around some of the verses

162
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,420
and begin to see here this morning

163
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,019
how that God reveals to us

164
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,160
and you'll see this recurring statement

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,540
that God said and it was so.

166
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,420
He spake and it was done.

167
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,380
In Genesis chapter number one,

168
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,500
you see the first reference in verse number three

169
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,260
to God speaking, it says that and God said,

170
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,019
notice what he said, let there be light

171
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,839
and there was light.

172
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,559
The third verse of the Bible that is so precious

173
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:47,820
and powerful and profitable for us

174
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,320
tells us that God said, let there be light

175
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,720
and there was light, it's amazing.

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
The power of God Almighty as seen through creation.

177
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,579
In verse number six, if you skip down to day two,

178
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,100
you find that the Bible begins in verse number six

179
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,179
by saying again, God said and in verse six and seven

180
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,899
records for us what he says, let there be a firmament

181
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,059
in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters

182
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,059
from the waters and God made the firmament

183
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,579
and divided the waters which were under the firmament

184
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,019
from the waters which were above the firmament

185
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,380
and then notice the phrase at the end of verse number seven

186
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,899
and it was so.

187
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,979
God said, we read everything that God said

188
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,799
and it was so, reveals to us the power of God.

189
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,799
On day number three, beginning in verse number nine,

190
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,719
the Bible says and God said, let the waters under the heaven

191
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,400
be gathered together unto one place

192
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,820
and let the dry land appear and again,

193
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,119
you note those words and it was so.

194
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:57,280
And God called the dry land earth and the gathering

195
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,880
together the waters called he sees and God saw

196
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,059
that it was good and this is still the third day

197
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,859
on verse number 11, he speaks again, it says and God said,

198
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,940
let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed

199
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,580
and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind

200
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,799
whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so.

201
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,979
The earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed

202
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:22,200
after his kind and the tree yielding fruit

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,700
whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw

204
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,380
that it was good and the evening and the morning

205
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,460
were the third day.

206
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,359
Verse number 14 reveals to us on day number four,

207
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:37,559
again, the same truth that God said and it was so,

208
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,359
let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven,

209
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,280
divide the day from the night, let them be for signs

210
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,000
and for seasons and for days and years,

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,119
let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven

212
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:51,760
to give light upon the earth and it was so.

213
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,479
You understand this morning that we live in a time

214
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,219
in which, in fact, for many centuries now,

215
00:09:58,219 --> 00:09:59,940
the record of creation.

216
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,460
has been attacked.

217
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,960
I've often said in personal conversations and even from this pulpit publicly that the

218
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,280
attack on the Genesis record of creation is so just obvious in the day in which we're

219
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,020
leaving and they're constantly attacking the Genesis record.

220
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Why?

221
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,420
Because if they can destroy the foundation, everything else crumbles.

222
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:35,900
If God cannot be trusted in Genesis 1, how can we trust God in John 3?

223
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,900
If God cannot be trusted with regard to creation, how can God be trusted with regard to redemption?

224
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,060
Do you see the attack of the enemy?

225
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,740
Do you see why he's so targeted on this thing of creation and we live in a day with all

226
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:58,220
sorts of theories and all sorts of ideas of where this world began, where we see the start

227
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,980
and all those types of things, but God says in the first page of the Word of God, he reveals

228
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,020
to us how he created and the power that is on display.

229
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:15,100
On day number five in verse number 20, the Bible says this, and God said, we find again

230
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,860
in verse number 24, on day number six, and God said, we find again on day number six

231
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:29,860
in verse number 26, and God said, we find that God spoke and it was so.

232
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:38,300
I'm so thankful that our God has that kind of power, amen?

233
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,180
The theories that are out there that exist as to how this world began and how it all

234
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,959
started, they seek to remove God.

235
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,220
And we understand why because Romans chapter 1 tells us that they want to deny the existence

236
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,100
of the Creator because really they don't want to be accountable to the Creator.

237
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,660
But when we understand that God is the Creator and we are His creation, then we become accountable

238
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,220
to Him.

239
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,220
And man, simply put, does not want to be accountable to God.

240
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,779
So they want to deny the existence of God.

241
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:24,699
They come up with their theories, as silly as they may be, and they try to peddle their

242
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,699
thinking and they've permeated our school systems.

243
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,860
They have permeated our society.

244
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,300
But I'm here to tell you this morning that our God is the Creator God, and our God has

245
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
all power.

246
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,100
And listen, when I understand and I begin to think about and have as our theme this

247
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:49,979
year that great is the Lord, and I think about His great power, I see it in creation.

248
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:55,500
And I stand in awe of Him and I say that my God has that kind of power just as Hezekiah

249
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,900
prayed and just as Jeremiah prayed and just as the disciples prayed and just as you and

250
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,660
I have the opportunity to understand that the Creator God is my God, is our God, that

251
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,460
He has all power.

252
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,100
He has great power.

253
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,479
There's nothing in your life, there's nothing in my life that's too hard for Him.

254
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:25,540
He says to Abraham, He'd given a promise about a son, but we're old.

255
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,619
Abraham and Sarah, we're old, we're past the time of childbearing.

256
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:39,820
God reveals Himself with the name of El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and He says to Abraham,

257
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,820
is anything too hard for God?

258
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,740
This morning when we think about creation and we look at the first chapter of the Word

259
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,900
of God, we see that creation reveals to us that our God is omnipotent, that He has all

260
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,979
power.

261
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,960
He is great in power.

262
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,020
Not only does creation reveal to us that our God is omnipotent, but number two, creation

263
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,619
reveals to us that our God is omniscient, that He is great in wisdom, that He has all

264
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,380
knowledge.

265
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,779
Keep your place here in Genesis 1, but turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will, in Isaiah

266
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,420
chapter 48, and we'll look at two verses of Scripture and I'll read them for you, but

267
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,100
I want to look at these two verses of Scripture and help us this morning to consider the wisdom

268
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,339
of God as seen through creation.

269
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,619
It reveals to us that our God is not only omnipotent, that He has all power, but our

270
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,220
God is omniscient, that He has all wisdom and all knowledge and He's great in power

271
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,080
and He's great in wisdom.

272
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,779
And we find that as we look here at Isaiah 48 and verse 13, the Bible says, mine hand

273
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:51,959
also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens.

274
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,339
When I call unto them, they stand up together.

275
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,899
Hebrews says something very similar in Hebrews 1 and verse number 10.

276
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,459
I'll read the verse of Scripture for you, but in Hebrews 1 and verse number 10, the

277
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:09,220
Bible says, and thou, Lord, in the beginning hath laid the foundation of the earth, and

278
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,179
the heavens are the works of thine hands.

279
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,660
We see His power, but we see His wisdom.

280
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,500
It's very interesting as you would consider creation and you would consider this morning

281
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,500
as we begin to understand the record that is provided to us here in the book of Genesis

282
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,299
with regard to creation.

283
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,380
We see that God has all power, but He has all wisdom, He has all knowledge.

284
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,160
We consider this morning the stability of God's creation.

285
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,220
The fact that God has created, but He's given stability in His creation.

286
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,339
You think about all of the formulas that people use in mathematics and the sciences and all

287
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,019
of those things, why is it that they work?

288
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,739
Because God holds it all together, because He's given stability in His creation.

289
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:04,239
You think about gravity, you think about the tilt of the earth that's at 23 and a half

290
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:10,380
degrees and how that tilt of earth provides for us seasons, and why is it that we come

291
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,820
to certain times of the year and we say, well, the calendar's about to change, we're

292
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,299
gonna have this season and we're gonna go from winter to spring and spring to summer

293
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:24,179
and summer to winter and so on to fall and then to winter and you see the seasons and

294
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,339
we happen to live in a particular region of the world where we get all four seasons.

295
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,459
Some places they just get a couple of seasons because of where they're located on earth,

296
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,660
but we see that there's still that season that they will have, that they will experience.

297
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,299
They say that we have two seasons, we have hot and hotter.

298
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,980
Some places of the earth are like that.

299
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,019
We have wet, we have dry.

300
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,019
They have seasons.

301
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:53,100
It's a result of the tilt of the earth, the stability of God's creation.

302
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,540
You think about the magnetic field and all of these things and you begin to see how God

303
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,100
gave stability.

304
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,899
Not only did God give stability, and this is because of His wisdom, because of His knowledge.

305
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:11,420
He gave stability, but He also considered, if you would this morning, that God's creation

306
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,380
is suitable for life.

307
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,660
We live in a time where they're spending billions of dollars to try to find life somewhere else.

308
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:30,459
They're trying to find life somewhere else and then they deny what life really means

309
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,500
here on this earth.

310
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,140
And they don't value life.

311
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,019
Isn't that amazing?

312
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,459
They don't value the one, they don't acknowledge the one who gives life.

313
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:46,339
But you begin to think about God making the earth, the creation, and where we are here

314
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:50,179
and understanding that He made earth suitable for life.

315
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,500
And the distance from earth to the sun is 93 million miles.

316
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:03,179
You know, with just a slight variation, either closer or further away, earth could not support

317
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,779
life.

318
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:12,459
The temperature differences and just some minor changes to that distance would not allow

319
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,059
for life on earth.

320
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,220
That's God's wisdom, it's God's knowledge.

321
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,540
We find that earth's journey around the sun, I mentioned that it's 93 million miles from

322
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:30,860
earth to the sun, but the journey that we take annually around the sun is 584 million

323
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
miles.

324
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,539
Man, that's a long distance.

325
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,539
It is.

326
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,020
584 million miles.

327
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,059
It takes 365 and a quarter days to do that and you can calculate it and it is consistent

328
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,260
to one thousandth of a second.

329
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
It's amazing.

330
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,299
But you know what's interesting?

331
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:58,979
If that journey around the sun took longer or took shorter, it would mess with life on

332
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,880
earth.

333
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,599
It would change the temperatures of earth and not allow for earth to support life.

334
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,159
Pastor, why are we dealing with this?

335
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,320
I didn't come to science class this morning because creation reveals to us that our God

336
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,460
has all wisdom, that He's great in wisdom and we stand in awe of Him.

337
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,359
We think about the rotation of the earth, we understand, as I mentioned, a 584 million

338
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,099
mile journey around the sun, but then you understand that the earth is rotating every

339
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:37,200
day and we have this rotation that goes and we have night and morning and the day and

340
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,400
the evening, the sun and the moon and so on and so forth and changes to the rotation daily

341
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,440
would affect earth that there would be some places that would be colder and some places

342
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,400
that would be warmer and again, not allowing for life to exist in certain places.

343
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,239
I want you to read a verse with me in the book of Job.

344
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,799
In Job chapter number 9.

345
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,339
Because when I begin to think about creation,

346
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,939
and I begin to think about the greatness of God,

347
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,939
I'm thankful that God's creation

348
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,299
reveals to me his greatness.

349
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,159
I'm thankful that when I observe these things

350
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,459
about creation that I'm standing in awe of who he is,

351
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,579
and I'm seeing that our God is great in power,

352
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:21,699
that he is omnipotent, that he has all power.

353
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:24,459
I'm thankful that he is great in wisdom,

354
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:27,739
that he's omniscient, that he has all knowledge.

355
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,199
And we come to the book of Job in the ninth chapter.

356
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:33,799
We find that Job is replying to a so-called friend.

357
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,259
They're miserable comforters.

358
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,499
They've come to him because of some experiences

359
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,779
that have taken place.

360
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,439
In chapter number one, you can read of them.

361
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,279
I mean, it's terrible what's happened in the life of Job,

362
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,759
but he retains his integrity.

363
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,679
He continues to serve God, and these men show up,

364
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,999
and they try to give him comfort,

365
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,959
and again, they're not very good comforters.

366
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,979
But Job answers, and in his answer,

367
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,319
he reveals to us something about the Lord

368
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,859
that is so precious.

369
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,339
Notice in verse number four of Job nine,

370
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,619
speaking of God, Job says this.

371
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:07,619
He, God, is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

372
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,979
I said that God's creation reveals that he's omnipotent,

373
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,139
that he has all power.

374
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,119
I said that God's creation reveals to us

375
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,259
that he is omniscient, that he has all knowledge.

376
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,539
He's great in power.

377
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:23,979
He's great in knowledge.

378
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:28,399
And we see that these two truths are inseparable,

379
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:31,359
and they're absolutely essential.

380
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,679
Isn't it wonderful to know that our God

381
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,579
knew exactly what to do, but then had the power to do it?

382
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,639
Think about that.

383
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,719
You ever in a situation where you have the power

384
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,039
to do something, but you don't have the knowledge

385
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,039
of how to do it?

386
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:51,479
House repairs.

387
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,939
Huh.

388
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,579
I might have a certain amount of strength

389
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,219
to be able to do the work, but I have no knowledge

390
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,019
of how to fix the problem.

391
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:04,299
What about someone that has the knowledge

392
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,139
to fix the problem, but no longer has the power to do it?

393
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,419
When I first arrived here to pastor

394
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,259
Fellowship Baptist Church 11 1⁄2 years ago,

395
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:20,719
Miss Jackie Sundeen said something to me about Ed

396
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,899
that made me laugh.

397
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,099
I still remember it.

398
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,859
She said this.

399
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,219
I was talking about sending an email,

400
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:32,379
and she said, Mr. Ed, he could build you a house,

401
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,939
but he can't click a mouse.

402
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,339
Ha ha.

403
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,379
That's what she said.

404
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:41,559
Mr. Ed and technology, they don't go together.

405
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,279
But you know what Ed's told me in recent years?

406
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,699
Ed could build a house.

407
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,719
He's wired lots of houses.

408
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,079
Super handy guy.

409
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,039
You know what he says, pastor?

410
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,999
I just don't have the strength anymore.

411
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,439
I just can't do it anymore.

412
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,159
There's been some projects here at church

413
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,999
that I've called Ed, and I said,

414
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:08,079
hey, Ed, would you help me with something?

415
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,839
He says, I don't think I have the power to do it.

416
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,239
I said, no, I don't need your strength.

417
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,379
I need your mind.

418
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,879
Because I can do the work, I just don't know

419
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,219
exactly what to do.

420
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:21,619
So Ed, what I need you to do is I just need you

421
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,499
to tell me step by step what to do,

422
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:25,339
and then I'll do the physical part

423
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,939
so that we can take care of this problem.

424
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,499
And we've accomplished a number of tasks that way.

425
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,739
But with our God, he is, as Job said,

426
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:40,699
wise in heart and mighty in strength.

427
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:43,979
Not only did he know what to do with creation,

428
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,679
but he had the power to do it.

429
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,719
And that's so exciting.

430
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,319
Because if he had the power to do it

431
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,519
but didn't know how to do it, it'd be chaos.

432
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,119
And if he had the knowledge to do it

433
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,599
but not the power to do it, it'd never happen.

434
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,599
But God has all power.

435
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,839
God has all wisdom.

436
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,519
He is great in power.

437
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,959
He is great in wisdom.

438
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,319
Listen, that ought to encourage us this morning.

439
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,759
That ought to cause us this morning

440
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,459
as we think about this theme, great is the Lord,

441
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,559
and we say, oh, our God, he is great.

442
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,139
How do I know that he's great?

443
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:20,579
What is it that reveals to me?

444
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,299
Because I want to recognize, I want to be aware

445
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,579
of the fact that God is great.

446
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:28,940
Well, creation reveals his greatness.

447
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,979
It reveals that he's omnipotent.

448
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,839
It reveals that he's omniscient.

449
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,079
Let me say this.

450
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:38,859
Number three this morning, back in Genesis chapter number one,

451
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:43,859
creation reveals that our God is a God of order.

452
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,599
Creation reveals that our God is a God of order.

453
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,739
I'm thankful that God is a God of order.

454
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,119
It's not chaos with God.

455
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,899
There's no confusion with God.

456
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,279
God says to us as his people,

457
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,919
it's recorded in the book of 1 Corinthians,

458
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,440
let all things be done decently and in order.

459
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,619
And we find that our God is a God of order,

460
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,659
and we see it in the very first chapter of the Bible,

461
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,319
because creation reveals that he's omnipotent,

462
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,379
that he's omniscient, but that he's a God of order.

463
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,019
Notice with me, think of this,

464
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,059
that there is logic in creation.

465
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,419
There's logic in creation.

466
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,139
On day number two, we find that Genesis reveals to us

467
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,239
that God, he separated the sky.

468
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:43,039
It says in verse number six, it says this,

469
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,399
let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,

470
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,559
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

471
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,079
And God made the firmament and divided the waters

472
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,639
which were under the firmament from the waters

473
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,879
which were above the firmament,

474
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:55,319
and it was so, and God called the firmament heaven,

475
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,479
and the evening and the morning were the second day.

476
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:59,799
And we find that this was done on day number two,

477
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,759
but it was on day number five.

478
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,559
If you continue to read through the passage of scripture,

479
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,339
you come to day number five,

480
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,500
and you find in verse number 21 that the Bible says,

481
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,579
and God created great whales and every living creature

482
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:13,179
that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly

483
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,139
after their kind.

484
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,220
But look at the end of verse number 21,

485
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,500
and every winged fowl after his kind,

486
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,139
and God saw that it was good.

487
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,979
So on day number two, he separated,

488
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,940
and he made the heaven the sky,

489
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,500
and on day number five, he filled it with life.

490
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,859
He didn't make the fowls first,

491
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,739
and then figure out where to put them.

492
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,039
On day number three, he formed the sea.

493
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,419
The Bible says in verse number nine,

494
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,859
let the waters under the heaven be gathered together

495
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,139
under one place, and let the dry land appear,

496
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,259
and it was so, and God called the dry land earth,

497
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,899
and gathered, and the gathering together of the waters

498
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,519
called he seas, and God saw that it was good.

499
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,619
So on day number three, God formed the sea,

500
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,899
and we've already read verse number 21,

501
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,959
that God, in verse number 20 says this,

502
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,819
and God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly

503
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,879
the moving creature that hath life,

504
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:06,799
and fowl that they may fly above the earth

505
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,199
in the open firmament of heaven,

506
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:11,359
and so God created the sea on day number three,

507
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,959
but then he filled it with life on day number five.

508
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,639
You know, how long do fish last out of water?

509
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,799
Most of them not long, right?

510
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,959
If you're a fisherman, and I'm not,

511
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,919
but if you're a fisherman, if you're catching fish,

512
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,000
not just wasting time, but you're catching fish,

513
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,159
amen, Brother Sammy?

514
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,539
And Brother Sammy's our resident fisherman,

515
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,099
and if you're gonna go fishing, you wanna catch,

516
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:38,659
and not get a sunburn, and all that other nonsense,

517
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,339
you wanna catch fish, but if you're catching fish,

518
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,019
if you leave them out of the water too long,

519
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:47,459
they're gonna die, that's what fish do.

520
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,220
God didn't create fish on day three,

521
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,539
and then leave them out of water for two days.

522
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:57,819
No, he created the sea on day three,

523
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,759
and then on day number five, he filled it with life.

524
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,659
Our God is a God of order.

525
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,079
Think about this, on day three,

526
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,979
we've already read the verse in verse number nine,

527
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,279
where the Bible says that he formed the dry land,

528
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,039
and he called the dry land, he called it earth,

529
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,319
and the gathering together of the water,

530
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,119
in verse 10, he called seas.

531
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,239
Notice what else he did on the third day,

532
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,359
in verse number 11, it says,

533
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,399
and God said, let the earth bring forth grass,

534
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,599
the herb yielding sea, and the fruit tree yielding fruit,

535
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,979
after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth,

536
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:32,179
and it was so.

537
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,779
And it says this in verse number 12,

538
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,659
and the earth brought forth grass,

539
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,700
and herb yielding seed after his kind,

540
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,059
and the tree yielding fruit,

541
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,559
whose seed was in itself after his kind,

542
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,459
and God saw that it was good,

543
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:45,339
in the evening, in the morning, or the third day.

544
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:47,140
And so we find on day number three,

545
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,419
not only did God form the dry land,

546
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,979
but on day number three, he also brought forth vegetation.

547
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,219
You know what that vegetation would be?

548
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:57,260
It would be a source of food.

549
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,179
Because God knows that his creation needs sustenance.

550
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,099
And so he made the land, he made the vegetation,

551
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:09,899
and then we come to day number six,

552
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:12,219
and the Bible says this in verse number 24,

553
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,880
and God said, let the earth bring forth

554
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,700
the living creature after his kind,

555
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,739
cattle and creeping thing,

556
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:21,099
and beast of the earth after his kind,

557
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,459
and it was so.

558
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,539
God made the beast of the earth after his kind,

559
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:25,739
and cattle after their kind,

560
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:27,219
and everything that creepeth upon the earth

561
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,459
after his kind, and God saw that it was good.

562
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,519
So God made the land animals after he made the land,

563
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,839
and after he made the food source.

564
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,000
Because our God is a God of order.

565
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,640
And we find that just reading Genesis chapter number one,

566
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,640
answers so many questions that people are debating over

567
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,140
and fumbling over today.

568
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,959
Professing themselves to be wise.

569
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:04,039
But Romans 1 says they became fools.

570
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,039
Why?

571
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,759
Because they deny the Creator.

572
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:15,799
See our God created all things and there's order in His creation.

573
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:17,599
Listen, there's logic.

574
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,639
It makes sense how God made, how God formed.

575
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,899
Why was there logic to His creation?

576
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,719
Why is there order to His creation?

577
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:29,039
Well because He's omnipotent and He's omniscient.

578
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,239
And thus you find that there's order in His creation.

579
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:37,419
Not only do we see the logic in creation, but I believe this morning that you see longevity

580
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,679
of His creation.

581
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:44,259
In other words, I would say this, the ability to reproduce.

582
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,359
The ability to reproduce.

583
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,499
We find that as we study this first chapter of the book of Genesis that you will know

584
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:51,499
a phrase.

585
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:55,599
In fact, I've said it often already this morning.

586
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,439
There's the phrase God said and it was so, and we've mentioned that in our first thought

587
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,719
and our first point.

588
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:05,119
But then there's this other phrase that is repeated here throughout the record of creation

589
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:11,099
in Genesis 1, and it's this phrase, after His kind.

590
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:12,759
After His kind.

591
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,399
This is so important.

592
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:22,279
This foundational, fundamental truth of God's Word is so very important.

593
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:27,079
We find that it was on day three in verses 12 and 13, and again we've read the verses,

594
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,559
but notice with me, because I want you to note the phrase where it says after His kind.

595
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,219
Look in verse number 11 actually.

596
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:36,679
It says, let the earth, and God said let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding

597
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,799
seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit, notice, after His kind, whose seed is in itself upon

598
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,399
the earth and it was so.

599
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:48,599
Verse 12, and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed.

600
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:55,439
Notice again, after His kind, and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself, again

601
00:31:55,439 --> 00:32:02,319
a third time, after His kind, and God saw that it was good.

602
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,399
We see this on day number three.

603
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,199
We see this again on day number five in verse number 21.

604
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:13,719
The Bible says this, and God created great whales and every living creature that moveth

605
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:16,399
which the waters brought forth abundantly.

606
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:25,199
Notice, after their kind, and every winged fowl, after His kind, and God saw that it

607
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,199
was good.

608
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,999
You say, pastor, why are you belaboring the point?

609
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,439
Because we live in a confused world.

610
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:40,479
They don't understand kind, but in the first chapter of God's Word, He reveals to us His

611
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:46,439
power, He reveals to us His wisdom, and He reveals to us that He's a God of order.

612
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:50,039
There's logic in creation, but there's longevity in creation.

613
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,639
There's this ability to reproduce, and we see the phrase, after His kind.

614
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,239
We see it again on day number six.

615
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:00,079
It says in verse number 24, and God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature,

616
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,559
after His kind, cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, after His kind, and

617
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,559
it was so.

618
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,759
after His kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth

619
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,479
after His kind, and God saw that it was good.

620
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,639
You say, did He have to keep repeating it?

621
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:23,999
Yes, because He wants you to understand that there's order in creation, and God has made

622
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,679
it that way.

623
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,239
This is a critical truth, a critical truth.

624
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:36,479
The genetic code within the DNA, and some of you are much smarter than I am with regard

625
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:42,439
to all of that, but it's my understanding, as I've done some studying, that the genetic

626
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:53,879
code within the DNA allows for a wide variation horizontally within kind, but no vertical

627
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:59,399
evolution from one kind to another kind.

628
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,679
Does that make sense?

629
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,519
So within the genetic code, the Almighty God, the all-wise God, I could never figure this

630
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:15,319
out, you could never figure this out, but God Almighty, who has all power and all wisdom,

631
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:22,919
He created and He made after their kind, and He allowed within the genetic code for there

632
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:30,199
to be this variation horizontally within kind, but there would be no vertical evolution from

633
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,319
one kind to another kind.

634
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:41,639
The horizontal variation that we see allows for adaptability, but not for evolution.

635
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,479
It's very important for us to understand that.

636
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:47,919
Listen, they're trying to breed dogs today that really aren't dogs.

637
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,999
They don't bark, they don't shed, right?

638
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,439
That's what dogs do, right?

639
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,919
And they're trying to breed these dogs that don't do this.

640
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:05,119
We have a golden retriever, and that golden retriever, he sheds, hallelujah.

641
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,639
I won't say any more.

642
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,879
It's my understanding that people that are in the dog breeding world, they're taking

643
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:20,559
golden retrievers and they're trying to breed them with poodles because poodles don't shed

644
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,799
and they want to have a golden doodle.

645
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:29,359
I'm not making this stuff up.

646
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:39,079
They are cute, I agree, but you understand that that's only possible because a golden

647
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,359
retriever and a poodle are of the same kind.

648
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:49,799
They're dogs.

649
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:58,439
You're not taking a dog and you're not taking a cat and getting anything except a fight.

650
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,079
Right?

651
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,599
Listen, I'm not a science major, I just read the Bible.

652
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,239
And I'm not trying to be, I don't want it to come across prideful or anything.

653
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:18,439
I'm just simply saying in the first chapter of God's Word, He reveals to us that He has

654
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:27,599
all power, that He has all wisdom, and that He is a God of order.

655
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,699
In the first chapter of Genesis, you get all of that.

656
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:34,319
We haven't even gotten to the man part, when God creates man.

657
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:38,159
We're going to deal with that next week because I don't have time in one message to deal with

658
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,799
all of it.

659
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:46,639
But the reality this morning is that we see and we understand, listen, we understand this

660
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,279
practically, but we debate about it philosophically.

661
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,479
Why?

662
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,759
Because man does not want to acknowledge God.

663
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,799
That's really the bottom line.

664
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:04,439
Look at what Jesus said, I'll read it to you in Luke chapter number 6, and I want you to

665
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,439
see what Jesus said.

666
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:09,699
I'm going to jump right into the middle of a conversation that Jesus is having just to

667
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:13,819
look at one statement that He makes with regard to what we're speaking of here with

668
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:18,179
this truth of kind.

669
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:24,259
I'm not going to deal with the greater context, but I want you to see what Jesus says in Luke

670
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:28,379
6 and verse number 44.

671
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:41,079
In Luke 6 and verse 44, the Bible says this, "'For every tree is known by his own fruit.

672
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,019
For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of bramble bush gather they grapes.'"

673
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,939
Why?

674
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:53,099
Because God is a God of order.

675
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,259
He's a God of order.

676
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:02,179
And we find this morning that as we study the truth of creation, listen, creation reveals

677
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,179
a creator.

678
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:10,759
Psalm 19, "'The heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament showeth forth its handiwork.'"

679
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:14,899
Creation reveals a creator.

680
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:20,379
Everything that we have in this world, everything, every item that we have, somebody designed

681
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:21,939
it, somebody put it together.

682
00:38:21,939 --> 00:38:26,779
I have a watch on my wrist, it's because somebody made it.

683
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,699
It didn't just appear.

684
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:33,379
We didn't just put a whole bunch of components in a room and voila, set off some TNT and

685
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,539
there was a watch.

686
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:38,379
No, that's nonsense.

687
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:44,539
We're sitting in a building that's made up of materials that somebody with more knowledge

688
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:50,659
than I knew how to put all these materials together so that we could sit in a building.

689
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:56,839
You drove here, many of you, in a car that you probably don't even know all of the parts

690
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:02,379
that go together to make that car, save Ron, maybe somebody else, because Ron's built a

691
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:05,439
car before.

692
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:10,099
But you have all those components and then you got to put them all together.

693
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:13,139
And all you did this morning, well I didn't because I didn't drive here, I just walked

694
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,059
here, but all you did this morning is got in and either pushed an ignition button or

695
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:20,959
turned a key and it ran.

696
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,519
But somebody designed that.

697
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:34,639
So why is it that we would look at this creation and we would not conclude that there's a Creator?

698
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:40,259
Only if we want to deny the Creator because we don't want to be accountable to the Creator.

699
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:46,459
But I'm so thankful as a child of God that God's given me this book and He says, listen,

700
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:55,059
I want you to know that I'm the Creator God and that I have all power, that I am omnipotent.

701
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,579
That problem that you have, that difficulty that you're facing, and I'm not trying to

702
00:39:59,579 --> 00:39:59,979
act like...

703
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:01,579
like we don't have problems or difficulties,

704
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:03,799
I'm just simply saying God has all power.

705
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:06,939
That problem and that difficulty that you have,

706
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:10,139
you say, I have no idea how we're gonna deal with this.

707
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,219
He has all wisdom, He's omniscient, He knows.

708
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:19,059
He's great, and He has order.

709
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,379
He's a God of order.

710
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:25,299
Back in Psalm 33, and I'll conclude with this.

711
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,979
But I want you to see in Psalm 33,

712
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:30,579
these few verses that we've used

713
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,259
as a springboard this morning

714
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:34,899
into our text of Genesis chapter number one.

715
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,939
We find that the Bible told us in verse number six,

716
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:44,019
by the word of the Lord were the heavens made.

717
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:46,499
We read it, didn't we?

718
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:49,059
God said, and it was so.

719
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:54,719
Verse nine, for He spake, and it was done.

720
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:59,419
He commanded, and it stood fast.

721
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:03,339
But I want you to notice verse number eight.

722
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:06,719
I read it in the beginning, didn't spend much time on it.

723
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,439
In verse number eight, the Bible says this,

724
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:12,639
let all the earth fear the Lord.

725
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,439
Then notice this, let all the inhabitants of the world

726
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:22,119
stand in awe of Him.

727
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,519
Why am I gonna stand in awe of Him?

728
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,439
Because He's the creator.

729
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:30,559
When I look at the creation, I see His power,

730
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,199
and I see His wisdom, and I see that He's a God of order.

731
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,199
And I say, wow, what a God I serve.

732
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,799
He loves me, He's interested in me.

733
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:49,039
He knows my needs, He knows your needs.

734
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,839
And He created all of this, it's amazing.

735
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:59,079
This morning, the next few weeks,

736
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,559
we're gonna look at God's greatness

737
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,279
revealed through creation, but this morning we see

738
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:06,439
He spake, and it was done.

739
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:10,439
I hope this morning that we recognize

740
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:15,479
the greatness of His power, the greatness of His wisdom,

741
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,939
and that He is a God of order.

742
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:18,779
Let's pray together.

743
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,999
Father, we love you.

744
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,559
Oh, how we thank you for loving us.

745
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,559
Thank you for giving us the Bible, the record of creation.

746
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,359
Lord, we're so thankful that you are the creator.

747
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,519
But if you were only the creator and not the redeemer,

748
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,239
we'd be without hope.

749
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:42,319
I'm thankful that you are not only the creator,

750
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,379
you're the redeemer.

751
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:47,959
Before the events of Genesis chapter one with creation,

752
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:51,259
even before that in the eternity past,

753
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:56,699
you had a plan to redeem mankind.

754
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,199
The Bible tells us that Jesus is the lamb

755
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,699
that was slain before the foundation of the world.

756
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:05,779
And I'm so thankful for the plan of redemption.

757
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,139
God, we stand in awe of you of the creator,

758
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:12,619
but we are so very thankful that you're our redeemer.

759
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,619
This morning, if there's one that's not sure

760
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,959
of their salvation, they've never trusted Christ

761
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,479
as their personal savior,

762
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,519
I pray that you'd help them to recognize

763
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,639
the truth that we looked at,

764
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,799
but also this wonderful truth that you're the redeemer.

765
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:28,879
They would not leave this place.

766
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:30,319
They would not tune off of live stream

767
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,879
without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

768
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,559
God, I pray that as we recognize your greatness

769
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:43,559
through creation, you'd help us to stand in awe of you.

770
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,339
Help us to be encouraged and strengthened

771
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,539
to have our faith increase that you are the God

772
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:51,419
of all power, that you are omnipotent,

773
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,659
that you're the God of all knowledge,

774
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:57,419
that you're omniscient, that you are a God of order.

775
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:01,339
I pray that those truths this morning,

776
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,419
familiar truths for many of us,

777
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:06,219
Lord, but that those truths this morning

778
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:09,219
would have a profound impact in our lives

779
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,719
that we'd face each day, each circumstance.

780
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:20,999
My God is the creator and sustainer of all things.

781
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,599
How that will impact and change our perspective.

782
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:31,439
I pray that in these moments of invitation

783
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:33,419
that you'd have your will and way.

784
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:35,559
God, that as we've been ready to receive

785
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,219
and listen and attentively, Lord,

786
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,019
that you would help us to respond,

787
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,979
to be doers of the word, to allow the truth

788
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:46,859
to impact our lives.

789
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,819
Bless in these moments as only you can

790
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,579
and we'll thank you for it.

791
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:51,779
In Christ's name we pray.
