00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
33 this morning, Psalm 33,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.679
and hold your place here in Psalm 33.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.280
We'll be in Genesis chapter number one

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.920
quite a bit this morning as well,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.939
and so you might want to look at both of those places.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.300
Stick a bookmark or a ribbon there, a bulletin, something,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.600
and I'll be looking at this passage of Scripture.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.760
Trust it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.319
As you know, our theme for 2023 is Great is the Lord,

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.440
and I'm so thankful that our God is great,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.899
and as you know, I mentioned last week

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.159
that the message series,

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.280
the Sunday morning message series this year

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.860
will be designed so that it would help each of us

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.819
to recognize the greatness of God,

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.779
and then we will be challenged

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:42.680
to respond properly to his greatness,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.459
and as we go through on Sunday mornings

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:47.580
with this plan and this idea,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.900
for the next several weeks,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.939
I want to deal with this subject matter

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.099
and examine several messages

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:57.439
dealing with God's greatness revealed through creation.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:59.979
God's greatness revealed through creation.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.099
This morning, the message,

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:02.979
if you've looked on the back of the bulletin,

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:03.900
the title is this,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.139
He spake and it was done.

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:09.540
He spake and it was done.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300
In Psalm 33 and verse number six,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.239
the Bible says this,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.339
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made,

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.819
and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.860
He gathered the waters of the sea together as an heap.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.120
He layeth up the depth and storehouses.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.779
Let all the earth fear the Lord.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:37.319
Verse nine, for he spake and it was done.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.559
He commanded and it stood still.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:44.199
Our God is the creator of all things.

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:45.800
The Bible declares that to us,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.319
it reveals it to us.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.919
I've often said over the years

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:52.319
that the truth of creation is not isolated

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.879
to the book of Genesis.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.760
So often we go to the book of Genesis

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:56.860
and we will this morning

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.139
and we'll look at the first chapter of the book of Genesis

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.019
and we'll look at a number of verses of scripture

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:03.819
as God gives us the record of creation.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.819
We understand that as you study the word of God

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.300
that the truth of creation

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020
is not isolated to Genesis one and two.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.339
We find that as you study throughout the word of God

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.779
that various portions of scripture

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.559
throughout the whole of scripture

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.979
reveal to us that God is the creator

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.619
and it reveals to us the handiwork of our God

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.199
and that which is given to us,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.539
that which is revealed to us through creation.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.460
Many of God's people as you study the scriptures,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.539
they understood the greatness of God

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.360
as revealed through creation.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.759
They stood in awe even as we see here

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.619
in verse number eight of him

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.220
because he is the creator God.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.740
We see that Hezekiah and then later on the disciples,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.880
we see that Jeremiah mentions this as well

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.419
but you see that they pray

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.419
and they recognize that they're praying to the creator God.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.479
They're praying to the one that spoke

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.320
and it was done as we see in our text of scripture

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800
here this morning.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.779
We understand that God, our God is the creator God.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.320
That ought to increase our faith.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.940
That ought to encourage us as we go through life,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.800
as we deal with trials and difficulties

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.740
and we spoke of some of that this morning

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.899
in our Sunday school hour

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.679
as we examine some of what the disciples experienced

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.279
in the persecution there in Acts chapter number four

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.399
and we understand that we face difficulties

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.580
just as Hezekiah was facing the most powerful army

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.339
of that time, the Assyrians.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.380
They'd taken Israel captive

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.580
and they're there threatening to take Judah captive

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.580
but Hezekiah prays and recognizes that God is the creator

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
and as the creator, the Assyrian army is no trouble for him.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.940
Oh, Hezekiah could not defeat the Assyrian army

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.100
in his own power.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.699
There was nothing he could do

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:58.399
but God, the creator God was able to defend His people

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.080
and you read the account

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.259
and you see that He did in a miraculous way.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.080
God gives Jeremiah a promise.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.860
He gives him a command before He gives him the promise

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.080
and the command is to buy the field.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.440
It was very interesting as you study the book of Jeremiah

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.079
that Jeremiah is prophesying

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.880
on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.040
The children of Israel because of their disobedience

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.940
had already been taken captive by the Assyrians

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.339
as I mentioned a moment ago.

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:26.980
The Judah, the Southern tribes,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.339
those two tribes of the South,

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:32.820
they too followed in the wicked ways of Israel

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.160
and they too would face captivity.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.559
Their captivity, however,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.179
would be at the hands of the Babylonians.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:41.660
God would allow that and God was judging His people.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.059
We know that the Bible tells us

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.380
that it was going to be a 70-year captivity

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.100
and you read that and Jeremiah is prophesying

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.940
on the eve of that captivity.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.559
In fact, as he's prophesying,

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.600
you could see that the Babylonians were already ready

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.279
and they had besieged the city

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.559
and then God says, Jeremiah, buy this field.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.600
What an interesting piece of instruction

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.880
to buy a piece of field

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.440
when you know that the land is going to be taken

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.239
and you're going to be captives.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.880
And as Jeremiah prays in response to God's answer,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.880
he says, oh Lord God, thou hast made the heavens.

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.380
You begin to see how Jeremiah recognized

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.779
that the creator God was able to fulfill the promise

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.420
that he gave with regard to a remnant that would return

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.779
and indeed, the remnant returned.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.799
We read of that and we understand that historical truth

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:44.820
and this morning as we begin to as the people of God,

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.040
as we desire to see God and all of his greatness

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.040
and we start here with looking at how God's greatness

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.679
is revealed to us through creation

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:55.000
and we see that the psalmist says,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.260
for he spake and it was done.

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.239
What is it about God's greatness

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:03.600
that is revealed to us through creation?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.799
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:09.799
number one, creation reveals that our God is omnipotent.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.100
Creation reveals that our God is omnipotent.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.940
In other words, that he is great in power,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.859
that he has all power.

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:25.660
He said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.540
Jesus said that in Matthew 28.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.739
We read the book of Revelation,

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:32.899
the Bible says the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:35.279
We find that creation reveals to us

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.019
that our God is omnipotent.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.160
We find that there are many other truths

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.320
within the word of God and interactions

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.500
with the people of God where God reveals his great power

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.040
but no doubt creation reveals to us

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.480
the very power of God and that our God is omnipotent.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.880
Turn to the book of Genesis, if you will,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.920
in the first chapter and you find here

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.279
in the first chapter the record

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.600
that God gives us of creation

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.320
and as we note the statement of the psalmist

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.179
in Psalm 33, he spake and it was done,

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:06.040
we'll go through Genesis chapter number one

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.220
and we'll skip around some of the verses

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.420
and begin to see here this morning

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.019
how that God reveals to us

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.160
and you'll see this recurring statement

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.540
that God said and it was so.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.420
He spake and it was done.

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:24.380
In Genesis chapter number one,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.500
you see the first reference in verse number three

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.260
to God speaking, it says that and God said,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.019
notice what he said, let there be light

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:37.839
and there was light.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.559
The third verse of the Bible that is so precious

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:47.820
and powerful and profitable for us

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.320
tells us that God said, let there be light

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:56.720
and there was light, it's amazing.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720
The power of God Almighty as seen through creation.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.579
In verse number six, if you skip down to day two,

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:09.100
you find that the Bible begins in verse number six

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.179
by saying again, God said and in verse six and seven

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.899
records for us what he says, let there be a firmament

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:18.059
in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:20.059
from the waters and God made the firmament

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:22.579
and divided the waters which were under the firmament

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:25.019
from the waters which were above the firmament

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:27.380
and then notice the phrase at the end of verse number seven

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.899
and it was so.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.979
God said, we read everything that God said

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.799
and it was so, reveals to us the power of God.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.799
On day number three, beginning in verse number nine,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.719
the Bible says and God said, let the waters under the heaven

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:48.400
be gathered together unto one place

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.820
and let the dry land appear and again,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.119
you note those words and it was so.

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:57.280
And God called the dry land earth and the gathering

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.880
together the waters called he sees and God saw

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.059
that it was good and this is still the third day

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:04.859
on verse number 11, he speaks again, it says and God said,

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:07.940
let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.580
and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.799
whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so.

00:09:17.719 --> 00:09:19.979
The earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:22.200
after his kind and the tree yielding fruit

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.700
whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.380
that it was good and the evening and the morning

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.460
were the third day.

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:34.359
Verse number 14 reveals to us on day number four,

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:37.559
again, the same truth that God said and it was so,

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:40.359
let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven,

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:43.280
divide the day from the night, let them be for signs

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.000
and for seasons and for days and years,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.119
let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven

00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:51.760
to give light upon the earth and it was so.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.479
You understand this morning that we live in a time

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:58.219
in which, in fact, for many centuries now,

00:09:58.219 --> 00:09:59.940
the record of creation.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.460
has been attacked.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.960
I've often said in personal conversations and even from this pulpit publicly that the

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:15.280
attack on the Genesis record of creation is so just obvious in the day in which we're

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.020
leaving and they're constantly attacking the Genesis record.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020
Why?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.420
Because if they can destroy the foundation, everything else crumbles.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:35.900
If God cannot be trusted in Genesis 1, how can we trust God in John 3?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:42.900
If God cannot be trusted with regard to creation, how can God be trusted with regard to redemption?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.060
Do you see the attack of the enemy?

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.740
Do you see why he's so targeted on this thing of creation and we live in a day with all

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:58.220
sorts of theories and all sorts of ideas of where this world began, where we see the start

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.980
and all those types of things, but God says in the first page of the Word of God, he reveals

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.020
to us how he created and the power that is on display.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:15.100
On day number five in verse number 20, the Bible says this, and God said, we find again

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.860
in verse number 24, on day number six, and God said, we find again on day number six

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:29.860
in verse number 26, and God said, we find that God spoke and it was so.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:38.300
I'm so thankful that our God has that kind of power, amen?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:45.180
The theories that are out there that exist as to how this world began and how it all

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.959
started, they seek to remove God.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:55.220
And we understand why because Romans chapter 1 tells us that they want to deny the existence

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.100
of the Creator because really they don't want to be accountable to the Creator.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:07.660
But when we understand that God is the Creator and we are His creation, then we become accountable

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.220
to Him.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.220
And man, simply put, does not want to be accountable to God.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.779
So they want to deny the existence of God.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:24.699
They come up with their theories, as silly as they may be, and they try to peddle their

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:28.699
thinking and they've permeated our school systems.

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:31.860
They have permeated our society.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:37.300
But I'm here to tell you this morning that our God is the Creator God, and our God has

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.460
all power.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.100
And listen, when I understand and I begin to think about and have as our theme this

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:49.979
year that great is the Lord, and I think about His great power, I see it in creation.

00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:55.500
And I stand in awe of Him and I say that my God has that kind of power just as Hezekiah

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.900
prayed and just as Jeremiah prayed and just as the disciples prayed and just as you and

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:07.660
I have the opportunity to understand that the Creator God is my God, is our God, that

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.460
He has all power.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.100
He has great power.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.479
There's nothing in your life, there's nothing in my life that's too hard for Him.

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:25.540
He says to Abraham, He'd given a promise about a son, but we're old.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:32.619
Abraham and Sarah, we're old, we're past the time of childbearing.

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:39.820
God reveals Himself with the name of El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and He says to Abraham,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.820
is anything too hard for God?

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:50.740
This morning when we think about creation and we look at the first chapter of the Word

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:57.900
of God, we see that creation reveals to us that our God is omnipotent, that He has all

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.979
power.

00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:00.960
He is great in power.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.020
Not only does creation reveal to us that our God is omnipotent, but number two, creation

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.619
reveals to us that our God is omniscient, that He is great in wisdom, that He has all

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:13.380
knowledge.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.779
Keep your place here in Genesis 1, but turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will, in Isaiah

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:22.420
chapter 48, and we'll look at two verses of Scripture and I'll read them for you, but

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.100
I want to look at these two verses of Scripture and help us this morning to consider the wisdom

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.339
of God as seen through creation.

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:33.619
It reveals to us that our God is not only omnipotent, that He has all power, but our

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:38.220
God is omniscient, that He has all wisdom and all knowledge and He's great in power

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.080
and He's great in wisdom.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.779
And we find that as we look here at Isaiah 48 and verse 13, the Bible says, mine hand

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:51.959
also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:56.339
When I call unto them, they stand up together.

00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:59.899
Hebrews says something very similar in Hebrews 1 and verse number 10.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.459
I'll read the verse of Scripture for you, but in Hebrews 1 and verse number 10, the

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:09.220
Bible says, and thou, Lord, in the beginning hath laid the foundation of the earth, and

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.179
the heavens are the works of thine hands.

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:17.660
We see His power, but we see His wisdom.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.500
It's very interesting as you would consider creation and you would consider this morning

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.500
as we begin to understand the record that is provided to us here in the book of Genesis

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.299
with regard to creation.

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:33.380
We see that God has all power, but He has all wisdom, He has all knowledge.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.160
We consider this morning the stability of God's creation.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.220
The fact that God has created, but He's given stability in His creation.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.339
You think about all of the formulas that people use in mathematics and the sciences and all

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:52.019
of those things, why is it that they work?

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:58.739
Because God holds it all together, because He's given stability in His creation.

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:04.239
You think about gravity, you think about the tilt of the earth that's at 23 and a half

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:10.380
degrees and how that tilt of earth provides for us seasons, and why is it that we come

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.820
to certain times of the year and we say, well, the calendar's about to change, we're

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.299
gonna have this season and we're gonna go from winter to spring and spring to summer

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:24.179
and summer to winter and so on to fall and then to winter and you see the seasons and

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:29.339
we happen to live in a particular region of the world where we get all four seasons.

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:33.459
Some places they just get a couple of seasons because of where they're located on earth,

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:38.660
but we see that there's still that season that they will have, that they will experience.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.299
They say that we have two seasons, we have hot and hotter.

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:43.980
Some places of the earth are like that.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.019
We have wet, we have dry.

00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:47.019
They have seasons.

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:53.100
It's a result of the tilt of the earth, the stability of God's creation.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.540
You think about the magnetic field and all of these things and you begin to see how God

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.100
gave stability.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.899
Not only did God give stability, and this is because of His wisdom, because of His knowledge.

00:17:06.899 --> 00:17:11.420
He gave stability, but He also considered, if you would this morning, that God's creation

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.380
is suitable for life.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.660
We live in a time where they're spending billions of dollars to try to find life somewhere else.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:30.459
They're trying to find life somewhere else and then they deny what life really means

00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:32.500
here on this earth.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.140
And they don't value life.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.019
Isn't that amazing?

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:40.459
They don't value the one, they don't acknowledge the one who gives life.

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:46.339
But you begin to think about God making the earth, the creation, and where we are here

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:50.179
and understanding that He made earth suitable for life.

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:55.500
And the distance from earth to the sun is 93 million miles.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:03.179
You know, with just a slight variation, either closer or further away, earth could not support

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.779
life.

00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:12.459
The temperature differences and just some minor changes to that distance would not allow

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:15.059
for life on earth.

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:19.220
That's God's wisdom, it's God's knowledge.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.540
We find that earth's journey around the sun, I mentioned that it's 93 million miles from

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:30.860
earth to the sun, but the journey that we take annually around the sun is 584 million

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.860
miles.

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.539
Man, that's a long distance.

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:34.539
It is.

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:37.020
584 million miles.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.059
It takes 365 and a quarter days to do that and you can calculate it and it is consistent

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:47.260
to one thousandth of a second.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.260
It's amazing.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.299
But you know what's interesting?

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:58.979
If that journey around the sun took longer or took shorter, it would mess with life on

00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:00.880
earth.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.599
It would change the temperatures of earth and not allow for earth to support life.

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:10.159
Pastor, why are we dealing with this?

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:14.320
I didn't come to science class this morning because creation reveals to us that our God

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.460
has all wisdom, that He's great in wisdom and we stand in awe of Him.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.359
We think about the rotation of the earth, we understand, as I mentioned, a 584 million

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:31.099
mile journey around the sun, but then you understand that the earth is rotating every

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:37.200
day and we have this rotation that goes and we have night and morning and the day and

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.400
the evening, the sun and the moon and so on and so forth and changes to the rotation daily

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.440
would affect earth that there would be some places that would be colder and some places

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.400
that would be warmer and again, not allowing for life to exist in certain places.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.239
I want you to read a verse with me in the book of Job.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.799
In Job chapter number 9.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.339
Because when I begin to think about creation,

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:04.939
and I begin to think about the greatness of God,

00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:06.939
I'm thankful that God's creation

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:09.299
reveals to me his greatness.

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:12.159
I'm thankful that when I observe these things

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:15.459
about creation that I'm standing in awe of who he is,

00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:18.579
and I'm seeing that our God is great in power,

00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:21.699
that he is omnipotent, that he has all power.

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:24.459
I'm thankful that he is great in wisdom,

00:20:24.459 --> 00:20:27.739
that he's omniscient, that he has all knowledge.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:30.199
And we come to the book of Job in the ninth chapter.

00:20:30.199 --> 00:20:33.799
We find that Job is replying to a so-called friend.

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.259
They're miserable comforters.

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:37.499
They've come to him because of some experiences

00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:38.779
that have taken place.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.439
In chapter number one, you can read of them.

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.279
I mean, it's terrible what's happened in the life of Job,

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.759
but he retains his integrity.

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:47.679
He continues to serve God, and these men show up,

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.999
and they try to give him comfort,

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:50.959
and again, they're not very good comforters.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.979
But Job answers, and in his answer,

00:20:53.979 --> 00:20:56.319
he reveals to us something about the Lord

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.859
that is so precious.

00:20:57.859 --> 00:21:00.339
Notice in verse number four of Job nine,

00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:02.619
speaking of God, Job says this.

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:07.619
He, God, is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:15.979
I said that God's creation reveals that he's omnipotent,

00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:17.139
that he has all power.

00:21:17.139 --> 00:21:19.119
I said that God's creation reveals to us

00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:21.259
that he is omniscient, that he has all knowledge.

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:22.539
He's great in power.

00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:23.979
He's great in knowledge.

00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:28.399
And we see that these two truths are inseparable,

00:21:28.399 --> 00:21:31.359
and they're absolutely essential.

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:33.679
Isn't it wonderful to know that our God

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:38.579
knew exactly what to do, but then had the power to do it?

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:40.639
Think about that.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:45.719
You ever in a situation where you have the power

00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:48.039
to do something, but you don't have the knowledge

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:49.039
of how to do it?

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:51.479
House repairs.

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:52.939
Huh.

00:21:52.939 --> 00:21:54.579
I might have a certain amount of strength

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.219
to be able to do the work, but I have no knowledge

00:21:57.219 --> 00:21:59.019
of how to fix the problem.

00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:04.299
What about someone that has the knowledge

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:08.139
to fix the problem, but no longer has the power to do it?

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.419
When I first arrived here to pastor

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:16.259
Fellowship Baptist Church 11 1⁄2 years ago,

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:20.719
Miss Jackie Sundeen said something to me about Ed

00:22:20.719 --> 00:22:22.899
that made me laugh.

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:25.099
I still remember it.

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:26.859
She said this.

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:28.219
I was talking about sending an email,

00:22:28.219 --> 00:22:32.379
and she said, Mr. Ed, he could build you a house,

00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:33.939
but he can't click a mouse.

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.339
Ha ha.

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:36.379
That's what she said.

00:22:38.219 --> 00:22:41.559
Mr. Ed and technology, they don't go together.

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:46.279
But you know what Ed's told me in recent years?

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:47.699
Ed could build a house.

00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:50.719
He's wired lots of houses.

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:53.079
Super handy guy.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.039
You know what he says, pastor?

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:57.999
I just don't have the strength anymore.

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:01.439
I just can't do it anymore.

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:04.159
There's been some projects here at church

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:05.999
that I've called Ed, and I said,

00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:08.079
hey, Ed, would you help me with something?

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:09.839
He says, I don't think I have the power to do it.

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:11.239
I said, no, I don't need your strength.

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:12.379
I need your mind.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:16.879
Because I can do the work, I just don't know

00:23:16.879 --> 00:23:18.219
exactly what to do.

00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:21.619
So Ed, what I need you to do is I just need you

00:23:21.619 --> 00:23:23.499
to tell me step by step what to do,

00:23:23.499 --> 00:23:25.339
and then I'll do the physical part

00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:27.939
so that we can take care of this problem.

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:30.499
And we've accomplished a number of tasks that way.

00:23:31.659 --> 00:23:35.739
But with our God, he is, as Job said,

00:23:35.739 --> 00:23:40.699
wise in heart and mighty in strength.

00:23:40.699 --> 00:23:43.979
Not only did he know what to do with creation,

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:47.679
but he had the power to do it.

00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:49.719
And that's so exciting.

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.319
Because if he had the power to do it

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.519
but didn't know how to do it, it'd be chaos.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:56.119
And if he had the knowledge to do it

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:58.599
but not the power to do it, it'd never happen.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.599
But God has all power.

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:05.839
God has all wisdom.

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.519
He is great in power.

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:08.959
He is great in wisdom.

00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:11.319
Listen, that ought to encourage us this morning.

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.759
That ought to cause us this morning

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:15.459
as we think about this theme, great is the Lord,

00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:17.559
and we say, oh, our God, he is great.

00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:19.139
How do I know that he's great?

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:20.579
What is it that reveals to me?

00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:23.299
Because I want to recognize, I want to be aware

00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:24.579
of the fact that God is great.

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:28.940
Well, creation reveals his greatness.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.979
It reveals that he's omnipotent.

00:24:30.979 --> 00:24:32.839
It reveals that he's omniscient.

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:34.079
Let me say this.

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:38.859
Number three this morning, back in Genesis chapter number one,

00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:43.859
creation reveals that our God is a God of order.

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:51.599
Creation reveals that our God is a God of order.

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:55.739
I'm thankful that God is a God of order.

00:24:56.639 --> 00:24:58.119
It's not chaos with God.

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:00.899
There's no confusion with God.

00:25:03.199 --> 00:25:05.279
God says to us as his people,

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:06.919
it's recorded in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:10.440
let all things be done decently and in order.

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:13.619
And we find that our God is a God of order,

00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:17.659
and we see it in the very first chapter of the Bible,

00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:21.319
because creation reveals that he's omnipotent,

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:24.379
that he's omniscient, but that he's a God of order.

00:25:24.379 --> 00:25:27.019
Notice with me, think of this,

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:30.059
that there is logic in creation.

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:31.419
There's logic in creation.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:36.139
On day number two, we find that Genesis reveals to us

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:39.239
that God, he separated the sky.

00:25:39.239 --> 00:25:43.039
It says in verse number six, it says this,

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:45.399
let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:47.559
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:50.079
And God made the firmament and divided the waters

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:51.639
which were under the firmament from the waters

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:52.879
which were above the firmament,

00:25:52.879 --> 00:25:55.319
and it was so, and God called the firmament heaven,

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:57.479
and the evening and the morning were the second day.

00:25:57.479 --> 00:25:59.799
And we find that this was done on day number two,

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:01.759
but it was on day number five.

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:04.559
If you continue to read through the passage of scripture,

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.339
you come to day number five,

00:26:06.339 --> 00:26:08.500
and you find in verse number 21 that the Bible says,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.579
and God created great whales and every living creature

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:13.179
that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:14.139
after their kind.

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.220
But look at the end of verse number 21,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.500
and every winged fowl after his kind,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.139
and God saw that it was good.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:22.979
So on day number two, he separated,

00:26:22.979 --> 00:26:24.940
and he made the heaven the sky,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.500
and on day number five, he filled it with life.

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:29.859
He didn't make the fowls first,

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:31.739
and then figure out where to put them.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.039
On day number three, he formed the sea.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.419
The Bible says in verse number nine,

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:42.859
let the waters under the heaven be gathered together

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:45.139
under one place, and let the dry land appear,

00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:47.259
and it was so, and God called the dry land earth,

00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:49.899
and gathered, and the gathering together of the waters

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:52.519
called he seas, and God saw that it was good.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:54.619
So on day number three, God formed the sea,

00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:56.899
and we've already read verse number 21,

00:26:56.899 --> 00:26:59.959
that God, in verse number 20 says this,

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.819
and God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:04.879
the moving creature that hath life,

00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:06.799
and fowl that they may fly above the earth

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.199
in the open firmament of heaven,

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:11.359
and so God created the sea on day number three,

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.959
but then he filled it with life on day number five.

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:18.639
You know, how long do fish last out of water?

00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:21.799
Most of them not long, right?

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:23.959
If you're a fisherman, and I'm not,

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:26.919
but if you're a fisherman, if you're catching fish,

00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:30.000
not just wasting time, but you're catching fish,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.159
amen, Brother Sammy?

00:27:31.159 --> 00:27:33.539
And Brother Sammy's our resident fisherman,

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:36.099
and if you're gonna go fishing, you wanna catch,

00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:38.659
and not get a sunburn, and all that other nonsense,

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:43.339
you wanna catch fish, but if you're catching fish,

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:45.019
if you leave them out of the water too long,

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:47.459
they're gonna die, that's what fish do.

00:27:49.259 --> 00:27:51.220
God didn't create fish on day three,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.539
and then leave them out of water for two days.

00:27:54.459 --> 00:27:57.819
No, he created the sea on day three,

00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:01.759
and then on day number five, he filled it with life.

00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:03.659
Our God is a God of order.

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:06.079
Think about this, on day three,

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:08.979
we've already read the verse in verse number nine,

00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:11.279
where the Bible says that he formed the dry land,

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.039
and he called the dry land, he called it earth,

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:15.319
and the gathering together of the water,

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:17.119
in verse 10, he called seas.

00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:19.239
Notice what else he did on the third day,

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.359
in verse number 11, it says,

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:24.399
and God said, let the earth bring forth grass,

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:27.599
the herb yielding sea, and the fruit tree yielding fruit,

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:30.979
after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth,

00:28:30.979 --> 00:28:32.179
and it was so.

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:33.779
And it says this in verse number 12,

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:35.659
and the earth brought forth grass,

00:28:35.659 --> 00:28:37.700
and herb yielding seed after his kind,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.059
and the tree yielding fruit,

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:41.559
whose seed was in itself after his kind,

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:43.459
and God saw that it was good,

00:28:43.459 --> 00:28:45.339
in the evening, in the morning, or the third day.

00:28:45.339 --> 00:28:47.140
And so we find on day number three,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.419
not only did God form the dry land,

00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:53.979
but on day number three, he also brought forth vegetation.

00:28:53.979 --> 00:28:55.219
You know what that vegetation would be?

00:28:55.219 --> 00:28:57.260
It would be a source of food.

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:03.179
Because God knows that his creation needs sustenance.

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:07.099
And so he made the land, he made the vegetation,

00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:09.899
and then we come to day number six,

00:29:09.899 --> 00:29:12.219
and the Bible says this in verse number 24,

00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:14.880
and God said, let the earth bring forth

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.700
the living creature after his kind,

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.739
cattle and creeping thing,

00:29:18.739 --> 00:29:21.099
and beast of the earth after his kind,

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:22.459
and it was so.

00:29:22.459 --> 00:29:24.539
God made the beast of the earth after his kind,

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:25.739
and cattle after their kind,

00:29:25.739 --> 00:29:27.219
and everything that creepeth upon the earth

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.459
after his kind, and God saw that it was good.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.519
So God made the land animals after he made the land,

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:39.839
and after he made the food source.

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:44.000
Because our God is a God of order.

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:48.640
And we find that just reading Genesis chapter number one,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.640
answers so many questions that people are debating over

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.140
and fumbling over today.

00:29:57.219 --> 00:29:59.959
Professing themselves to be wise.

00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:04.039
But Romans 1 says they became fools.

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:05.039
Why?

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:08.759
Because they deny the Creator.

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:15.799
See our God created all things and there's order in His creation.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.599
Listen, there's logic.

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:21.639
It makes sense how God made, how God formed.

00:30:21.639 --> 00:30:23.899
Why was there logic to His creation?

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:25.719
Why is there order to His creation?

00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:29.039
Well because He's omnipotent and He's omniscient.

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:32.239
And thus you find that there's order in His creation.

00:30:32.239 --> 00:30:37.419
Not only do we see the logic in creation, but I believe this morning that you see longevity

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:38.679
of His creation.

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:44.259
In other words, I would say this, the ability to reproduce.

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.359
The ability to reproduce.

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:50.499
We find that as we study this first chapter of the book of Genesis that you will know

00:30:50.499 --> 00:30:51.499
a phrase.

00:30:51.499 --> 00:30:55.599
In fact, I've said it often already this morning.

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:59.439
There's the phrase God said and it was so, and we've mentioned that in our first thought

00:30:59.439 --> 00:31:00.719
and our first point.

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:05.119
But then there's this other phrase that is repeated here throughout the record of creation

00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:11.099
in Genesis 1, and it's this phrase, after His kind.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:12.759
After His kind.

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:15.399
This is so important.

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:22.279
This foundational, fundamental truth of God's Word is so very important.

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:27.079
We find that it was on day three in verses 12 and 13, and again we've read the verses,

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:30.559
but notice with me, because I want you to note the phrase where it says after His kind.

00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:32.219
Look in verse number 11 actually.

00:31:32.219 --> 00:31:36.679
It says, let the earth, and God said let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding

00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:43.799
seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit, notice, after His kind, whose seed is in itself upon

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:45.399
the earth and it was so.

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:48.599
Verse 12, and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed.

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:55.439
Notice again, after His kind, and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself, again

00:31:55.439 --> 00:32:02.319
a third time, after His kind, and God saw that it was good.

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:06.399
We see this on day number three.

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:10.199
We see this again on day number five in verse number 21.

00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:13.719
The Bible says this, and God created great whales and every living creature that moveth

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:16.399
which the waters brought forth abundantly.

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:25.199
Notice, after their kind, and every winged fowl, after His kind, and God saw that it

00:32:25.199 --> 00:32:26.199
was good.

00:32:26.199 --> 00:32:27.999
You say, pastor, why are you belaboring the point?

00:32:27.999 --> 00:32:31.439
Because we live in a confused world.

00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:40.479
They don't understand kind, but in the first chapter of God's Word, He reveals to us His

00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:46.439
power, He reveals to us His wisdom, and He reveals to us that He's a God of order.

00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:50.039
There's logic in creation, but there's longevity in creation.

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:53.639
There's this ability to reproduce, and we see the phrase, after His kind.

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:55.239
We see it again on day number six.

00:32:55.239 --> 00:33:00.079
It says in verse number 24, and God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature,

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:05.559
after His kind, cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, after His kind, and

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:06.559
it was so.

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:12.759
after His kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:15.479
after His kind, and God saw that it was good.

00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:17.639
You say, did He have to keep repeating it?

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:23.999
Yes, because He wants you to understand that there's order in creation, and God has made

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:27.679
it that way.

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:32.239
This is a critical truth, a critical truth.

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:36.479
The genetic code within the DNA, and some of you are much smarter than I am with regard

00:33:37.399 --> 00:33:42.439
to all of that, but it's my understanding, as I've done some studying, that the genetic

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:53.879
code within the DNA allows for a wide variation horizontally within kind, but no vertical

00:33:53.879 --> 00:33:59.399
evolution from one kind to another kind.

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:01.679
Does that make sense?

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:09.519
So within the genetic code, the Almighty God, the all-wise God, I could never figure this

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:15.319
out, you could never figure this out, but God Almighty, who has all power and all wisdom,

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:22.919
He created and He made after their kind, and He allowed within the genetic code for there

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:30.199
to be this variation horizontally within kind, but there would be no vertical evolution from

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.319
one kind to another kind.

00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:41.639
The horizontal variation that we see allows for adaptability, but not for evolution.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.479
It's very important for us to understand that.

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:47.919
Listen, they're trying to breed dogs today that really aren't dogs.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.999
They don't bark, they don't shed, right?

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:51.439
That's what dogs do, right?

00:34:51.439 --> 00:34:53.919
And they're trying to breed these dogs that don't do this.

00:34:53.919 --> 00:35:05.119
We have a golden retriever, and that golden retriever, he sheds, hallelujah.

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:08.639
I won't say any more.

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:13.879
It's my understanding that people that are in the dog breeding world, they're taking

00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:20.559
golden retrievers and they're trying to breed them with poodles because poodles don't shed

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:24.799
and they want to have a golden doodle.

00:35:24.799 --> 00:35:29.359
I'm not making this stuff up.

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:39.079
They are cute, I agree, but you understand that that's only possible because a golden

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:44.359
retriever and a poodle are of the same kind.

00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:49.799
They're dogs.

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:58.439
You're not taking a dog and you're not taking a cat and getting anything except a fight.

00:35:58.439 --> 00:36:00.079
Right?

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:06.599
Listen, I'm not a science major, I just read the Bible.

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:10.239
And I'm not trying to be, I don't want it to come across prideful or anything.

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:18.439
I'm just simply saying in the first chapter of God's Word, He reveals to us that He has

00:36:18.439 --> 00:36:27.599
all power, that He has all wisdom, and that He is a God of order.

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:31.699
In the first chapter of Genesis, you get all of that.

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:34.319
We haven't even gotten to the man part, when God creates man.

00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:38.159
We're going to deal with that next week because I don't have time in one message to deal with

00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:40.799
all of it.

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:46.639
But the reality this morning is that we see and we understand, listen, we understand this

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:52.279
practically, but we debate about it philosophically.

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:54.479
Why?

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:57.759
Because man does not want to acknowledge God.

00:36:57.759 --> 00:36:59.799
That's really the bottom line.

00:36:59.799 --> 00:37:04.439
Look at what Jesus said, I'll read it to you in Luke chapter number 6, and I want you to

00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:05.439
see what Jesus said.

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:09.699
I'm going to jump right into the middle of a conversation that Jesus is having just to

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:13.819
look at one statement that He makes with regard to what we're speaking of here with

00:37:13.819 --> 00:37:18.179
this truth of kind.

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:24.259
I'm not going to deal with the greater context, but I want you to see what Jesus says in Luke

00:37:24.259 --> 00:37:28.379
6 and verse number 44.

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:41.079
In Luke 6 and verse 44, the Bible says this, "'For every tree is known by his own fruit.

00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:47.019
For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of bramble bush gather they grapes.'"

00:37:47.019 --> 00:37:48.939
Why?

00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:53.099
Because God is a God of order.

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:55.259
He's a God of order.

00:37:55.259 --> 00:38:02.179
And we find this morning that as we study the truth of creation, listen, creation reveals

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.179
a creator.

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:10.759
Psalm 19, "'The heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament showeth forth its handiwork.'"

00:38:10.759 --> 00:38:14.899
Creation reveals a creator.

00:38:14.899 --> 00:38:20.379
Everything that we have in this world, everything, every item that we have, somebody designed

00:38:20.379 --> 00:38:21.939
it, somebody put it together.

00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:26.779
I have a watch on my wrist, it's because somebody made it.

00:38:26.779 --> 00:38:28.699
It didn't just appear.

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:33.379
We didn't just put a whole bunch of components in a room and voila, set off some TNT and

00:38:33.379 --> 00:38:34.539
there was a watch.

00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:38.379
No, that's nonsense.

00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:44.539
We're sitting in a building that's made up of materials that somebody with more knowledge

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:50.659
than I knew how to put all these materials together so that we could sit in a building.

00:38:50.659 --> 00:38:56.839
You drove here, many of you, in a car that you probably don't even know all of the parts

00:38:56.839 --> 00:39:02.379
that go together to make that car, save Ron, maybe somebody else, because Ron's built a

00:39:02.379 --> 00:39:05.439
car before.

00:39:05.439 --> 00:39:10.099
But you have all those components and then you got to put them all together.

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:13.139
And all you did this morning, well I didn't because I didn't drive here, I just walked

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:17.059
here, but all you did this morning is got in and either pushed an ignition button or

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:20.959
turned a key and it ran.

00:39:20.959 --> 00:39:23.519
But somebody designed that.

00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:34.639
So why is it that we would look at this creation and we would not conclude that there's a Creator?

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:40.259
Only if we want to deny the Creator because we don't want to be accountable to the Creator.

00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:46.459
But I'm so thankful as a child of God that God's given me this book and He says, listen,

00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:55.059
I want you to know that I'm the Creator God and that I have all power, that I am omnipotent.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:59.579
That problem that you have, that difficulty that you're facing, and I'm not trying to

00:39:59.579 --> 00:39:59.979
act like...

00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:01.579
like we don't have problems or difficulties,

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:03.799
I'm just simply saying God has all power.

00:40:04.879 --> 00:40:06.939
That problem and that difficulty that you have,

00:40:06.939 --> 00:40:10.139
you say, I have no idea how we're gonna deal with this.

00:40:10.139 --> 00:40:14.219
He has all wisdom, He's omniscient, He knows.

00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:19.059
He's great, and He has order.

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:20.379
He's a God of order.

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:25.299
Back in Psalm 33, and I'll conclude with this.

00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:28.979
But I want you to see in Psalm 33,

00:40:28.979 --> 00:40:30.579
these few verses that we've used

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:32.259
as a springboard this morning

00:40:32.259 --> 00:40:34.899
into our text of Genesis chapter number one.

00:40:36.099 --> 00:40:39.939
We find that the Bible told us in verse number six,

00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:44.019
by the word of the Lord were the heavens made.

00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:46.499
We read it, didn't we?

00:40:46.499 --> 00:40:49.059
God said, and it was so.

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:54.719
Verse nine, for He spake, and it was done.

00:40:55.559 --> 00:40:59.419
He commanded, and it stood fast.

00:41:00.479 --> 00:41:03.339
But I want you to notice verse number eight.

00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:06.719
I read it in the beginning, didn't spend much time on it.

00:41:06.719 --> 00:41:08.439
In verse number eight, the Bible says this,

00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:12.639
let all the earth fear the Lord.

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:17.439
Then notice this, let all the inhabitants of the world

00:41:17.439 --> 00:41:22.119
stand in awe of Him.

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:25.519
Why am I gonna stand in awe of Him?

00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:27.439
Because He's the creator.

00:41:27.439 --> 00:41:30.559
When I look at the creation, I see His power,

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:35.199
and I see His wisdom, and I see that He's a God of order.

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:40.199
And I say, wow, what a God I serve.

00:41:42.479 --> 00:41:45.799
He loves me, He's interested in me.

00:41:45.799 --> 00:41:49.039
He knows my needs, He knows your needs.

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:54.839
And He created all of this, it's amazing.

00:41:56.439 --> 00:41:59.079
This morning, the next few weeks,

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:00.559
we're gonna look at God's greatness

00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:03.279
revealed through creation, but this morning we see

00:42:03.279 --> 00:42:06.439
He spake, and it was done.

00:42:06.439 --> 00:42:10.439
I hope this morning that we recognize

00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:15.479
the greatness of His power, the greatness of His wisdom,

00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:17.939
and that He is a God of order.

00:42:17.939 --> 00:42:18.779
Let's pray together.

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:20.999
Father, we love you.

00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:23.559
Oh, how we thank you for loving us.

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:28.559
Thank you for giving us the Bible, the record of creation.

00:42:28.799 --> 00:42:31.359
Lord, we're so thankful that you are the creator.

00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:35.519
But if you were only the creator and not the redeemer,

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.239
we'd be without hope.

00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:42.319
I'm thankful that you are not only the creator,

00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:43.379
you're the redeemer.

00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:47.959
Before the events of Genesis chapter one with creation,

00:42:47.979 --> 00:42:51.259
even before that in the eternity past,

00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:56.699
you had a plan to redeem mankind.

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.199
The Bible tells us that Jesus is the lamb

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:01.699
that was slain before the foundation of the world.

00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:05.779
And I'm so thankful for the plan of redemption.

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:09.139
God, we stand in awe of you of the creator,

00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:12.619
but we are so very thankful that you're our redeemer.

00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:14.619
This morning, if there's one that's not sure

00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:17.959
of their salvation, they've never trusted Christ

00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:19.479
as their personal savior,

00:43:20.559 --> 00:43:23.519
I pray that you'd help them to recognize

00:43:23.519 --> 00:43:24.639
the truth that we looked at,

00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:27.799
but also this wonderful truth that you're the redeemer.

00:43:27.799 --> 00:43:28.879
They would not leave this place.

00:43:28.879 --> 00:43:30.319
They would not tune off of live stream

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:32.879
without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

00:43:34.559 --> 00:43:39.559
God, I pray that as we recognize your greatness

00:43:39.759 --> 00:43:43.559
through creation, you'd help us to stand in awe of you.

00:43:44.499 --> 00:43:46.339
Help us to be encouraged and strengthened

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:48.539
to have our faith increase that you are the God

00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:51.419
of all power, that you are omnipotent,

00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:53.659
that you're the God of all knowledge,

00:43:53.659 --> 00:43:57.419
that you're omniscient, that you are a God of order.

00:43:58.439 --> 00:44:01.339
I pray that those truths this morning,

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:04.419
familiar truths for many of us,

00:44:04.419 --> 00:44:06.219
Lord, but that those truths this morning

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:09.219
would have a profound impact in our lives

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:14.719
that we'd face each day, each circumstance.

00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:20.999
My God is the creator and sustainer of all things.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:27.599
How that will impact and change our perspective.

00:44:28.439 --> 00:44:31.439
I pray that in these moments of invitation

00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:33.419
that you'd have your will and way.

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.559
God, that as we've been ready to receive

00:44:35.579 --> 00:44:38.219
and listen and attentively, Lord,

00:44:38.219 --> 00:44:42.019
that you would help us to respond,

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:44.979
to be doers of the word, to allow the truth

00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:46.859
to impact our lives.

00:44:46.859 --> 00:44:48.819
Bless in these moments as only you can

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:50.579
and we'll thank you for it.

00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:51.779
In Christ's name we pray.
