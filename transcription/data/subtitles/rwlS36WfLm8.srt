1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
You see in the bulletin this morning that our message for the this morning title is

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,199
this, Elisha wept, Elisha wept.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:13,359
I am thankful that we serve the creator God, amen.

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,559
We have been created by God and we understand that he knows everything about us and he's

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,479
created us as emotional people.

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,440
And we understand that many of those emotions we could look at, we could speak about many

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,799
of those emotions this morning, but here with focus on the message, I would say this,

8
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:37,639
that at times our emotions are evidenced through our tears.

9
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:41,720
Sometimes that is tears of gladness and rejoicing.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,840
We find that Joseph, in fact, in the book of Genesis, there are many references in which

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,720
the Bible speaks about Joseph weeping.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,299
And you would find that he wept at the sight of his father.

13
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:57,220
After all of those years of being separated, and of course all that had transpired, and

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,060
those no doubt are tears of rejoicing.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,260
We find that we would look at the word of God and we often would refer to Jeremiah as

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,260
being what?

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,860
The weeping prophet.

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,660
That's oftentimes how we would refer to Jeremiah, as you read the book of Jeremiah, but especially

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,000
as you read the book of Lamentations.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,059
The book of Lamentations, God uses Jeremiah to write that book.

21
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:22,819
It's just a short book and we find that he's lamenting over the destruction of Judah because

22
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,500
of the captivity of the Babylonians and all that took place.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,959
And in Lamentations 1 in verse number 16 we read this, for these things I weep.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:40,900
For these things I weep, mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,260
that should relieve my soul is far from me.

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,860
My children are desolate because the enemy prevailed.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,819
We read also in Lamentations 3 in verse number 51 where the Bible says, mine eye affecteth

28
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,620
my heart.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,180
We think about that impact that our eye has upon our heart and then sometimes the impact

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,379
that our heart has on our eye through tears.

31
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:09,259
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ, at His triumphal entry, the Bible tells us that when

32
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,960
He seized Jerusalem, He wept over it.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,979
You read in the book of Acts in the 20th chapter as Paul is speaking to those religious, or

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,940
excuse me, to the leaders, the church leaders there at Ephesus, of the church at Ephesus.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,600
It's recorded in Acts 20.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,259
And as he's describing his ministry, he describes it this way, I cease not to warn everyone

37
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,860
night and day with tears, with tears.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,100
As we look at 2 Kings chapter number 8, we read, beginning in verse number 7, the Bible

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,500
says this, and Elisha came to Damascus and Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, was sick.

40
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,820
And it was told him, saying, The man of God has come hither.

41
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,940
And the king, that's Ben-Hadad, said unto Haziel, which was one of his servants, Take

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,460
a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him,

43
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,139
saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

44
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,520
No doubt Ben-Hadad was interested in knowing with this sickness that he had, am I going

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,820
to recover?

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,500
Am I going to get well?

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,759
And we find that Haziel goes to Elisha, the man of God, to meet him, and took a present

48
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,979
with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood

49
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:30,500
before him, and said, Thy son Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,899
I recover of this disease?

51
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:38,860
You see, in verse number 9, the description of the size of this present, and really the

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:45,259
scene is set for us, and Ben-Hadad had inquired through his servant Haziel, and Haziel comes

53
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,820
there and he speaks to Elisha, the man of God, and here's what Elisha's message is in

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,139
verse number 10.

55
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:59,660
He says, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover, howbeit the Lord hath showed me that

56
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,619
he shall surely die.

57
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:07,300
If you read the entirety of the passage of Scripture, you'll find that Ben-Hadad could

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,339
have recovered from the sickness that he had, but in fact what happened was Haziel

59
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,580
killed him.

60
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,339
If you read in verse number 15, it says, And it came to pass in the morrow, that he, Haziel,

61
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:24,640
took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died.

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,619
And notice what the last verse, or the end of that verse says, that Haziel reigned in

63
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,799
his stead.

64
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:36,660
In the midst of all of this, the verse by which we receive our title this morning in

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,779
the thought that I want to focus in this morning is in verse number 11.

66
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,540
The Bible says, after he had made the declaration, Elisha, to Haziel with regard to the fact

67
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,459
that he could recover, but that he would surely die, it says that he settled his countenance

68
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,420
steadfastly until he was ashamed.

69
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,059
Elisha looks for a lengthy period of time at Haziel, and the Bible says at the end of

70
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:07,779
verse number 11, And the man of God wept.

71
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,980
The man of God wept.

72
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,380
It's very interesting because in verse number 12, Haziel said, Why weepeth my Lord?

73
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,179
And I'm thankful for that question that Haziel asked because it's through that question that

74
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:30,940
we receive insight as to what it was that caused Elisha, the man of God, to weep.

75
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,179
If you're taking notes this morning, consider what Elisha recognized.

76
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:39,260
It's provided for us here in verses 12 and 13.

77
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,260
The scene is set.

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,500
We understand the interaction, the dialogue, as I've mentioned already, between Elisha

79
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,140
and Haziel with regard specifically to Ben-Hadad, but God had revealed something more to Elisha

80
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,380
than just the fact that Ben-Hadad would die.

81
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,459
In fact, God had revealed to Elisha that Haziel would reign, and not only would he reign as

82
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,420
king of Syria, but the destruction that would be brought upon the people of God.

83
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,179
And we find that in verse number 12, when Haziel looks back at Elisha and he sees that

84
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:15,500
Elisha, the man of God, is weeping, he says, Why weepest my Lord?

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,019
And he answered, here is the response of Elisha, the insight that we receive, and we find that

86
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:25,940
it's through this, what Elisha recognized that caused him to weep.

87
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,820
He answered, notice in verse number 12, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the

88
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,660
children of Israel.

89
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,140
He says, I know the evil, Haziel, that you're going to do to the children of Israel.

90
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,459
He says, notice what he says, how he describes it.

91
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:50,980
He says, Their strongholds wilt thou set on fire.

92
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:59,100
Their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children and rip up their

93
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,899
women with child.

94
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,540
Wow.

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,500
God had revealed this to Elisha, and as Elisha is standing there and answering the question

96
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,380
with regard to Ben-Hadad's health, God had not only revealed to Elisha that Haziel would

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,140
kill Ben-Hadad, but that Haziel would reign as the king, and the destruction that he would

98
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,739
bring upon his own people.

99
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:30,140
He says in verse number 13, And Haziel said, But what is thy servant, a dog, that he should

100
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
do this great thing?

101
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:38,059
And Elisha answered, The Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

102
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:40,980
I'm thankful this morning that our God is omniscient.

103
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,940
We spoke about that a little bit during our Sunday school hour this morning, and how that

104
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,100
the Lord knew their thoughts, those that were there seeking to attack and accuse the

105
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,540
Lord Jesus Christ.

106
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,579
But we find here that God is omniscient.

107
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,859
He's also eternal.

108
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,040
He knows the end from the beginning.

109
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,980
He is able to reveal to Elisha that which would happen in the future.

110
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,140
He was able to not only give Elisha wisdom and insight with regard to Ben-Hadad, but

111
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,420
also with regard to Haziel.

112
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,380
When we find that God had revealed this, Elisha makes it plain that it was the Lord.

113
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,739
This was not Elisha just coming up with some idea of what was going to happen.

114
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:29,380
The Lord God Almighty, the eternal Creator God, revealed this information to Elisha.

115
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:36,099
And it was this information, what Elisha had recognized about what Haziel would do that

116
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,219
brought him to a place of weeping.

117
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,659
It says that the man of God wept.

118
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:52,080
I want you to notice that this information that is given to us, that which Elisha had

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,739
recognized in verse 12 and 13, it comes to pass.

120
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:02,340
By the way, everything that God says comes to pass.

121
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,099
Sometimes you read in the New Testament that phraseology, and it came to pass.

122
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:12,260
You read how that the Lord has given us many promises for which we ought to rejoice and

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,700
be thankful for, and every one of them has either been fulfilled or will be fulfilled,

124
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,900
because God always does what He says He will do.

125
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:29,099
And we find that here in the depth of the destruction and the sorrow that Elisha has,

126
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:30,700
we find that it came to pass.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,820
Hold your place here in 2 Kings, but I want you to turn over to chapter 10 in verse number

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
32.

129
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,020
Turn over a few verses or a few pages and look here in 2 Kings chapter number 10.

130
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,419
In verse number 32, the Bible says, in those days, the Lord began to cut Israel short,

131
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,760
and Haziel smote them in all the coast of Israel from Jordan eastward, all the land

132
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,679
of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, the Manassites from Aurore, which is by the river

133
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,119
Arno.

134
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:08,319
on even Gilead and Bashan. We find that, obviously, because of the sin of the people, God is allowing

135
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:14,839
this judgment to take place. And the king of Syria, this Haziel, that is the man that

136
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:21,439
is interacting with Elisha in 2 Kings 8, we find here that he smote them and all the coast

137
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:26,299
of Israel, according to verse 32. Turn over another page or two to chapter 12, and notice

138
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:32,179
as we read here in this passage of Scripture and we notice what's taking place in verse

139
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:38,379
17. It says, Then Haziel, king of Syria, went up and fought against Gath and took it. And

140
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:45,299
Haziel set his face to go up to Jerusalem. And Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the hallowed

141
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:52,939
things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his father's kings of Judah, had dedicated,

142
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,379
and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house

143
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,739
of the Lord and in the king's house, and sent it to Haziel, king of Syria, and he went away

144
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:08,859
from Jerusalem. And so we find at this particular juncture, we find that Haziel had had success

145
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:14,299
there at Gath, and now he sets his army in the direction of going to Jerusalem for the

146
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,219
purpose of destroying it and overtaking it. And the king at that time is Jehoash, and

147
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:24,379
he takes all of the goods and he sends all of these goods to Haziel in order to appease

148
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,579
him so that he would not come upon Jerusalem. And at that particular time, the Bible tells

149
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:35,219
us that he went away from Jerusalem, but I want you to understand that that did not last,

150
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:39,859
for in chapter number 13, it says this in verse number 6, Nevertheless, they departed

151
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:44,339
not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein, and

152
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,459
there remained the grove also in Samaria. Neither did he leave of the people of Jehoahaz,

153
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:54,699
but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria had

154
00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:02,339
destroyed them and had made them like the dust by threshing." Who is that king of Syria?

155
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:09,739
It's Haziel. God tells us, as we read through the book of 2 Kings, that that which had been

156
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:17,179
revealed, that which was recognized by Elisha did indeed come to pass. We not only note

157
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:23,099
in our text of Scripture in 2 Kings chapter 8 how or what it was that Elisha recognized,

158
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:27,459
but we consider how he responded. We've already made note to this, and so I'll just quickly

159
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,819
rehearse it here, where the Bible says that the man of God wept. I want you to think about

160
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:37,339
that just for a moment. I want you to allow the thought of that text of Scripture to really

161
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,659
sink deep within your mind this morning and really to impress upon your heart the response

162
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,099
of Elisha to that which he had recognized. To weep is to cry, to shed tears, but the

163
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:54,339
reality is that often as we use that word weep or wept, it carries with it a greater

164
00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:01,259
context than just someone crying, someone that's just shed a single tear, just got a

165
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,619
little emotional or choked up in dealing with something. No, the Bible says that the man

166
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:18,059
of God wept. He wept. His heart was breaking over that which had been revealed to him.

167
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:27,059
And we find that that which had been revealed had a profound impact upon Elisha. The hardship,

168
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:35,259
the brutality, the destruction that would come to pass affected him. It impacted him.

169
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,259
And he stood there and wept. I don't know how long he stood there. The Bible tells us

170
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:44,619
in verse number 11 that he settled his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed. There was

171
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:49,860
a period of time that Elisha stood there staring at Hazio. You ever feel like somebody's staring

172
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,580
at you and they're just kind of looking into your soul, so to speak? They're standing there

173
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:02,179
and he begins to weep. He begins to weep. You ever been in a situation where someone's

174
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:08,019
crying and you've asked them, they're weeping, and you say, why are you weeping? That's what

175
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:17,380
happens in verse 12. Why weepeth my Lord? And he gives the answer. We've looked at it

176
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,419
already. But when we consider this morning, this text of Scripture from the Old Testament,

177
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:27,100
and we consider what Elisha recognized and how he responded, I want you to consider this

178
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,419
morning with me. I'm not going to preach short this morning. I'm just getting to the third

179
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,660
point. That's our longest point. I want you to consider this morning, number three, the

180
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:44,660
absence of tears. The absence of tears. I want you to think about this. Turn over to

181
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,820
the book of Isaiah, if you will, in the 39th chapter. Isaiah chapter 39. I want you to

182
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,139
look at this passage of Scripture with me. We won't take time to read all of it, but

183
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,619
I want you to understand what's taking place here. In this passage of Scripture, we read

184
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:08,260
about Hezekiah and his interaction with the man of God, the prophet of God, Isaiah. We

185
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,419
find that Hezekiah, we often would say that he would find himself in that category as

186
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:19,019
being basically a good king. And you read about Hezekiah. Remember, it was during his

187
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,500
time that the Assyrians were going to come and to try to take captive Judah. They had

188
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,579
already been successful in taking captive Israel, the ten tribes of the north. We find

189
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:35,579
that Hezekiah, he receives those letters and he receives all that's taking place. The threats

190
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:43,139
and just the crazy stuff that was being said to him with regard to how they would be destroyed.

191
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,859
The people that come from Assyria, they not only try to pressure upon Hezekiah and to

192
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:56,859
cause Hezekiah to fold, but they try to impact the people. They try to cause the people to

193
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,399
be afraid. They tell the people, don't trust in Hezekiah. Don't allow him to influence

194
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,660
you to trust in God. We are mindful of the fact that Hezekiah takes those papers and

195
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,339
he opens them up to the Lord and he prays to God. He understands that God is the Creator

196
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,139
and that God is able. And let me say this, God moves and God works miraculously. And

197
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:26,139
the Assyrians are destroyed, but then Hezekiah gets sick. And we read in the beginning of

198
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:32,220
chapter 38 where the Bible says, in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And he

199
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,419
is told this by the prophet at the end of verse number 1 of Isaiah 38, thus saith the

200
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:44,419
Lord, set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live. And Hezekiah is saddened

201
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,940
at this news and Hezekiah begins to pray and God hears the prayer and God says that He

202
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:57,940
would add 15 years to his life. The worst 15 years of his life. Honestly. Terrible.

203
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:07,859
And here is what happens. The Babylonians send a group of people and Hezekiah welcomes

204
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:15,859
them. And Hezekiah shows them all that he has and all that is there. And after the meeting

205
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,299
with the Babylonians, we pick it up in chapter number 39 and it says this in verse 2, and

206
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,220
Hezekiah was glad of them. That's the entourage, if you will, that was sent from the king of

207
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,899
Babylon according to verse number 1. They had heard that he had been sick and he recovered

208
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,820
so they come and they had a present and he said that he was glad and he showed them the

209
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,699
house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment

210
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:44,899
and all the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing

211
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:51,899
in his house and all his dominion that Hezekiah showed them not. Then Isaiah came. Isaiah

212
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,260
came and paid Hezekiah a visit in verse number 3 and it says that Isaiah says unto Hezekiah,

213
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,339
what said these men and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, they are come

214
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,739
from a far country unto me, even from Babylon. Then said he, what have they seen in thine

215
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:14,179
house? And Hezekiah answered, all that is in mine house have they seen. There is nothing

216
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:19,820
among my treasures that I have not showed them. In verse number 4. In verse number 5

217
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,820
the Bible says then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, hear the word of the Lord of hosts. Behold,

218
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:34,820
verse 6, the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have

219
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:44,339
laid up in store until this day shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, saith the

220
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:52,099
Lord. And of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take

221
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:58,140
away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Now verse 6 and 7

222
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,140
is not good news. Right? Verse 6 and 7 we could liken that to what Elisha understood

223
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:10,460
in 2 Kings chapter number 8. How that he understood what Hazael was going to do, the king of Syria

224
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,380
to the people of God and the brutality and the destruction, the way in which God reveals

225
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,659
to him that the strongholds would be burned, the young men would be slain, the children

226
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,299
would be dashed and they would rip up the women with child and God revealed that to

227
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:30,659
him and here Hezekiah the king of Judah is given this revelation, he's given this information

228
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:36,700
from Hezekiah that listen, excuse me, Hezekiah receives it from Isaiah that everything that

229
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,260
they've seen is going to be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left and by the way your

230
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,260
sons that shall issue from you, they're going to become eunuchs in the palace of Babylon.

231
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Notice Hezekiah's response in verse number 8. Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, good is the

232
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,380
word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, good is the word of the Lord

233
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,620
over, for there shall be peace and truth in my days."

234
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,860
Does that not bother you?

235
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,940
The response of Hezekiah is not to weep.

236
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,420
The response of Hezekiah is not to beg God to intercede.

237
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,900
Oh, when he was told that he was going to die in Isaiah chapter 38, in verse number

238
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:38,220
four, and let me back up, in verse number three, and said, remember now, oh Lord, he's

239
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,340
coming and he's praying to the Lord.

240
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,740
According to verse number two, he turned his face to the wall and he prayed unto the Lord

241
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,740
and he says this, in verse number three, remember now, oh Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked

242
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,820
before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight.

243
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,940
And Hezekiah wept sore because he was going to die.

244
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,500
God says in verse number three, verse number four, excuse me, then came the word of the

245
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Lord unto Isaiah saying, go and show to Hezekiah, say to Hezekiah, thus saith the Lord the God

246
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,940
of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, notice this, I have seen thy tears, behold,

247
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,700
I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

248
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:25,100
But in chapter 39, the Babylonians are going to come and they're going to take everything.

249
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,980
Nothing is going to be left.

250
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,700
Their sons are going to become eunuchs in the palace of Babylon.

251
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,020
And Hezekiah says, good is the word of the Lord, there'll be peace in my day.

252
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,780
Does that not baffle your mind?

253
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:47,460
The absence of tears on the part of Hezekiah.

254
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,180
If we'd be honest this morning, I make the application for us today.

255
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,700
I believe in many of our lives, in many of our churches across this land, in fact in

256
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:06,340
many of our churches across this globe, I believe there's an absence of tears.

257
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:16,100
There's an absence of allowing the truth that God has revealed to us to truly impact us.

258
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,900
The reality is that Elisha hears about physical destruction that's going to take place at

259
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
the hands of Hazael, king of Syria.

260
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,779
The man of God wept.

261
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:38,100
What was it that caused Hezekiah to weep his own death being announced?

262
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,460
But at the destruction of the people and the carrying away into captivity, he wept not.

263
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,779
This morning, I think about what God's word has revealed to us as the people of God today,

264
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,419
just as God had revealed through the prophets and to Elisha the prophet, and then through

265
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,620
the prophet Isaiah to Hezekiah, He had revealed to those men what would happen, what would

266
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,540
come to pass.

267
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,419
Can I tell you this morning that God has given us truth with regard to what's going to come

268
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,580
to pass.

269
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,300
As we look to the word of God, and I think this morning specifically about the truth

270
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:28,139
of the reality of the lake of fire.

271
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:33,740
The word of God refers to it as the second death, the great white throne judgment.

272
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,540
This morning, the truth is that that will come to pass, and every single lost person

273
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,820
that you know and every single lost person that I know is going to stand at the great

274
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,300
white throne.

275
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,779
Look at it in Revelation 20.

276
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,300
I'll be honest with you, I hate reading this passage of Scripture publicly, but I'm going

277
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,419
to.

278
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:12,900
I don't much enjoy reading it privately.

279
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:22,300
In Revelation 20 and verse number 11, the Bible begins by saying this, and I saw a great

280
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:29,980
white throne, and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away,

281
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,339
and there was found no place for them.

282
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:39,820
I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened and another

283
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,779
book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things

284
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:50,100
which were written in the books according to their works, and the sea gave up the dead

285
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,380
which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were

286
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,140
judged every man according to their works.

287
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,540
And death and hell were cast in the lake of fire, this is the second death, and whosoever

288
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:15,140
was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

289
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,860
Now often this morning as we think about this truth, for ourselves maybe we think about

290
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,339
verse number 6 of Revelation 20, but the Bible says, blessed and holy is he that hath part

291
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:33,179
in the first resurrection, on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests

292
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,899
of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.

293
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:41,100
I'm thankful this morning that I've been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ, and I'm

294
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,399
thankful this morning that the second death has no power over me, but there are countless

295
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:55,700
millions of people that do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

296
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:02,380
Some of the people that you work with, some of the people that you live next to, some

297
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,020
of the people that we see throughout the community.

298
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,660
The reality is that one day, we don't know the day, we know that the great white throne

299
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,580
judgment is at least a thousand and seven years away because of the tribulation and

300
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,660
the millennial reign of Christ, but that is if the Lord returned at this moment.

301
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:31,500
So we don't know how long it is until this event takes place, but we know that just as

302
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,660
the case was with Hazael, it came to pass.

303
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,140
Just as the case is with the Babylonians, you can read of the Babylonian captivity and

304
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,760
all that they did in the destruction of Judah and the carrying away of the people.

305
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,739
You can understand this morning that this too, this truth of Revelation 20 is going

306
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,739
to come to pass.

307
00:26:54,739 --> 00:27:00,059
And I want you to think about this as you go into the 21st chapter of the book of Revelation.

308
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,459
I'm not going to read much except for one verse here in verse number four, and I just

309
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:07,220
want to read really the first part of the verse because I want you to see what the Bible

310
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
says.

311
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:16,059
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

312
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,020
Continues and says, there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither

313
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,940
shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.

314
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,480
I want you to think about that first phrase in verse number four where it says, God shall

315
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,940
wipe away all tears from their eyes.

316
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,660
I believe that as you look at the text of Scripture and you understand the events that

317
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,500
are taking place, I believe that believers will be at the great white throne of judgment

318
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,020
not to be judged, but will be there.

319
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,860
And why is it that Revelation 21 and verse number four says that God shall wipe away

320
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,739
all the tears?

321
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:56,820
Because I think there's going to be a lot of believers that are going to be weeping.

322
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,459
The issue is that we ought to be weeping right now.

323
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:04,739
I wonder as we look at our prayer bulletin, when's the last time we've wept over some

324
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:10,459
of the names in that prayer bulletin, people that are lost that we know.

325
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:15,880
We have specific names on our prayer bulletin because they're specific people that we know.

326
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,459
Maybe not every single one of us know them personally, but somebody within our congregation

327
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:22,420
knows them personally and we pray for them.

328
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,660
I want you to think about this truth as we...I've asked myself this question, how can we have

329
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,580
dry eyes?

330
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,619
How can we respond like Hezekiah did and say, well, it's good for us?

331
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,520
Sometimes we get this perspective of life and maybe we just get so consumed with what's

332
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,500
going on and the routine and the monotony of life and just all that's taking place,

333
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,820
and we're not even mindful of the fact that these people are going to die and go to a

334
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Christless eternity.

335
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,419
They're going to be cast into the lake of fire forever, it's not just for a period of

336
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,220
time, it's for all of eternity.

337
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:10,299
And how can we that know the truth not really be impacted by it?

338
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,739
Should it not cause us as it caused Elisha to weep?

339
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:22,380
I want you to notice the testimony of the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans.

340
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:30,619
Paul, of course, I mentioned already in Acts 20 by way of introduction, how that he speaks

341
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,940
about his ministry there in Ephesus and he's speaking to the church leaders of Ephesus

342
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,320
and he says that, I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

343
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,960
Why did Paul cease not to warn night and day?

344
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,280
And why did he have tears?

345
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,520
Because God had revealed some things to him.

346
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,919
God had revealed to him the truth of salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

347
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:02,000
Listen, there's no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved, right?

348
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,359
Neither is there salvation in any other name.

349
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,679
other name, the name of Jesus.

350
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,199
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

351
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:11,319
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

352
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:17,319
In Romans 9, I want you to see the heart, if you will, of Paul as he's sharing here

353
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,919
and speaking about his own perspective.

354
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,959
He says, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness

355
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,679
in the Holy Ghost.

356
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,639
We know that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and we understand that God is recording

357
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:37,879
this, and these are the thoughts, this is the heart of Paul as he's sharing with these

358
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:38,879
believers.

359
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:45,499
And he's saying, I'm telling you the truth, I'm not just trying to sound good here.

360
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:52,199
He says that I have, notice what he says in verse number 2, I have great heaviness and

361
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:57,519
continual sorrow in my heart.

362
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,139
Why Paul?

363
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:05,779
I know that the word weep or tears is not mentioned there, but in my mind this morning,

364
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,419
I think that this man that has great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart, I believe

365
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:14,099
there were tears that were shed.

366
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:19,439
As he said to the believers at Ephesus, I cease not to warn night and day with tears,

367
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:22,339
no doubt he's got tears.

368
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:28,139
And it tells us in verse number 3, for I could wish that myself were accursed from

369
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:34,979
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.

370
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:42,319
Chapter 10 in verse number 1, notice what he says, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer

371
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:49,579
to God for Israel is that they might be saved.

372
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:53,299
Paul's desire was for people to be saved.

373
00:31:53,299 --> 00:32:00,539
He has, he's called, he's known as the apostle to the Gentiles, right, to the uncircumcision.

374
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:05,819
We understand that, he mentions that in the book of Galatians, but he himself is Jewish.

375
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:11,419
And being Jewish, he says, I have this great sorrow and this continual sorrow, this heaviness

376
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:12,419
in my heart.

377
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,419
Why?

378
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,859
Because I want them to be saved.

379
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:22,019
Because I know that just because they're Jewish doesn't mean they're right with God.

380
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,059
Just because they have that heritage, just because that's their lineage, that does not

381
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,619
give them a free pass.

382
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:33,459
By the way, there are some people today that preach heresy on that subject, and they say

383
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:36,859
just because someone's Jewish means they're going to go to heaven.

384
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,779
That is an error, that is not true.

385
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,619
The gospel, Paul says, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, it is the power of God

386
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:51,579
unto salvation, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile or to the Greek.

387
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:52,579
Notice the distinction.

388
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:56,659
He's talking about how Jesus came to his own and his own received him not.

389
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:00,499
How many times in Paul's ministry did he go and he went to the synagogue preaching to

390
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:05,419
the Jews, but the Jews didn't want to hear it, so he goes to the Gentiles.

391
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,739
Over and over, you read in the book of Acts.

392
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:16,819
And so Paul is sharing his heart here for his kinsmen according to the flesh.

393
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:19,279
Notice the depth of the heartache.

394
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,599
He says that I have great heaviness in chapter 9 and verse number 2, continual sorrow in

395
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,839
my heart.

396
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,639
Notice what he says, I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren,

397
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,639
my kinsmen, according to the flesh.

398
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:40,719
I cannot fully comprehend the depth of verse number 3, I can't.

399
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:45,719
I can't comprehend the depth of saying that I could wish that myself were accursed from

400
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:49,079
Christ so that somebody else would be saved.

401
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,639
Paul had a great desire to see people saved.

402
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,639
What caused Paul to continue to go and preach the gospel?

403
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:00,999
He'd go and he'd be beaten and he'd be cast out of town and suffer all sorts of persecution,

404
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:06,119
but he'd go to the next place and he'd preach some more because he understood the truth

405
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,399
of the gospel.

406
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,079
He understood the need for people to be saved.

407
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,599
He said, I'm willing to endure some hardship, I'm willing to endure some opposition, I'm

408
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,919
willing to suffer some loss because my focus is on eternity.

409
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,279
And these people, they need Christ.

410
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:33,639
This morning as we think about the absence of tears, I've mentioned it by using the illustration

411
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,599
of Hezekiah, but I challenge ourselves to look at our own lives.

412
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,759
When's the last time we wept over lost souls?

413
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:50,000
When's the last time we wept over our country, our nation, the globe?

414
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,239
Millions are dying.

415
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,599
Many times they die without Christ.

416
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,000
I understand that we can't make anyone get saved.

417
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,319
We can't make anyone get saved.

418
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:09,519
In fact, if we can force conversion, I would question if it's actually conversion, right?

419
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,679
Because it's a choice.

420
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,959
So we can't force anyone, we can't manipulate anyone to trust Christ.

421
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:26,279
But can I tell you this morning that as we look at the life of Hezekiah and we think

422
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:33,000
about that absence of tears in contrast to the life of Elisha and the weeping over what

423
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,159
would take place, I want my life to align more with Elisha than with Hezekiah.

424
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,039
I don't want my own difficulties.

425
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:53,399
I don't want news of my own health scare to cause me to weep when I won't even weep over

426
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,399
lost souls.

427
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:57,779
Does that make sense this morning?

428
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:04,899
But sometimes we get so self-centered and so self-focused that it's just all about what's

429
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:08,539
going on in my life, in my circle.

430
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,939
We need to kind of break that down and begin to look and see what's going to happen.

431
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:19,579
Turn over to the book of Psalms, if you will, and we'll close with this passage of Scripture.

432
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:49,099
Psalm 126.

433
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:56,659
I want you to notice what the Bible says in verses 5 and 6.

434
00:36:56,659 --> 00:37:05,619
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

435
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:16,699
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,

436
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:20,659
bringing his sheaves with him.

437
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:27,699
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

438
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,339
I don't remember what year it was.

439
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:34,299
I was just doing a quick search here on my iPad when you were turning to that passage

440
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,779
of Scripture.

441
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:43,379
God gave me this poem that I wrote for one of our missions conferences a few years ago.

442
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:47,500
I don't remember the date, but I titled the poem, and I'm not a poet, by the way.

443
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,219
This is the only poem I've ever written.

444
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:53,019
We've got some people in our church that have written poems and they could write books of

445
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:56,899
poems.

446
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,899
Have I done my part was what I titled the poem.

447
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:05,979
Their names upon my heart, I wonder, have I done my part?

448
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,779
Their faces I can see.

449
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:11,259
They will live eternally.

450
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:18,059
For billions have never heard the message from God's Word, how He died upon the tree

451
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,379
and rose in triumph on day three.

452
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:30,699
For boldness let us pray as we tell them of the way, the promise we must claim as the

453
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,339
gospel we proclaim.

454
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:40,419
And I'd add in that the need to weep.

455
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:45,700
I pray that God would give us tears, seriously.

456
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:54,859
Not to just be some weepy person that's always crying, but to truly have that heart of compassion

457
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,579
for lost souls.

458
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:02,619
Listen, I don't want somebody to just think, you're trying to tell me this because you

459
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:05,619
want me to go to your church.

460
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:10,859
I've told people, I don't care if you ever come to our church.

461
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:15,339
I'm most concerned about where you're going to spend eternity.

462
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:18,419
Would I like to see them come to a church that teaches and preaches the Word of God

463
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:22,380
where they can grow and learn to walk with Christ?

464
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,820
Absolutely.

465
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,619
But most importantly, I'm concerned about their salvation.

466
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:33,099
You know, there's a lot of people today that have the perspective when we invite them to

467
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,539
church that they just want us to go to church because we want numbers, or maybe because

468
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:38,820
we're after their purse.

469
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,820
We want their money.

470
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,019
But no, I don't want your money.

471
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:49,839
I want to tell you what God did for me and what He could do for you.

472
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,739
And I believe this morning that if some...

473
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,619
I don't want to be a professional Christian, can I use that term this morning?

474
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:02,979
I don't want to just have a Roman's Road memorized that I just kind of wrote memorization.

475
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:03,479
You know what that is?

476
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,419
it is, right?

477
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,099
Kids in school say the alphabet.

478
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:09,019
Kids in school say this, say that.

479
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,139
In some religious organizations, they have catechisms and they ask a question, and it's

480
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:17,419
just rote religion, just rote responses.

481
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,659
I don't want to be a rote Christian.

482
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:23,259
I don't want to just go knock on somebody's door, talk to somebody at the coffee shop,

483
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:27,699
interact with somebody at lunch, and just kind of feel like I'm a professional Christian.

484
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:33,259
I want them to see that there's a heart of compassion, because I understand that one

485
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:41,579
day they will stand before God Almighty and should cause us to weep.

486
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:47,539
And perhaps this morning we just need to pray that God would give us some tears.

487
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:55,879
God help us to identify more with Elisha than with Hezekiah, because when God revealed to

488
00:40:55,879 --> 00:41:01,339
Elisha what Hazael was going to do, the man of God wept.

489
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:07,919
He wept about some physical destruction.

490
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:13,879
The death of those people is no doubt a sad thing, but I would argue this morning that

491
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:18,259
we're dealing with something on an entirely different plane, because we're not just dealing

492
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:24,279
with physical death, we're dealing with spiritual death.

493
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:31,719
Someone wrote a song a number of years ago, Lord, let us weep again.

494
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:35,379
It's a powerful truth, and I just pray that God would help us.

495
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:38,919
As Elisha wept, that we'd have a renewed focus.

496
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,739
Why are we really here?

497
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,959
Why did Hezekiah really get 15 more years?

498
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:48,639
Was it just so that he could have peace and safety and have a good life?

499
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:53,099
Unfortunately, he just messed up in those 15 years.

500
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,699
Sad.

501
00:41:55,699 --> 00:42:02,859
His son that would follow him on the throne was born in those 15 years, who was wicked.

502
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,999
This morning, Elisha wept.

503
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:08,539
Oh, that God would help us to weep again.

504
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:09,539
Let's pray.

505
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:13,399
Father, we love You this morning.

506
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:18,039
We thank You for loving us.

507
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:28,879
God, we thank You for salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

508
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:34,359
I could speak for myself and for many that are gathered here this morning that we've

509
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:39,359
placed our faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

510
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,759
We have confidence that when we take our final breath here upon this earth that we'll

511
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:52,699
be immediately in Your presence, not because of any good works that we've done, not because

512
00:42:52,699 --> 00:43:05,519
of any merit of our own, but because Calvary covers it all.

513
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,719
There's one here this morning on our property, one that's tuned in via live stream that's

514
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,079
not sure of heaven.

515
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,839
God, I pray that today they'd get it settled.

516
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,419
I pray that You'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show somebody how they could

517
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:24,159
know for sure that heaven is their home, not hoping, not thinking, but knowing with certainty,

518
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:29,999
with 100% confidence that heaven is their home.

519
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:37,439
God, I pray for those of us that are here that are saved.

520
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:42,839
God, You've revealed things to us just as You revealed to Elisha and just as You revealed

521
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,099
to Hezekiah.

522
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:51,279
That which You've revealed to us is going to come to pass.

523
00:43:51,279 --> 00:44:00,599
God, I pray that You'd help us to go onward and forward as we sang this morning how thankful

524
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,599
we are that we have Your own promise.

525
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,759
You said that You would build Your church and that the gates of hell shall not prevail

526
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:12,599
against it.

527
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,999
I'm thankful that as we go onward and forward that we go with the message that Calvary covers

528
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,559
it all.

529
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:26,159
God, I just pray this morning that You'd help us to do it with tears, not to just be weepy

530
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:40,319
people, but God, to have a heart of compassion for those that we know have not yet trusted

531
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,919
Christ as their Savior.

532
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:52,599
The names in our prayer list, the last time we wept over them, God, would You help us

533
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:53,599
to weep again?

534
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:02,759
I pray that You'd move in a way this morning that would not just have a temporary change

535
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:04,959
or impact in our lives.

536
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:12,719
God, I pray that You'd just renew in us, we sing that song of passion for souls.

537
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,679
Help us to have a passion with compassion.

538
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:20,959
We give You the honor and glory for every decision that is made.

539
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:24,999
We pray that You'd move as only You can, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

540
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:25,999
Would You stand with me?

541
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:29,199
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

542
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,319
We end each service with an invitation.

543
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,639
The purpose is to give you an opportunity to respond to how the Holy Spirit has used

544
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,239
His Word in your life.

545
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,679
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.
