1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
on Wednesday evenings through the summer.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,079
Of course, my dad has been teaching through Psalm 23.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,600
And what a great study that has been.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,279
I know that I have enjoyed it.

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,880
I trust that many of you as have as well.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,139
And every other week, Brother Mark and I are switching back and forth

7
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,620
with the teen class.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,879
And so I did a little series this summer with the teens.

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,379
This is actually only the third lesson,

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,860
but it was the lesson I was going to teach this evening.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,360
I figured I'd go ahead and just preach it, teach it for you this evening

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,400
and trust it will be a blessing to you.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,060
And notice with me in First Samuel, chapter number 16, beginning in verse

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,560
number 14, the Bible says this, but the spirit of the Lord departed

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,439
from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.

16
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,279
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold, now an evil spirit from God

17
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,000
troubleth thee.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,619
Let our Lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,720
to seek out a man who is a cunning player and in harp

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,340
and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee

21
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:04,019
that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,620
And so these servants, they acknowledge the problem.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,559
The problem was that the spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul

24
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,860
and he was troubled with this evil spirit.

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,839
And we find that the servants then offer a solution to the problem.

26
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:22,400
They said, We need to go and seek out a man, a man that is cunning on harp.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,480
And this is how it will work.

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,440
And Saul agreed to their plan in verse number 17.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,480
The Bible says that Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,839
that can play well and bring him to me.

31
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,519
And we find that in verse number 18, one of the servants,

32
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,419
we don't know who this is.

33
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:44,819
His name is not given to us, but one of the servants of Saul,

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,959
he stands up and he speaks to Saul.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,860
And I want you to notice what he says in verse number 18.

36
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,339
Then answered one of the servants and said,

37
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,480
Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse,

38
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,720
the Bethlehemite, that is cunning and playing

39
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:08,160
and a mighty, valiant man and a man of war

40
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:12,339
and prudent in matters and a comely person.

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,199
And the Lord is with him.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,039
Isn't that awesome?

43
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,360
What a description that this servant gives of David.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,119
We know that he's speaking of David.

45
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:28,160
The text does not say the name David because this servant simply says,

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,740
I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,539
But we understand as we read the entirety of the text

48
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,179
that he's speaking of David.

49
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:40,419
And we find that David just preceding this particular text of Scripture.

50
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,919
He, of course, was anointed by Samuel to be the next king over Israel.

51
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,960
We know that a number of years would pass

52
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,220
before he would ever come to that place of ascending to the throne

53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,399
and being the king of Israel.

54
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,820
But we find that this description is given by this servant of Saul.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,899
And what a great description it is.

56
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,440
I said to the young people in our first lesson,

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,699
oh, that someone would make this kind of statement about us,

58
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,500
not someone that we know is watching us,

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,940
that we can seek to try to,

60
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,460
you know, put on a good show for them

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,039
and try to make sure that they see our good side, so to speak.

62
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,839
But someone that's observing you, that you're not even aware

63
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,199
that they're watching you.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,820
And yet they're watching you.

65
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,479
They're observing you.

66
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,619
And what is it that they would say?

67
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:37,820
You know that here in this text of Scripture, David is not saying this of himself.

68
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,860
You find that there was not in this setting

69
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,679
the servants when they make this suggestion to Saul.

70
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,880
He says, it's a great idea.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,020
Let's put out word and let's seek applicants for this position.

72
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:59,399
Wanted a man that is skillful, cunning and playing applications to be sent to.

73
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,600
And all these people send applications in and you know how it is

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
when you submit an application.

75
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,080
I mean, you're going to put all the good stuff that you can put right.

76
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,300
And, you know, I remember when I was in some training and different things

77
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,000
and they always said, you know, one of the questions that they'll ask you is,

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
what is your your biggest weakness?

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,339
And several people out there, coaches and such,

80
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:27,239
they give you this suggestion of your weakness is that you're a perfectionist

81
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,679
and you try to do everything right and perfect and so on.

82
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,880
What a weakness. I mean, what humility, right?

83
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,720
No, no, no.

84
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,720
David wasn't submitting an application.

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,600
David didn't see the wanted sign and say, I'm going to submit my application.

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm going to talk about how good I am and all of the qualities

87
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,380
and all of the attributes that would make you, King Saul, want me to fill this position.

88
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:53,880
Didn't work that way.

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,540
The servant says, I've seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

90
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:04,359
We looked with the teenagers about this truth that people are watching you.

91
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:08,160
And then in our second lesson, we looked at that statement that is cunning and playing.

92
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,200
And of course, that was the only requirement that was set forth in verse number 16,

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,399
when it says to seek out a man who is cunning, a cunning player on an harp.

94
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,700
And we find that the first in this description that this servant gives of David

95
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
is that he is cunning in playing.

96
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:27,779
And I submitted to the young people that this is really in my mind,

97
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,279
this is the subject matter of being skillful.

98
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,880
We find that David was skillful.

99
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,559
Tonight, we're going to focus on the next two statements that are given here.

100
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:40,559
If you are taking notes, the title of the message will be the next statement here.

101
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,220
A mighty, valiant man.

102
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,459
A mighty, valiant man.

103
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,000
And then it says this, and a man of war.

104
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,440
A mighty, valiant man and a man of war.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,540
The word mighty there means it carries with it the idea of being strong, being mighty,

106
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,980
but also carries with the idea of being brave, being brave.

107
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,679
I find this evening, when I think about this description of David,

108
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,019
that he's a mighty, valiant man, that he's a man of war,

109
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,920
I think about being courageous.

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,619
And I think about the courage of David.

111
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,059
The word courage means bravery.

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:31,359
It means that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness.

113
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,459
You know, the reality is that we're going to face dangers and difficulties.

114
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,359
We're going to face those, we're going to encounter those in life.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,299
And to have courage, to be able to have that quality,

116
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,140
which would enable us when we face those dangers and those difficulties,

117
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:54,179
to face them with firmness, with valor, with boldness, with resolution.

118
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,440
We need to have courage.

119
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:03,100
We find this evening that, as we think about this term courage and being courageous,

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,839
and we see that David is described as being a mighty, valiant man, a man of war,

121
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,179
I'm, this evening, going to deal with it from the perspective of being courageous.

122
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:16,980
I want you to be mindful of what God tells Joshua in Joshua chapter number 1.

123
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Hold your place here in 1 Samuel.

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,519
In fact, you don't really need to hold your place there in 1 Samuel.

125
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,760
We won't be back there until the very end, and you can hold your place there if you want,

126
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,619
but we'll look at a number of passages.

127
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,619
But look at Joshua 1 with me.

128
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,619
And I want you to remember what the Lord told Joshua

129
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,019
as he would lead the children of Israel into the land of promise.

130
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,559
Beginning in verse number 6 of Joshua 1, the Bible says this,

131
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,299
Be strong and of a good courage.

132
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:47,339
For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land,

133
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,700
which I swear unto their fathers to give them.

134
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,420
Only be thou strong and very courageous,

135
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,700
that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law,

136
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,200
which Moses my servant commanded thee.

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,640
Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left,

138
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,540
that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.

139
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,959
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,

140
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,160
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,480
For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
and then thou shalt have good success.

144
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Notice verse number 9,

145
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Have not I commanded thee?

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,980
Be strong and of a good courage.

147
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed.

148
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,979
Notice, for the Lord thy God is with thee,

149
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,479
whithersoever thou goest.

150
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
What great encouragement the Lord gives to Joshua.

151
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,979
Would Joshua face dangers?

152
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:49,479
Would Joshua face difficulties when he would lead the children of Israel

153
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,979
into the land of promise?

154
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,979
Sure he would.

155
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,979
There would be dangers and there would be difficulties,

156
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:58,979
but we find that God tells him,

157
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,979
be courageous.

158
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,479
Have courage.

159
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:07,479
It's interesting that we know what the Lord said to Joshua here in Joshua 1,

160
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,479
and we know as we look at this mighty, valiant man,

161
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,979
a man of war, that David was courageous.

162
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,979
It's of note to say this,

163
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,979
that David, in 1 Chronicles 28,

164
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:19,479
turn over there if you will.

165
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,479
In 1 Chronicles chapter 28, as you're turning there,

166
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,479
I want you to be mindful of this,

167
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,479
that the Bible gives us the opportunity to read

168
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:32,979
of David's charge to his son Solomon before his death.

169
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,979
It's always interesting to me to read

170
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:39,479
accounts of people when they're on their deathbed.

171
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,979
What are the last things that they're going to share with someone?

172
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:47,479
Because the reality is that David understood that he would soon die,

173
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,479
and therefore the words that he would choose,

174
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:52,479
the message that he would choose to communicate

175
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,979
is of utmost importance.

176
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,979
I don't have time to just waste breath.

177
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,979
I don't have time to just waste and speak.

178
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,879
meaningless and useless words.

179
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,319
I must make my words count,

180
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,979
because I'm going to die.

181
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,339
And notice what he says in 1 Chronicles 28

182
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,719
and verse number 20.

183
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,439
The Bible says this,

184
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:16,319
And David said to Solomon his son,

185
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,239
Be strong and of a good courage,

186
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,659
and do it.

187
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,719
Fear not, nor be dismayed.

188
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,759
For the Lord God, even my God,

189
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,479
will be with thee.

190
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,479
I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,

191
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,519
until thou hast finished all the work

192
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,979
for the service of the house of the Lord.

193
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:38,059
David encouraged Solomon.

194
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,759
One of the things that he says to him

195
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,559
in the very beginning of this charge here

196
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,519
is he says, Be strong and of a good courage.

197
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,279
I think David understood the importance

198
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,879
of being courageous.

199
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,039
I believe this evening that we could ask

200
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,639
this question,

201
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,159
where does this kind of courage come from?

202
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,799
How is it that I can have this kind of courage?

203
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,039
How is it that Joshua had the courage

204
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,639
to lead the children of Israel

205
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,159
into the land of promise?

206
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,599
How is it that David had courage

207
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,679
to do what God called him to do?

208
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,239
And we'll look at a number of examples

209
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,999
of David demonstrating courage

210
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,839
as we go through the message this evening.

211
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,259
How is it that Solomon would have courage

212
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,499
to do what God has called him to do?

213
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:20,799
I believe that this courage

214
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,159
that we're speaking of this evening

215
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,359
comes from no other source but God himself.

216
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,399
Comes from the Lord.

217
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,279
It comes from the Lord.

218
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,299
It wasn't for Joshua to just go

219
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,239
and try to conjure up in of himself

220
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:37,399
or David or Solomon to have this courage,

221
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,819
I'm going to overcome!

222
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:40,659
No, no.

223
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,399
It's gonna come from God.

224
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,699
It's gonna come from the Lord.

225
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,319
I believe this evening that every single

226
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,079
child of God needs to have courage.

227
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,279
We need courage.

228
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,239
Why?

229
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,479
As I mentioned a moment ago,

230
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,399
because we are gonna face difficulties.

231
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,879
We're gonna face dangers.

232
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,999
And as we face dangers and difficulties,

233
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,679
if we're going to deal with those

234
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,679
and respond to those with firmness

235
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,379
and with boldness and with resolution,

236
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,839
then we must have courage.

237
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,239
We must have courage.

238
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,359
Notice, we're mindful of this truth

239
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,079
in the New Testament.

240
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,399
In Ephesians chapter number six,

241
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,439
it was our theme a couple of years ago,

242
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,959
be strong in the Lord.

243
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,479
In Ephesians chapter number six,

244
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:32,479
we find that the Lord gives to these

245
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,559
believers in Ephesus this charge

246
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,919
through the apostle Paul with regard

247
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,359
to the spiritual battles in which they would face.

248
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,319
The dangers that they would encounter.

249
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:46,919
We find that Paul says this in verse number 10

250
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,919
of Ephesians six,

251
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,919
finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord.

252
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
And in the power of His might.

253
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,439
You understand here in verse number 10

254
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,279
that the operative truth that is given to us

255
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,359
is that we're to be strong in the Lord.

256
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:11,359
That we're to be, and in the power of His might.

257
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,679
Listen, we are weak.

258
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,399
You know, the songwriter, when he wrote

259
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,999
the hymn that we sing,

260
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,719
stand up, stand up for Jesus.

261
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,939
By the way, that's a great song, is it not?

262
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:25,579
Because we need to be willing to stand up for the Lord.

263
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,299
But the songwriter says in one of those verses

264
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:32,099
that the arm of flesh will fail you.

265
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:32,939
Why?

266
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,619
Because it will.

267
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:36,979
Because we need to be strong in the Lord.

268
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,459
In the power of His might.

269
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,259
See, every one of us need to have

270
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,699
this attribute that we're speaking of this evening

271
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,379
of David, this attribute of courage.

272
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,379
That we would be courageous.

273
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,139
That we would have this boldness

274
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,619
and this resolution, this firmness

275
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,259
when danger and difficulty comes our way

276
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,259
that we would be able to stand.

277
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,619
But it's only gonna come from God.

278
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,059
It's only gonna come as we walk with God,

279
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,539
as we spend time with God,

280
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:08,139
as we're in His Word and we're spending time in prayer.

281
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,859
Is it not interesting to you

282
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,899
that in the passage of Scripture

283
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,739
that we looked at there,

284
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,459
that text in Joshua 1,

285
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:17,259
when God is encouraging Joshua

286
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,339
and God's telling Joshua to be courageous

287
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,339
and to have courage and to be strong,

288
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,419
that right in the midst of that passage of Scripture

289
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,699
is verse number eight,

290
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,219
but this book of the law

291
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:30,819
shall not depart out of thy mouth.

292
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:31,659
Why?

293
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:32,739
Because as we're in the Word of God,

294
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,899
it gives us courage.

295
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,779
Because God gives us courage.

296
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,659
It's easy for us to identify individuals

297
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,619
that lack courage, is it not?

298
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,579
And there are times in our lives

299
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,219
in which if we'd be honest and evaluate ourselves,

300
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:51,259
that we would say that we even have lacked courage.

301
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,619
We lack the courage that we needed in that moment,

302
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,459
in that situation.

303
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,499
But when this particular servant

304
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:02,259
hears of the problem and they identify the problem

305
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,339
that Saul has this evil spirit that's troubling him

306
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,219
because the Spirit of the Lord had departed from him,

307
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,259
and they say, we need to find a man

308
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,459
that is cunning and playing.

309
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,139
And when this evil spirit troubles you,

310
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,539
he's gonna play on that harp

311
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,779
and it's gonna be better for you, Saul.

312
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,259
And Saul says, go find me such a man.

313
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,899
And we find that the servant says,

314
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,699
there's this son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, I've seen him.

315
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,419
He's a cunning player, he's skillful,

316
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:33,139
but he's a mighty, valiant man, a man of war.

317
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,979
Now, I asked the question,

318
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,299
where does this courage come from?

319
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,459
We've answered the question, it comes from the Lord.

320
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,099
But then I wanna ask this question,

321
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:43,259
how was David's courage displayed?

322
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,759
How was his courage displayed?

323
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,359
And honestly, this evening, and maybe if you have an answer,

324
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,399
you can come let me know what your answer is,

325
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
but I'm not certain for sure as to what it was

326
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,079
that this servant saw in David that led him to declare

327
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,679
that David was a mighty, valiant man and a man of war.

328
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,039
I don't know.

329
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,279
I don't know what he saw.

330
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,879
I don't know what he observed.

331
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,719
He does not go through all of the details,

332
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,239
but we do know that as we study the life of David,

333
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,399
that there are some things that we can look to

334
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,519
and we can reference of him having courage

335
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,079
prior to this statement being made,

336
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,359
but then also the opportunity to see many examples

337
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,639
of David displaying courage

338
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,159
after this declaration was made.

339
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,319
Go back, if you will, to 1 Samuel chapter 17,

340
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:35,599
and we know that this declaration was made

341
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:38,719
in chapter number 16, and we find that Saul,

342
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,959
and he appreciated the messenger and what the messenger said

343
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,319
and so therefore he sent messengers to Jesse

344
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,079
and they brought David into his presence

345
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,479
and David had been caring for the sheep

346
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,519
and we know that he was with the sheep

347
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,839
in the beginning of chapter 16.

348
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,039
He was called away from the sheep in order to be anointed

349
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,119
and then evidently he went back to the sheep

350
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,639
and then now he's there with Saul

351
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,559
and we find that David is playing

352
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,079
and at the end of chapter number 17, or 16, excuse me,

353
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,599
we see that he was there and he became his armor bearer

354
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,879
and so on and so forth,

355
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,359
but then somewhere along the way,

356
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,159
David ends up back with the sheep.

357
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:20,639
We see that in verse number 15 of 1 Samuel 17,

358
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,439
it says this, but David went and returned from Saul

359
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem

360
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
and so we find that David's kinda going back and forth,

361
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,479
right, and we see that, and then of course,

362
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,239
we're familiar with 1 Samuel 17,

363
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,279
it's the text of scripture that reveals to us,

364
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,559
records for us, the battle between David and Goliath.

365
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,679
And we think about the way in which

366
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,759
David's courage was displayed,

367
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:48,279
we find that it first is mentioned in verses 34 through 37

368
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,999
when David is rehearsing to Saul

369
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:54,699
the encounter that he had with the lion and bear.

370
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,239
Now this is something that took place,

371
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,479
as best we can tell, probably before the statement

372
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,719
was made in chapter number 16,

373
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,919
but because he went back and forth to the sheep,

374
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,359
we can't be certain 100% that it happened

375
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,039
before that declaration in chapter 16 by this servant,

376
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,959
but it certainly possibly could have been

377
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,559
in one of the reasons in which this servant

378
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,959
would have said that he was a mighty, valiant man,

379
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,679
and notice here what David says in verse 34,

380
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,839
and David said unto Saul,

381
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,359
thy servant kept his father's sheep,

382
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,439
and there came a lion and a bear,

383
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,039
and took a lamb out of the flock.

384
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,619
Now I'm not sure what you would have done,

385
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,959
and you may not be sure what you would have done,

386
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,859
but if I could be honest with you for a moment tonight,

387
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,820
I probably would have said, too bad for that lamb.

388
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,199
I'm being honest with you.

389
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,659
I don't know that I would have gone after a lion or a bear.

390
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,940
If you want to sit there in your seat

391
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,899
and say that you would have,

392
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,679
that's between you and the Lord.

393
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,219
I'm just being honest with you.

394
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,940
I think I probably, John, would have said,

395
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,479
well, we'll have to deal with that somehow.

396
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,039
Let's try to protect the rest, honestly,

397
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,059
but look at what it says in verse 35,

398
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,000
and I went out after him.

399
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,719
Now, even if I went out after him,

400
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,959
I probably would have just been trying

401
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,919
to look at where he went.

402
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,399
You understand what I'm saying?

403
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,440
I wouldn't have gone after him, like pursuing him,

404
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,079
but that's what David did.

405
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,519
I went out after him, and what does it say?

406
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,479
And smote him.

407
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,919
Is that what it says in your Bible?

408
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,479
That's what it says in my Bible.

409
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,679
David, he's standing there before Saul,

410
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,559
and he says, listen, I was taking care of the sheep,

411
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,799
and there's a lion and a bear,

412
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,479
and they took a lamb out of the flock,

413
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,159
and I went out after him, and I smote him,

414
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,639
and delivered it out of his mouth,

415
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:56,719
and when he arose against me, can you imagine this?

416
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,579
Listen, I understand all the kids know this.

417
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,119
We know this, we've read this.

418
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,659
But a lion and a bear, and it rose against me?

419
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:14,739
I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and flew him."

420
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:22,559
Go David, amen?

421
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:30,519
That's courage, danger, difficulty, uh-huh.

422
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,359
Thy servant, verse 36, slew both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine

423
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:42,079
shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.

424
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,199
David said, moreover, the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the

425
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,839
paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.

426
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,939
And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee.

427
00:20:55,939 --> 00:21:01,479
So we see that David's courage is displayed as he rehearses here this event that took

428
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,839
place in his life with the lion and the bear.

429
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:11,479
I believe that his courage is displayed in just a few more verses when he faces Goliath.

430
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,659
The Bible tells us, we don't have time to look at all of it, but the Bible tells us

431
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:21,299
that of course Goliath had defied the armies of the living God, and Goliath comes, and

432
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:26,459
every day he presents himself, and give us a man, give me a man that we might fight.

433
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:31,139
And David comes, he's following the instruction of his father, and he comes to the place of

434
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:38,179
battle to bring some supplies, and his brother says, I know the pride, the haughtiness of

435
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:39,179
thine heart.

436
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:45,139
David hears what this Philistine says, what Goliath says, and he says this, is there not

437
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:49,499
a cause?

438
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:52,499
Who's going to fight against this guy?

439
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:53,499
Everybody's afraid.

440
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:58,579
David says, I'll go.

441
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,339
I'll deal with this danger and this difficulty.

442
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:02,339
Why?

443
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:03,779
Remember, where does the courage come from?

444
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:06,539
It comes from God.

445
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,899
Remember the promise in Joshua 1 and verse number 9 was that the Lord says, I will be

446
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:11,899
with thee.

447
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:12,899
Right?

448
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,799
Knowing that God is with you gives you great courage.

449
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,500
What is it that David said to Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28 and verse number 20?

450
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,259
He tells him to be courageous, but he says, the Lord will be with you.

451
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,779
Having a knowledge of the presence of God with you enables you to have that courage.

452
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,779
Why?

453
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,979
Because God's giving you that courage.

454
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:38,419
The Bible tells us here in verse number 46, this day, this is David now speaking back

455
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:43,979
to Goliath, this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee

456
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:48,339
and take thine head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines

457
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:52,139
this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast of the earth, that all the

458
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:57,539
earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

459
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,659
I don't think David was just being cocky or prideful.

460
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:02,659
He was being courageous.

461
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,699
And he's saying to Goliath, this is what's going to happen.

462
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:06,699
Why?

463
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:12,580
Because God is going to give me the battle, the victory, and he says that all the earth

464
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,360
might know that there's a God in Israel.

465
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,659
David was not seeking to be courageous so that people could look at David?

466
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:26,539
Yes, the Bible tells us in chapter 18 that the ladies, they sing the praises and they

467
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,819
say Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.

468
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,459
But you understand, that's not what David was trying to get.

469
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,459
That's not what he was after.

470
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,619
That's not what he was pursuing.

471
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:44,459
He was about magnifying and exalting the Lord, that all the earth might know that there's

472
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,459
a God in Israel.

473
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:49,899
And it says in verse 47, and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword

474
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:55,580
and spear, for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.

475
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,500
Notice the end of verse number 48.

476
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,860
David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

477
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,659
That's courage.

478
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,139
He ran straight to him.

479
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:12,339
We know that God gave the victory.

480
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:15,979
It tells us in verse 50, so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling with a stone

481
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:18,299
and smote the Philistine and slew him.

482
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,100
There was no sword in the hand of David, therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and

483
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,019
took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head

484
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,019
therewith.

485
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,380
And when the Philistine saw their champion was dead, they fled.

486
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,299
They didn't have courage.

487
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:39,459
They seemed to have courage so long as the Philistine was alive.

488
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:40,699
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

489
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:45,579
See the battle in array as Goliath goes out there and pounds his chest and he's the champion

490
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:50,579
of the Philistines and let a man come and fight against me and they see all of the children

491
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,299
of Israel hiding and covering by a rock.

492
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,339
Those guys, they probably got courage as long as Goliath's there.

493
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:04,779
As soon as Goliath died, those guys fled.

494
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,739
They fled.

495
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,699
We see David's courage with the lion and the bear.

496
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:13,820
We see David's courage with the Philistine with Goliath.

497
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,359
I think about his courage as it's displayed with the Philistines in general.

498
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,320
If you read chapter 18, we won't have time.

499
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,679
We're going to wrap up here in just a few minutes, but in chapter number 18, you see

500
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,639
many instances in which David goes out and departs and he's fighting against the Philistines

501
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:33,000
and God gives him victory and God is using David.

502
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,119
He behaves himself wisely.

503
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,000
The Bible uses that phraseology in chapter number 18 multiple times and we find that

504
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,199
God is using David and David is displaying his courage.

505
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:54,079
You can look at 1 Samuel chapter 23 and you can read of when the Philistines invaded the

506
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:00,799
city of Keilah and as these inhabitants of the city, they were just fearful for their

507
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,199
lives and the Philistines had invaded and what are we going to do?

508
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:09,279
We find that David and his men, they receive word and David's ready to go and to deliver

509
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,239
them and the men that David has with him, they're dealing with a little bit of fear

510
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,040
and they want him to inquire of the Lord yet again and David inquires of the Lord yet again

511
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,040
and God gives victory.

512
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:29,040
David, yes, we understand that the Bible tells us even as the servant says that he was a

513
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,000
man of war and thus, of course, he did not build the temple.

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,639
One of the reasons in which he did not build the temple that God gives through the prophet

515
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,679
Nathan, but I want you to see that David, he had great courage.

516
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,839
We could go example after example after example of the life of David this evening, but for

517
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,320
sake of time, I think that each of us would just simply agree that David was courageous.

518
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,639
He was a mighty valiant man, a man of war.

519
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:06,720
Again, I don't know all of the reasons that this servant after observing David, I'm not

520
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,799
sure of all that he observed that led him to this conclusion, but I know there's some

521
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:17,000
things that we can read that God has preserved for us in His Word that would lead us to the

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,199
same conclusion.

523
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,399
David was courageous and we see it displayed.

524
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,399
My question for myself this evening, my question for you tonight is this, do we have courage?

525
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:38,760
Do we have the courage to stand when the dangers and the difficulties arise and they will?

526
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,479
Maybe I should say they are.

527
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:55,000
Do we have the firmness, the boldness, are we resolved to stand, to have that courage?

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,720
Only be thou courageous, oh that God would help us to display courage, not because we're

529
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,679
trying to get any recognition for ourselves, because we understand that the courage is

530
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,199
not something that we've just conjured up in of ourselves.

531
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:16,760
It's courage that comes from God and as He gives us the courage and as we are strong

532
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:24,479
in the Lord and in the power of His might, then we're able to stand with firmness and

533
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:30,279
with boldness, with courage, when those dangers and difficulties arise.

534
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,159
And they will, they do, they are.

535
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,400
And so tonight, David, he's a mighty valiant man, he's a man of war.

536
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,599
Remember David's not saying that about himself.

537
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:52,200
That's somebody that's observing David that David doesn't even know is observing him.

538
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
What would they say of you?

539
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,719
What would they say of me?

540
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:59,279
I'm not talking about the person that we know that's watching us.

541
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,960
I'm talking about the person that we don't even know that's watching you, that's watching

542
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,239
me.

543
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:07,880
Would they say that you're courageous?

544
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,960
Would they say that you have courage to stand, to have that boldness?

545
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,839
Oh, that God would help us.

546
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,839
Let's pray.

547
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,839
Father, we love you.

548
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,919
We thank you for loving us.

549
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,039
We thank you for the opportunity to gather together this evening and to open your Word

550
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,279
and to study it for a few moments.

551
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,419
We thank you for the example of David.

552
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:37,339
We thank you for the truth that you've given us in your Word with regard to courage and

553
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:40,260
being courageous.

554
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,339
God I pray that as we face dangers and difficulties that you would strengthen us and that you

555
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:49,219
would help us to respond to those dangers and difficulties with this firmness, this

556
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:57,419
boldness, this resolution.

557
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,219
Help us to stand up, to stand up for Jesus.

558
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:02,319
us.

559
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,279
Would You bless our time of prayer?

560
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,239
Do thank You for the privilege of prayer.

561
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:11,439
I pray that You'd meet with us during this time of prayer, that You'd be glorified.

562
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,279
We'll thank You for it, in Christ's name we pray, amen.
