WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
on Wednesday evenings through the summer.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.079
Of course, my dad has been teaching through Psalm 23.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.600
And what a great study that has been.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.279
I know that I have enjoyed it.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.880
I trust that many of you as have as well.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.139
And every other week, Brother Mark and I are switching back and forth

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:19.620
with the teen class.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.879
And so I did a little series this summer with the teens.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.379
This is actually only the third lesson,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.860
but it was the lesson I was going to teach this evening.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.360
I figured I'd go ahead and just preach it, teach it for you this evening

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.400
and trust it will be a blessing to you.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.060
And notice with me in First Samuel, chapter number 16, beginning in verse

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.560
number 14, the Bible says this, but the spirit of the Lord departed

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.439
from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.279
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold, now an evil spirit from God

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.000
troubleth thee.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.619
Let our Lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.720
to seek out a man who is a cunning player and in harp

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.340
and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:04.019
that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.620
And so these servants, they acknowledge the problem.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.559
The problem was that the spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:12.860
and he was troubled with this evil spirit.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.839
And we find that the servants then offer a solution to the problem.

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:22.400
They said, We need to go and seek out a man, a man that is cunning on harp.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.480
And this is how it will work.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.440
And Saul agreed to their plan in verse number 17.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.480
The Bible says that Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.839
that can play well and bring him to me.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.519
And we find that in verse number 18, one of the servants,

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.419
we don't know who this is.

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.819
His name is not given to us, but one of the servants of Saul,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.959
he stands up and he speaks to Saul.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.860
And I want you to notice what he says in verse number 18.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.339
Then answered one of the servants and said,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.480
Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse,

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.720
the Bethlehemite, that is cunning and playing

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:08.160
and a mighty, valiant man and a man of war

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:12.339
and prudent in matters and a comely person.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.199
And the Lord is with him.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.039
Isn't that awesome?

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.360
What a description that this servant gives of David.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.119
We know that he's speaking of David.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.160
The text does not say the name David because this servant simply says,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.740
I have seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.539
But we understand as we read the entirety of the text

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.179
that he's speaking of David.

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:40.419
And we find that David just preceding this particular text of Scripture.

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.919
He, of course, was anointed by Samuel to be the next king over Israel.

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.960
We know that a number of years would pass

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.220
before he would ever come to that place of ascending to the throne

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.399
and being the king of Israel.

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:55.820
But we find that this description is given by this servant of Saul.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.899
And what a great description it is.

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.440
I said to the young people in our first lesson,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.699
oh, that someone would make this kind of statement about us,

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.500
not someone that we know is watching us,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.940
that we can seek to try to,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.460
you know, put on a good show for them

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.039
and try to make sure that they see our good side, so to speak.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.839
But someone that's observing you, that you're not even aware

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.199
that they're watching you.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.820
And yet they're watching you.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.479
They're observing you.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.619
And what is it that they would say?

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.820
You know that here in this text of Scripture, David is not saying this of himself.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.860
You find that there was not in this setting

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.679
the servants when they make this suggestion to Saul.

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:46.880
He says, it's a great idea.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.020
Let's put out word and let's seek applicants for this position.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:59.399
Wanted a man that is skillful, cunning and playing applications to be sent to.

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.600
And all these people send applications in and you know how it is

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300
when you submit an application.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.080
I mean, you're going to put all the good stuff that you can put right.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.300
And, you know, I remember when I was in some training and different things

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.000
and they always said, you know, one of the questions that they'll ask you is,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.600
what is your your biggest weakness?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.339
And several people out there, coaches and such,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:27.239
they give you this suggestion of your weakness is that you're a perfectionist

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.679
and you try to do everything right and perfect and so on.

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.880
What a weakness. I mean, what humility, right?

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.720
No, no, no.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.720
David wasn't submitting an application.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600
David didn't see the wanted sign and say, I'm going to submit my application.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.140
I'm going to talk about how good I am and all of the qualities

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.380
and all of the attributes that would make you, King Saul, want me to fill this position.

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:53.880
Didn't work that way.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.540
The servant says, I've seen a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:04.359
We looked with the teenagers about this truth that people are watching you.

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.160
And then in our second lesson, we looked at that statement that is cunning and playing.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.200
And of course, that was the only requirement that was set forth in verse number 16,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.399
when it says to seek out a man who is cunning, a cunning player on an harp.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.700
And we find that the first in this description that this servant gives of David

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.500
is that he is cunning in playing.

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:27.779
And I submitted to the young people that this is really in my mind,

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.279
this is the subject matter of being skillful.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.880
We find that David was skillful.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.559
Tonight, we're going to focus on the next two statements that are given here.

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:40.559
If you are taking notes, the title of the message will be the next statement here.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.220
A mighty, valiant man.

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:48.459
A mighty, valiant man.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.000
And then it says this, and a man of war.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.440
A mighty, valiant man and a man of war.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.540
The word mighty there means it carries with it the idea of being strong, being mighty,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.980
but also carries with the idea of being brave, being brave.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.679
I find this evening, when I think about this description of David,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.019
that he's a mighty, valiant man, that he's a man of war,

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:16.920
I think about being courageous.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.619
And I think about the courage of David.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.059
The word courage means bravery.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:31.359
It means that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.459
You know, the reality is that we're going to face dangers and difficulties.

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:40.359
We're going to face those, we're going to encounter those in life.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.299
And to have courage, to be able to have that quality,

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.140
which would enable us when we face those dangers and those difficulties,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:54.179
to face them with firmness, with valor, with boldness, with resolution.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.440
We need to have courage.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:03.100
We find this evening that, as we think about this term courage and being courageous,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.839
and we see that David is described as being a mighty, valiant man, a man of war,

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.179
I'm, this evening, going to deal with it from the perspective of being courageous.

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:16.980
I want you to be mindful of what God tells Joshua in Joshua chapter number 1.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.980
Hold your place here in 1 Samuel.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.519
In fact, you don't really need to hold your place there in 1 Samuel.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.760
We won't be back there until the very end, and you can hold your place there if you want,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.619
but we'll look at a number of passages.

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:28.619
But look at Joshua 1 with me.

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:31.619
And I want you to remember what the Lord told Joshua

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:35.019
as he would lead the children of Israel into the land of promise.

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:38.559
Beginning in verse number 6 of Joshua 1, the Bible says this,

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.299
Be strong and of a good courage.

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:47.339
For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land,

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.700
which I swear unto their fathers to give them.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.420
Only be thou strong and very courageous,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.700
that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.200
which Moses my servant commanded thee.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.640
Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.540
that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.959
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:12.160
but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.000
that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.480
For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.480
and then thou shalt have good success.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480
Notice verse number 9,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480
Have not I commanded thee?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.980
Be strong and of a good courage.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.980
Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.979
Notice, for the Lord thy God is with thee,

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:38.479
whithersoever thou goest.

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.479
What great encouragement the Lord gives to Joshua.

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.979
Would Joshua face dangers?

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.479
Would Joshua face difficulties when he would lead the children of Israel

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:50.979
into the land of promise?

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:53.979
Sure he would.

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:56.979
There would be dangers and there would be difficulties,

00:08:56.979 --> 00:08:58.979
but we find that God tells him,

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:00.979
be courageous.

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:02.479
Have courage.

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:07.479
It's interesting that we know what the Lord said to Joshua here in Joshua 1,

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.479
and we know as we look at this mighty, valiant man,

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:12.979
a man of war, that David was courageous.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:14.979
It's of note to say this,

00:09:14.979 --> 00:09:17.979
that David, in 1 Chronicles 28,

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:19.479
turn over there if you will.

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:22.479
In 1 Chronicles chapter 28, as you're turning there,

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.479
I want you to be mindful of this,

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:27.479
that the Bible gives us the opportunity to read

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:32.979
of David's charge to his son Solomon before his death.

00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:35.979
It's always interesting to me to read

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:39.479
accounts of people when they're on their deathbed.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.979
What are the last things that they're going to share with someone?

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:47.479
Because the reality is that David understood that he would soon die,

00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:49.479
and therefore the words that he would choose,

00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:52.479
the message that he would choose to communicate

00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:54.979
is of utmost importance.

00:09:54.979 --> 00:09:56.979
I don't have time to just waste breath.

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:59.979
I don't have time to just waste and speak.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:02.879
meaningless and useless words.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.319
I must make my words count,

00:10:05.319 --> 00:10:06.979
because I'm going to die.

00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:09.339
And notice what he says in 1 Chronicles 28

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:10.719
and verse number 20.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:12.439
The Bible says this,

00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:16.319
And David said to Solomon his son,

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:20.239
Be strong and of a good courage,

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:21.659
and do it.

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:24.719
Fear not, nor be dismayed.

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:26.759
For the Lord God, even my God,

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.479
will be with thee.

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:30.479
I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,

00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:32.519
until thou hast finished all the work

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:35.979
for the service of the house of the Lord.

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:38.059
David encouraged Solomon.

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:39.759
One of the things that he says to him

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.559
in the very beginning of this charge here

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:44.519
is he says, Be strong and of a good courage.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.279
I think David understood the importance

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.879
of being courageous.

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:50.039
I believe this evening that we could ask

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:51.639
this question,

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.159
where does this kind of courage come from?

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.799
How is it that I can have this kind of courage?

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:01.039
How is it that Joshua had the courage

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.639
to lead the children of Israel

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.159
into the land of promise?

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.599
How is it that David had courage

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.679
to do what God called him to do?

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:10.239
And we'll look at a number of examples

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:11.999
of David demonstrating courage

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:13.839
as we go through the message this evening.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.259
How is it that Solomon would have courage

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:19.499
to do what God has called him to do?

00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:20.799
I believe that this courage

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:22.159
that we're speaking of this evening

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.359
comes from no other source but God himself.

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:26.399
Comes from the Lord.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:29.279
It comes from the Lord.

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.299
It wasn't for Joshua to just go

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:34.239
and try to conjure up in of himself

00:11:34.239 --> 00:11:37.399
or David or Solomon to have this courage,

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.819
I'm going to overcome!

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:40.659
No, no.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:43.399
It's gonna come from God.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.699
It's gonna come from the Lord.

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:50.319
I believe this evening that every single

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:53.079
child of God needs to have courage.

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.279
We need courage.

00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:56.239
Why?

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:57.479
As I mentioned a moment ago,

00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.399
because we are gonna face difficulties.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.879
We're gonna face dangers.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:05.999
And as we face dangers and difficulties,

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:07.679
if we're going to deal with those

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.679
and respond to those with firmness

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:12.379
and with boldness and with resolution,

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:15.839
then we must have courage.

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.239
We must have courage.

00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:19.359
Notice, we're mindful of this truth

00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:21.079
in the New Testament.

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:23.399
In Ephesians chapter number six,

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:25.439
it was our theme a couple of years ago,

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:26.959
be strong in the Lord.

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:28.479
In Ephesians chapter number six,

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:32.479
we find that the Lord gives to these

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:34.559
believers in Ephesus this charge

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:37.919
through the apostle Paul with regard

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:41.359
to the spiritual battles in which they would face.

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:44.319
The dangers that they would encounter.

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:46.919
We find that Paul says this in verse number 10

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:47.919
of Ephesians six,

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:52.919
finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord.

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:57.279
And in the power of His might.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.439
You understand here in verse number 10

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:03.279
that the operative truth that is given to us

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:06.359
is that we're to be strong in the Lord.

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:11.359
That we're to be, and in the power of His might.

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.679
Listen, we are weak.

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:15.399
You know, the songwriter, when he wrote

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.999
the hymn that we sing,

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.719
stand up, stand up for Jesus.

00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:21.939
By the way, that's a great song, is it not?

00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:25.579
Because we need to be willing to stand up for the Lord.

00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:28.299
But the songwriter says in one of those verses

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:32.099
that the arm of flesh will fail you.

00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:32.939
Why?

00:13:32.939 --> 00:13:34.619
Because it will.

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:36.979
Because we need to be strong in the Lord.

00:13:36.979 --> 00:13:39.459
In the power of His might.

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:41.259
See, every one of us need to have

00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:43.699
this attribute that we're speaking of this evening

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:47.379
of David, this attribute of courage.

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:49.379
That we would be courageous.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:52.139
That we would have this boldness

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:54.619
and this resolution, this firmness

00:13:54.619 --> 00:13:57.259
when danger and difficulty comes our way

00:13:57.259 --> 00:13:59.259
that we would be able to stand.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:00.619
But it's only gonna come from God.

00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:03.059
It's only gonna come as we walk with God,

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:04.539
as we spend time with God,

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:08.139
as we're in His Word and we're spending time in prayer.

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:10.859
Is it not interesting to you

00:14:10.859 --> 00:14:12.899
that in the passage of Scripture

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:13.739
that we looked at there,

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.459
that text in Joshua 1,

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.259
when God is encouraging Joshua

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:19.339
and God's telling Joshua to be courageous

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:22.339
and to have courage and to be strong,

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:25.419
that right in the midst of that passage of Scripture

00:14:25.419 --> 00:14:26.699
is verse number eight,

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.219
but this book of the law

00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:30.819
shall not depart out of thy mouth.

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:31.659
Why?

00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:32.739
Because as we're in the Word of God,

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.899
it gives us courage.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:36.779
Because God gives us courage.

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:39.659
It's easy for us to identify individuals

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:41.619
that lack courage, is it not?

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:44.579
And there are times in our lives

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:47.219
in which if we'd be honest and evaluate ourselves,

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:51.259
that we would say that we even have lacked courage.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:54.619
We lack the courage that we needed in that moment,

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:56.459
in that situation.

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:58.499
But when this particular servant

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:02.259
hears of the problem and they identify the problem

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:05.339
that Saul has this evil spirit that's troubling him

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.219
because the Spirit of the Lord had departed from him,

00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:09.259
and they say, we need to find a man

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:10.459
that is cunning and playing.

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:12.139
And when this evil spirit troubles you,

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:13.539
he's gonna play on that harp

00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:15.779
and it's gonna be better for you, Saul.

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:18.259
And Saul says, go find me such a man.

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:19.899
And we find that the servant says,

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:23.699
there's this son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, I've seen him.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:28.419
He's a cunning player, he's skillful,

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:33.139
but he's a mighty, valiant man, a man of war.

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:34.979
Now, I asked the question,

00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:36.299
where does this courage come from?

00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:39.459
We've answered the question, it comes from the Lord.

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:41.099
But then I wanna ask this question,

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:43.259
how was David's courage displayed?

00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:45.759
How was his courage displayed?

00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:48.359
And honestly, this evening, and maybe if you have an answer,

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.399
you can come let me know what your answer is,

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:54.079
but I'm not certain for sure as to what it was

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:59.079
that this servant saw in David that led him to declare

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.679
that David was a mighty, valiant man and a man of war.

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:04.039
I don't know.

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:05.279
I don't know what he saw.

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:06.879
I don't know what he observed.

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:09.719
He does not go through all of the details,

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:13.239
but we do know that as we study the life of David,

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:15.399
that there are some things that we can look to

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:18.519
and we can reference of him having courage

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.079
prior to this statement being made,

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:24.359
but then also the opportunity to see many examples

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.639
of David displaying courage

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.159
after this declaration was made.

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:32.319
Go back, if you will, to 1 Samuel chapter 17,

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:35.599
and we know that this declaration was made

00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:38.719
in chapter number 16, and we find that Saul,

00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:42.959
and he appreciated the messenger and what the messenger said

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.319
and so therefore he sent messengers to Jesse

00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:48.079
and they brought David into his presence

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.479
and David had been caring for the sheep

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:52.519
and we know that he was with the sheep

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:53.839
in the beginning of chapter 16.

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:57.039
He was called away from the sheep in order to be anointed

00:16:57.039 --> 00:16:59.119
and then evidently he went back to the sheep

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.639
and then now he's there with Saul

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:05.559
and we find that David is playing

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:09.079
and at the end of chapter number 17, or 16, excuse me,

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.599
we see that he was there and he became his armor bearer

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.879
and so on and so forth,

00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:15.359
but then somewhere along the way,

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.159
David ends up back with the sheep.

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:20.639
We see that in verse number 15 of 1 Samuel 17,

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:23.439
it says this, but David went and returned from Saul

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:25.599
to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.919
and so we find that David's kinda going back and forth,

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:30.479
right, and we see that, and then of course,

00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:32.239
we're familiar with 1 Samuel 17,

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:34.279
it's the text of scripture that reveals to us,

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:38.559
records for us, the battle between David and Goliath.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:41.679
And we think about the way in which

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.759
David's courage was displayed,

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:48.279
we find that it first is mentioned in verses 34 through 37

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:50.999
when David is rehearsing to Saul

00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:54.699
the encounter that he had with the lion and bear.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.239
Now this is something that took place,

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:00.479
as best we can tell, probably before the statement

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.719
was made in chapter number 16,

00:18:02.719 --> 00:18:04.919
but because he went back and forth to the sheep,

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:08.359
we can't be certain 100% that it happened

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:12.039
before that declaration in chapter 16 by this servant,

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:13.959
but it certainly possibly could have been

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.559
in one of the reasons in which this servant

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.959
would have said that he was a mighty, valiant man,

00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:21.679
and notice here what David says in verse 34,

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.839
and David said unto Saul,

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:26.359
thy servant kept his father's sheep,

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:28.439
and there came a lion and a bear,

00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:31.039
and took a lamb out of the flock.

00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:34.619
Now I'm not sure what you would have done,

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.959
and you may not be sure what you would have done,

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:40.859
but if I could be honest with you for a moment tonight,

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:43.820
I probably would have said, too bad for that lamb.

00:18:47.779 --> 00:18:49.199
I'm being honest with you.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.659
I don't know that I would have gone after a lion or a bear.

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:55.940
If you want to sit there in your seat

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.899
and say that you would have,

00:18:57.899 --> 00:18:59.679
that's between you and the Lord.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.219
I'm just being honest with you.

00:19:02.139 --> 00:19:03.940
I think I probably, John, would have said,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.479
well, we'll have to deal with that somehow.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:12.039
Let's try to protect the rest, honestly,

00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:15.059
but look at what it says in verse 35,

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:21.000
and I went out after him.

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.719
Now, even if I went out after him,

00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:24.959
I probably would have just been trying

00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:25.919
to look at where he went.

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.399
You understand what I'm saying?

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:30.440
I wouldn't have gone after him, like pursuing him,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.079
but that's what David did.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:35.519
I went out after him, and what does it say?

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:37.479
And smote him.

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:38.919
Is that what it says in your Bible?

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:40.479
That's what it says in my Bible.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.679
David, he's standing there before Saul,

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:44.559
and he says, listen, I was taking care of the sheep,

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.799
and there's a lion and a bear,

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:47.479
and they took a lamb out of the flock,

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:50.159
and I went out after him, and I smote him,

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:52.639
and delivered it out of his mouth,

00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:56.719
and when he arose against me, can you imagine this?

00:19:56.719 --> 00:19:58.579
Listen, I understand all the kids know this.

00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:00.119
We know this, we've read this.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:06.659
But a lion and a bear, and it rose against me?

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:14.739
I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and flew him."

00:20:14.739 --> 00:20:22.559
Go David, amen?

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:30.519
That's courage, danger, difficulty, uh-huh.

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:36.359
Thy servant, verse 36, slew both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:42.079
shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:46.199
David said, moreover, the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the

00:20:46.199 --> 00:20:49.839
paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:55.939
And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee.

00:20:55.939 --> 00:21:01.479
So we see that David's courage is displayed as he rehearses here this event that took

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.839
place in his life with the lion and the bear.

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:11.479
I believe that his courage is displayed in just a few more verses when he faces Goliath.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.659
The Bible tells us, we don't have time to look at all of it, but the Bible tells us

00:21:14.659 --> 00:21:21.299
that of course Goliath had defied the armies of the living God, and Goliath comes, and

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:26.459
every day he presents himself, and give us a man, give me a man that we might fight.

00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:31.139
And David comes, he's following the instruction of his father, and he comes to the place of

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:38.179
battle to bring some supplies, and his brother says, I know the pride, the haughtiness of

00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:39.179
thine heart.

00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:45.139
David hears what this Philistine says, what Goliath says, and he says this, is there not

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:49.499
a cause?

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:52.499
Who's going to fight against this guy?

00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:53.499
Everybody's afraid.

00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:58.579
David says, I'll go.

00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:01.339
I'll deal with this danger and this difficulty.

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:02.339
Why?

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:03.779
Remember, where does the courage come from?

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:06.539
It comes from God.

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:10.899
Remember the promise in Joshua 1 and verse number 9 was that the Lord says, I will be

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:11.899
with thee.

00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:12.899
Right?

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:14.799
Knowing that God is with you gives you great courage.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:18.500
What is it that David said to Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28 and verse number 20?

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.259
He tells him to be courageous, but he says, the Lord will be with you.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:27.779
Having a knowledge of the presence of God with you enables you to have that courage.

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:28.779
Why?

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:31.979
Because God's giving you that courage.

00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:38.419
The Bible tells us here in verse number 46, this day, this is David now speaking back

00:22:38.419 --> 00:22:43.979
to Goliath, this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:48.339
and take thine head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines

00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:52.139
this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast of the earth, that all the

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:57.539
earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:01.659
I don't think David was just being cocky or prideful.

00:23:01.659 --> 00:23:02.659
He was being courageous.

00:23:02.659 --> 00:23:05.699
And he's saying to Goliath, this is what's going to happen.

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:06.699
Why?

00:23:06.699 --> 00:23:12.580
Because God is going to give me the battle, the victory, and he says that all the earth

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.360
might know that there's a God in Israel.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.659
David was not seeking to be courageous so that people could look at David?

00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:26.539
Yes, the Bible tells us in chapter 18 that the ladies, they sing the praises and they

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:30.819
say Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:35.459
But you understand, that's not what David was trying to get.

00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:36.459
That's not what he was after.

00:23:36.459 --> 00:23:38.619
That's not what he was pursuing.

00:23:38.619 --> 00:23:44.459
He was about magnifying and exalting the Lord, that all the earth might know that there's

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:45.459
a God in Israel.

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:49.899
And it says in verse 47, and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword

00:23:49.899 --> 00:23:55.580
and spear, for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.500
Notice the end of verse number 48.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.860
David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.659
That's courage.

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:09.139
He ran straight to him.

00:24:09.139 --> 00:24:12.339
We know that God gave the victory.

00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:15.979
It tells us in verse 50, so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling with a stone

00:24:15.979 --> 00:24:18.299
and smote the Philistine and slew him.

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:22.100
There was no sword in the hand of David, therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.019
took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:27.019
therewith.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:31.380
And when the Philistine saw their champion was dead, they fled.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.299
They didn't have courage.

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:39.459
They seemed to have courage so long as the Philistine was alive.

00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:40.699
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:45.579
See the battle in array as Goliath goes out there and pounds his chest and he's the champion

00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:50.579
of the Philistines and let a man come and fight against me and they see all of the children

00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:54.299
of Israel hiding and covering by a rock.

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:58.339
Those guys, they probably got courage as long as Goliath's there.

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:04.779
As soon as Goliath died, those guys fled.

00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:07.739
They fled.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:10.699
We see David's courage with the lion and the bear.

00:25:10.699 --> 00:25:13.820
We see David's courage with the Philistine with Goliath.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.359
I think about his courage as it's displayed with the Philistines in general.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:20.320
If you read chapter 18, we won't have time.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.679
We're going to wrap up here in just a few minutes, but in chapter number 18, you see

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:29.639
many instances in which David goes out and departs and he's fighting against the Philistines

00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:33.000
and God gives him victory and God is using David.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.119
He behaves himself wisely.

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:40.000
The Bible uses that phraseology in chapter number 18 multiple times and we find that

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.199
God is using David and David is displaying his courage.

00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:54.079
You can look at 1 Samuel chapter 23 and you can read of when the Philistines invaded the

00:25:54.079 --> 00:26:00.799
city of Keilah and as these inhabitants of the city, they were just fearful for their

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:04.199
lives and the Philistines had invaded and what are we going to do?

00:26:04.199 --> 00:26:09.279
We find that David and his men, they receive word and David's ready to go and to deliver

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:14.239
them and the men that David has with him, they're dealing with a little bit of fear

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.040
and they want him to inquire of the Lord yet again and David inquires of the Lord yet again

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.040
and God gives victory.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:29.040
David, yes, we understand that the Bible tells us even as the servant says that he was a

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.000
man of war and thus, of course, he did not build the temple.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.639
One of the reasons in which he did not build the temple that God gives through the prophet

00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:43.679
Nathan, but I want you to see that David, he had great courage.

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:49.839
We could go example after example after example of the life of David this evening, but for

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:55.320
sake of time, I think that each of us would just simply agree that David was courageous.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.639
He was a mighty valiant man, a man of war.

00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:06.720
Again, I don't know all of the reasons that this servant after observing David, I'm not

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.799
sure of all that he observed that led him to this conclusion, but I know there's some

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:17.000
things that we can read that God has preserved for us in His Word that would lead us to the

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.199
same conclusion.

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:22.399
David was courageous and we see it displayed.

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:29.399
My question for myself this evening, my question for you tonight is this, do we have courage?

00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:38.760
Do we have the courage to stand when the dangers and the difficulties arise and they will?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.479
Maybe I should say they are.

00:27:43.479 --> 00:27:55.000
Do we have the firmness, the boldness, are we resolved to stand, to have that courage?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.720
Only be thou courageous, oh that God would help us to display courage, not because we're

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.679
trying to get any recognition for ourselves, because we understand that the courage is

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:11.199
not something that we've just conjured up in of ourselves.

00:28:11.199 --> 00:28:16.760
It's courage that comes from God and as He gives us the courage and as we are strong

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:24.479
in the Lord and in the power of His might, then we're able to stand with firmness and

00:28:24.479 --> 00:28:30.279
with boldness, with courage, when those dangers and difficulties arise.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:35.159
And they will, they do, they are.

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:41.400
And so tonight, David, he's a mighty valiant man, he's a man of war.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.599
Remember David's not saying that about himself.

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:52.200
That's somebody that's observing David that David doesn't even know is observing him.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200
What would they say of you?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.719
What would they say of me?

00:28:55.719 --> 00:28:59.279
I'm not talking about the person that we know that's watching us.

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:03.960
I'm talking about the person that we don't even know that's watching you, that's watching

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.239
me.

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:07.880
Would they say that you're courageous?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.960
Would they say that you have courage to stand, to have that boldness?

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.839
Oh, that God would help us.

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:15.839
Let's pray.

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:16.839
Father, we love you.

00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:18.919
We thank you for loving us.

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:24.039
We thank you for the opportunity to gather together this evening and to open your Word

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:27.279
and to study it for a few moments.

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:30.419
We thank you for the example of David.

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:37.339
We thank you for the truth that you've given us in your Word with regard to courage and

00:29:37.339 --> 00:29:40.260
being courageous.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.339
God I pray that as we face dangers and difficulties that you would strengthen us and that you

00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:49.219
would help us to respond to those dangers and difficulties with this firmness, this

00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:57.419
boldness, this resolution.

00:29:57.419 --> 00:30:00.219
Help us to stand up, to stand up for Jesus.

00:30:00.219 --> 00:30:02.319
us.

00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:04.279
Would You bless our time of prayer?

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:06.239
Do thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:11.439
I pray that You'd meet with us during this time of prayer, that You'd be glorified.

00:30:11.439 --> 00:30:14.279
We'll thank You for it, in Christ's name we pray, amen.
