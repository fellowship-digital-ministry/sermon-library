1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
17, 1 Samuel chapter number 17, as soon as I mention that passage of Scripture, some

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,760
of you immediately know the context of what we're going to deal with.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,319
1 Samuel 17 is probably one of the most well-known passages of Scripture.

4
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:21,559
In fact, it's this passage of Scripture that records for us the account of David and Goliath.

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:29,040
I remember as a young boy not having any real exposure to church whatsoever, and I remember

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,360
watching various sporting events and hearing commentators make a statement such as this,

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,240
this is your typical David versus Goliath.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,560
I had no idea what that meant, because I did not have the biblical foundation for what

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,479
their reference was, but it is interesting, I'm not that old, I will turn 40 here real

10
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:58,319
soon, but in my lifetime I remember as a young child hearing that type of a statement on

11
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:05,839
national television, that commentators were actually using a biblical reference as a description

12
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,480
of something that was going on.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,199
And of course, we find that our society has progressively become more and more biblically

14
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:20,800
ignorant, that we have more and more people that just as I was biblically ignorant as

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,519
a young person and had no idea of the reference that was being made, we have a large percentage

16
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:35,480
of our population today that would have no concept of really the details that we find

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,199
within the passage of Scripture.

18
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:42,120
Now I always find it difficult to go to a familiar passage of Scripture.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,279
You say, why?

20
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:45,519
Because y'all know the story, amen?

21
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,040
You know the account, you understand what's happened, and if we're not careful, what happens

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,000
is we just tune it off, right?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,559
Because we already know what's going on, we already know the account, we already know

24
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:57,040
it, yep, I know this, so on and so forth.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,639
And if we're not careful, it just becomes a common thing, and we miss what God has for

26
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,639
us.

27
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:08,880
I hope you've read your Bible more than once, amen?

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,039
Let me put it this way.

29
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,119
There are times that Holly makes a meal, many times that Holly makes a meal, and I say something

30
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,559
like this, you should make that again.

31
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,559
Why?

32
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:22,360
Because it was good, right, it makes sense, right?

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,360
And in fact, I'm at the place where, obviously we haven't been to restaurants very often

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,080
in the past several months, but typically, if I go to a restaurant, I find something

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,520
that's good that I like, and then I just stick to it.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,559
Anyone could order for me.

37
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:42,800
If you've been with me to a particular restaurant, if I'm not there, if I have laryngitis, something's

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
going on, you could just go ahead and order for me, because I just get the same thing.

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Why?

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,039
Because I found something that was good, and don't mess with it, right?

41
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,639
Holly's forever trying something new.

42
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,160
She's like, ah, I think I'm going to try this, and then at the end of the meal, I'll say

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
something like this, how was it?

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
She says, ah, it was okay, but I wouldn't get it again.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,839
See, that's not the experience that I want.

46
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,960
That's not the experience that I want to pay for, right, you understand what I'm saying?

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,360
I want to pay for an experience that I say, man, that was the best whatever, that was

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,160
so good, right, I mean, you understand what I'm saying?

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,419
So we understand that in our lives, practically speaking, but sometimes we come to a passage

50
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:22,339
of Scripture that's familiar to us, we just kind of get on autopilot and just kind of

51
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:28,500
miss some things, and this morning, as we look at 1 Samuel 17, I hope that as we look

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,660
at this passage of Scripture, my purpose this morning, or my approach, if I will, this morning

53
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,259
is really to focus on the statements of David.

54
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,860
I want you to focus upon what David says, and as we think about the statements of David

55
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,179
in this passage of Scripture, I believe that it reveals some things to us about David,

56
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:53,419
about his character, about his heart.

57
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,500
It's interesting, as we look at the passage of Scripture, and we understand that David

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,100
at this particular time, he's not the king, he's been anointed to be the king as of chapter

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,860
number 16, but he's not the king at this time.

60
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,580
In fact, a number of years will pass before he will become the king of the nation, and

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,339
we find here that David really is just a young lad, just an older teenager, probably,

62
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,820
as best we can tell.

63
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,299
But it's interesting, because we know David as being the king of Israel, we know him as

64
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:27,260
being the sweet psalmist of Israel, and we know many things about David, and really it's

65
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,859
interesting because David says this in the Psalms, as he would be declaring this truth,

66
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,220
in Psalm 145, it is a psalm that's ascribed to David.

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,660
He says this, I will declare thy greatness.

68
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,140
Psalm 135 is not ascribed to David, though it would seem that perhaps it is David that

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,380
is the human penman.

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,859
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, but it's interesting

71
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:57,619
that in verse number 5 of Psalm 135, the Bible says, for I know that the Lord is great.

72
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,500
We serve a great God.

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,299
And as we look at the passage of Scripture in 1 Samuel 17, and I think about what David

74
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,700
penned in Psalm 145, when he said, I will declare thy greatness.

75
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:21,100
I look at 1 Samuel 17, and I see David in his statements, how his perspective is God-ward.

76
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:28,579
He understands who his God is, he understands what his God is capable of doing, and we find

77
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,100
that in the passage of Scripture, as you focus upon the statements of David, it really reveals

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,660
some things to us.

79
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,420
Let me begin reading just a few verses here, we'll dig right in.

80
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,100
Verse number 20 of 1 Samuel 17, the Bible says, And David rose up early in the morning,

81
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,179
and left the sheep with a keeper, and took and went, as Jesse had commanded him.

82
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:53,299
And he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for

83
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:54,299
the battle.

84
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:58,339
It's interesting that right away in verse number 20, as David is fulfilling the responsibilities

85
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:02,899
that have been given to him from his father, of course, we jumped in kind of midway into

86
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,019
the passage.

87
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,779
The children of Israel are at battle against the Philistines, Jesse says, David, take these

88
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,140
things and go see how your brethren fare, so on and so forth.

89
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,579
And just in verse number 20, we find that the Bible reveals to us that David is punctual.

90
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,899
He rose up early in the morning, we see that he's responsible, that he left the sheep with

91
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,420
a keeper, and we see that he was obedient.

92
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,420
And what a blessing to see the character of David being revealed to us immediately as

93
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,179
he would rise up to go and fulfill the responsibility that was given to him from his father.

94
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:40,339
We find that, skip down if you will, and we're going to come back and catch all these verses,

95
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,260
but skip down to verse 45, I'll give you the title.

96
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,779
Notice this, this is one of the statements that we're going to look into and dig into

97
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,859
this morning.

98
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:53,660
Verse 45, Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a

99
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,700
spear, and with a shield.

100
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:05,540
But I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,

101
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,820
whom thou hast defied.

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,700
I've taken the title from verse number 45 this morning, and I've simply used part of

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,540
the phrase, I come in the name of the Lord.

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,179
You think about the New Testament principle in Ephesians chapter number six, be strong

105
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:23,200
in the Lord and the power of his might.

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,320
We understand that Paul says very plainly as he's speaking to the believers in Corinth

107
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,679
that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, right, they're spiritual.

108
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:38,040
And we understand that here as David would make one of these declarations, he says, I

109
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,320
come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.

110
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,820
As we look at the passage of scripture, first notice with me the problem they faced.

111
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,760
Notice first of all the problem they faced.

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,160
We're familiar with the passage again, and we understand that they were facing a great

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
difficulty.

114
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
In verse number 21, to pick back up where we are, the Bible says, for Israel and the

115
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,679
Philistines had put the battle at Array, army against army.

116
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:07,559
David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army

117
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,720
and came and saluted his brethren.

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,480
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath,

119
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,160
Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same

120
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,519
words, and notice this phrase, and David heard them.

121
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,959
And David heard them.

122
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,160
It's interesting to me that as David fulfills the responsibility that had been given to

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,119
him from his father, he comes and he arrives and there's greetings that are exchanged according

124
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:42,679
to what we find in verse 22 and 23, and as they're speaking, as he talked with them,

125
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:50,559
the Bible tells us that Goliath comes out, he appears, and he defies the armies of God.

126
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,039
Notice with me, if you go back in our text of Scripture to verse number 9, the Bible

127
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,719
says, actually go back to verse number 8, it says, and he stood and cried, this is Goliath,

128
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:04,000
he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them, why are ye come out to

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,799
set your battle in Array?

130
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,119
Am not I a Philistine, and ye servants of Saul?

131
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,679
Notice what he says, choose you a man for you and let him come down to me.

132
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,440
If he be able to fight with me and to kill me, then will we be your servants.

133
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,599
But if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall ye be our servants and serve us.

134
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:32,799
The Bible tells us in verse number 10, the Philistines said, I defy the armies of Israel

135
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,119
this day, give me a man that we may fight together.

136
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,919
It's interesting, as the Bible gives us the challenge as it's given to us here in these

137
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:49,520
verses, we understand that Goliath was a stature, the stature of this man was huge, he was about

138
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,520
9 feet 9 inches tall, he was a very large man, a very successful warrior, in fact, later

139
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,080
in our passage, we understand that Saul says, hey David, I understand you're

140
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,120
and you're volunteering, but you're not able.

141
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,720
This man, he's been a man of war since his youth,

142
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,640
and we understand the testimony, if you will,

143
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,820
if we use that word of Goliath

144
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,000
and we think about the way in which

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,440
this man is now defying.

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,200
And he says very simply,

147
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,540
I defy the armies of Israel this day.

148
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,600
Now this is what David heard.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,780
Because it tells us in verse number 23

150
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,400
that he spake according to the same words,

151
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,920
and David heard them.

152
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,520
And David heard them.

153
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,640
I wonder, as we look at the passage

154
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,800
and we begin to dig in,

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
we understand how David responds,

156
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,520
but I want you to be mindful of the response

157
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,080
of the people outside of David.

158
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,040
See, this was a serious problem

159
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,220
that they were facing.

160
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,760
The Bible says in verse number 11,

161
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,680
when Saul and all Israel

162
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
heard those words of the Philistine,

163
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,640
what did they do?

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,560
They were dismayed and greatly afraid.

165
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,340
Saul, he stood head and shoulders

166
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,500
above all the others.

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,100
Is that not right?

168
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,940
That's one of the reasons

169
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,780
from the human perspective of the nation of Israel

170
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,960
that Saul was selected to be the king.

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,660
And we understand that as we look

172
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,340
at the passage of Scripture,

173
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,580
that the Bible says that they were dismayed

174
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,740
and greatly afraid.

175
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,800
David hears these words in verse number 23,

176
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,960
and we find that the Bible tells us

177
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,120
that as David is standing there and hearing them,

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,760
that the other men of Israel hear,

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,200
and notice what it says,

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,560
and what's the next word in verse number 24?

181
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,680
And all the men of Israel,

182
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,800
when they saw the man,

183
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,260
who's the man?

184
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,280
Goliath.

185
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,600
They fled from him and were sore afraid.

186
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
They fled from him.

187
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,420
They were sore afraid.

188
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,980
It's interesting as we think about

189
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,140
the response of the nation of Israel

190
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,840
and we think about these individuals.

191
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
Listen, these were men that had been

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,640
experienced in fighting.

193
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,680
These were the armies of Israel.

194
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
These were men that had experienced victory

195
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,180
even in their own lives

196
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,380
as they had battled in the past.

197
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,600
And we find that for the nation of Israel,

198
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,940
they're now in this place

199
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,060
where they hear Goliath

200
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,340
and they hear these words

201
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,480
and they're fearful.

202
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,380
The Bible tells us that they fled.

203
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,500
They were sore afraid.

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,840
It told us in verse number 11

205
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,660
that they were greatly afraid.

206
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,880
Remember, God said this

207
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,340
as Paul was speaking to Timothy,

208
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,500
for God hath not given us the spirit of fear,

209
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,940
but of power and of love

210
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,900
and of a sound mind.

211
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,020
See, the reality is that all of the army,

212
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,520
all of the men of Israel,

213
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,120
they all were fearful

214
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,740
because there was something missing

215
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,960
in the lives of those individuals

216
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,540
that was present in the life of David.

217
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,580
See, there was something distinctly different

218
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,240
about David than all of these other men

219
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,300
that were there.

220
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,260
Oh, was it that he was a greater warrior?

221
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,240
Oh, was it that he was more experienced?

222
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,600
No. He's probably younger than most of them.

223
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
We know that he's speaking to his brothers

224
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,520
and we know that all of his brothers

225
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,060
are older than him.

226
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,180
Amen?

227
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,960
And you have the youngest one now coming.

228
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,060
David, he's fulfilling the responsibility.

229
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
We could ask ourselves this morning,

230
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
why was David in that place?

231
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,600
Because his dad told him to go.

232
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,520
He was obedient.

233
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
See, when we're where God leads us,

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,760
we find that God will use us.

235
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,520
Oh, we may face some oppositions.

236
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
We may face some challenges.

237
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,080
We may face some difficulties.

238
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
We find that as soon as David gets there,

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,700
they're really sharing pleasantries.

240
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,280
I mean, greeting one another.

241
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
And as they're greeting one another,

242
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
he hears Goliath come out

243
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,740
and make these statements.

244
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,960
And we notice the problem they face.

245
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,580
This is a serious problem.

246
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,860
This problem wasn't going away any time soon.

247
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,540
We understand that throughout much of the history,

248
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,160
especially of David, Saul,

249
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,220
as that period of history for the nation of Israel,

250
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,640
the Philistines were their consistent foe.

251
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,600
I mean, they consistently were in battle

252
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
one with the other, one with the other.

253
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,300
And you see that we find that this problem

254
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,360
was not going to go.

255
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,560
Goliath had defied the armies of Israel.

256
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,180
Goliath had come and he had given the challenge

257
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,160
and we find the problem was serious.

258
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,680
Listen, the reality this morning

259
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,520
is that we don't seek to pretend

260
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,560
that the problem doesn't exist.

261
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,240
There are problems that we face.

262
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,400
There are challenges and obstacles.

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,200
We studied in the book of Joshua,

264
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,020
as you deal with the inheritance

265
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,080
and all that was going on

266
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,600
and as they were dividing the land.

267
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,720
And one of the lessons that we had recently,

268
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,200
we dealt with the latter part of chapter number 17

269
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,320
with the sons of Joseph,

270
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,060
when they said, this land isn't enough for us.

271
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,180
We're a great people.

272
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,280
We need more.

273
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,760
And Joshua gives them good counsel.

274
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,700
Joshua provides them with direction,

275
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,780
but they say, oh, well,

276
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,800
you understand that the Anakims are there.

277
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
I mean, there's great people there.

278
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,900
The Canaanites are there and these, excuse me,

279
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,600
I said Anakims, I meant Canaanites.

280
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
The Canaanites are there.

281
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,640
They're great people.

282
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,320
They have chariots of iron.

283
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,040
Joshua didn't deny any of that.

284
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,340
Joshua just let them know that God was greater.

285
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,160
See, we don't deny that the opposition is there.

286
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,560
On Wednesday evening,

287
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,320
we dealt with the passage of Scripture there

288
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
in the book of Nehemiah.

289
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,240
And as we dealt with the book of Nehemiah

290
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,200
and we dealt with the fact that there are many adversaries,

291
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,840
the reality is that you never see Nehemiah

292
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,560
going to the people and saying,

293
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,720
oh, they're not really against us.

294
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,280
No, no, the problem was serious, right?

295
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,420
We face problems in our lives.

296
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,860
We face problems as a society, as a nation.

297
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,900
We face problems.

298
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,600
And we see that the nation of Israel

299
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,060
at this particular time, they had a serious problem.

300
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,940
We wanna focus this morning on the remainder of our time

301
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,320
on this thought, number two, if you're taking notes.

302
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,820
We notice the problem they face,

303
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,220
but now consider the perspective of David.

304
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm gonna walk through the passage of Scripture

305
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,260
and I'm gonna highlight the statements

306
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,900
that David makes as we go through the passage.

307
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,260
And we'll find beginning in verse number 26.

308
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
It's the first statement that we see.

309
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Remember, in verse number 24,

310
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,620
the Bible told us that the men of Israel,

311
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,500
all the men of Israel, when they saw the man,

312
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
when they saw Goliath, they fled from him,

313
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,180
they were sore afraid.

314
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,580
The men of Israel said, notice in verse 25,

315
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,660
have you seen this man that has come up?

316
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,020
Surely to defy Israel has he come up,

317
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,860
and it shall be that the man who killeth him,

318
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,940
the king shall enrich or will enrich him with great riches

319
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,180
and will give him his daughter

320
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,080
and make his father's house free in Israel.

321
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,320
I want you to consider,

322
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,760
even as we begin looking at the perspective of David,

323
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,600
it's important for us to consider the perspective

324
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,640
of the people in verse number 25.

325
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,200
What is their perspective?

326
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,120
Notice what they say.

327
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,640
Have you seen this man that has come up?

328
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
What are they focused on?

329
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,720
The problem.

330
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,400
They're focused on Goliath, right?

331
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,960
They're focused on, have you seen him?

332
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,680
I mean, look at how big he is.

333
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,360
Look at how powerful he is.

334
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
What's their focus?

335
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,080
Their focus is their problem.

336
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
The focus is their problem.

337
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
If we're not careful, we focus on the problem.

338
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,000
You remember the passage of Scripture

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,480
in the book of Exodus when they're leaving Egypt.

340
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,400
Exodus chapter number 14 gives us the record

341
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,960
of the crossing of the Red Sea.

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
The Red Sea is before them.

343
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,080
The Egyptians are behind them.

344
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,240
If you look at the passage of Scripture,

345
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,360
the Bible tells us that the people said.

346
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,320
What did the people say?

347
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
Would you bring us here to die?

348
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,680
We're gonna die.

349
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
There's no way out.

350
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Moses said, because God said,

351
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,080
stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.

352
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,400
See, it's a matter of perspective.

353
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
And we find that in this passage of Scripture,

354
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,720
the men, all of these soldiers, the army of Israel,

355
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,560
their perspective is on their problem.

356
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Can I tell you that when we focus on the problem

357
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,160
long enough, it gets bigger, right?

358
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,880
I mean, we just keep focusing on it

359
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,440
and it just keeps, it just got our attention.

360
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,680
But look at David, verse 26,

361
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,720
the first statement that he makes.

362
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
And David spake to the men that stood by him.

363
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,920
Now, can you imagine this?

364
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,200
I mean, maybe we could do some role play this morning

365
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,840
figuratively, because we can't move around

366
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
and all that sort of thing.

367
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,360
But let's just say that this morning,

368
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm standing over here.

369
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,480
I got Armando and Mark and I got Rick and I got Michael

370
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
and I got these guys over here and we're standing here

371
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,080
and we're talking about something that has to happen

372
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,799
and we're like, man, I just have no idea

373
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,920
how we're gonna do this.

374
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,880
And it's just, it's not gonna be possible

375
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,200
and we're just looking at the problem.

376
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,320
And then Joseph comes over and says,

377
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,280
hey, guys, did you consider?

378
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,119
And we're like, who is this?

379
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,040
What is, this is a men's conversation, right?

380
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,480
I mean, David's the youngest.

381
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,160
David's probably, like I said, an older teenager

382
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
at this particular time in his life, as best we can tell.

383
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,239
And we find that he comes and he spake to the men.

384
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm thankful that David had some courage.

385
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm thankful that David was willing to go

386
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
and speak to these men and give them a perspective of faith.

387
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,320
Notice it says, what shall be done to the man

388
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,559
that killeth the Philistine

389
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,239
and taketh away the reproach of Israel?

390
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,080
They had mentioned that in verse 25,

391
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,559
but notice at the end of verse number 26,

392
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
for who is this uncircumcised Philistine

393
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,720
that he should defy the armies of the living God?

394
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
Y'all are focused on this guy and saying,

395
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,520
have you seen him?

396
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,400
But I wanna ask you a question.

397
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,920
Who is he that he should defy the armies of the living God?

398
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,440
We begin to see immediately in verse number 26,

399
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,840
the perspective of David is quite different

400
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
than the perspective of the army.

401
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,440
As we continue through the.

402
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,760
passage, we find in verse 27 that the people answered him after this manner

403
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,800
saying, so shall it be done to the man that killeth him. Is it not interesting

404
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,600
that as they respond to David, they only answer the first question and not the

405
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,200
second question? The first question was, what shall be done to the man that

406
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,480
killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel? The second

407
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,600
question is, who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the

408
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,760
armies of the Living God? And the people answered him after this manner saying, so

409
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,040
shall it be done to the man that killeth him. And Eliab, his eldest brother, now if

410
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,440
you got some siblings, see we got the Trejos over here, they got all kinds of

411
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,520
siblings, amen? Perfect. Sam, you're the oldest one that's here this morning, all

412
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,760
right? But David's the oldest. But notice Eliab is gonna say something to his

413
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,000
little brother, so we could do some role play again, right? And you see one of the

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,800
younger brothers saying, come on, we can do this, and Sam's like, shut up, boy.

415
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,360
Like, what are you doing? Right? And we see it, right? With sibling rivalry, right? I

416
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
only had one brother, I'm the oldest. I could smack him around a little bit when

417
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,959
we're younger, now he's bigger and stronger than I am, and so I talk nice to

418
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:16,959
him, amen? But the reality is that in verse 28 it says that his oldest brother

419
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:22,440
says this, he said, in Eliab, verse 28, his eldest brother heard when he's speaking

420
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,000
to the men, and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, why

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,360
camest thou down hither? And with whom hast thou let those few sheep in the

422
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,639
wilderness? Well, David was responsible, we already mentioned that. He left him

423
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:41,279
with a keeper. The reason that he was there is because his dad sent him. But

424
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:50,480
notice what Eliab says, I know thy pride. Really? Really? And the naughtiness of

425
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,200
thine heart, for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. We see

426
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,639
David speaking again in verse 29. It's probably one of the most famous

427
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:08,760
references of David's words from this passage of Scripture. He says, what have

428
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:16,199
I now done? Is there not a cause? Is there not a cause? We've mentioned that

429
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:21,279
phraseology in many various settings over the past, and you find, again, that's

430
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,520
a very familiar reference to this passage. We find it in verse number 30

431
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,800
that he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner. The

432
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,559
people answered him again after the former manner. And when the words were

433
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,080
heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul, and he sent for him. And

434
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,600
David said to Saul, notice again the statements of David here in verse

435
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,199
number 32, David said to Saul, notice what he says, let no man's heart fail

436
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,680
because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. Isn't that

437
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:59,000
awesome? I mean, David, he heard what Goliath said. David saw how the army

438
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,720
responded. He saw how they were greatly afraid. They were sore afraid. And the

439
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,000
Bible tells us that when David is in the presence of Saul, he says, Saul, let no

440
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,000
man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this

441
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,119
Philistine. He just volunteered. I love it. The courage. See, we're beginning to see

442
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,680
the perspective of David through these statements, and it's gonna lead up, all of

443
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,119
these statements culminate to the latter statements that we read right before the

444
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,680
battle between David and Goliath. It's a very quick battle, obviously, but

445
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,600
right before it, really, they engage one with another, and we see how all of these

446
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,240
statements are leading up to that perspective that is a Godward

447
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,559
perspective. Notice that David volunteers, and Saul then responds to David in

448
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,880
verse 33, thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him.

449
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,000
Thou art not able. I just, for a moment of time, I want to think about Saul for just

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,600
a moment. He's the king, right? He's the king of Israel. How many other volunteers

451
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:14,279
did he have? Nobody. So now you finally get a volunteer, and you say, yeah, thanks

452
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,519
for the offer, but no, you're not able. I mean, think about that. Saul has no other

453
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,760
options. He's got no options here. David is coming, and we see his perspective.

454
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,839
He's saying, let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and

455
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,640
fight with this Philistine, and Saul says, nope, you're not able. Here's why you're

456
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,679
not able. For thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. Saul

457
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,640
objected to the volunteer of David. Saul said, it's just not going to work. I mean,

458
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,679
Saul could see the end, and in his mind, it was not a good situation. In his mind,

459
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,880
it was certain that if David were the one to go and battle against Goliath,

460
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,600
that it would mean bad things for the nation. He was looking again. What's his

461
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,720
perspective? It's a horizontal plane perspective, right? It's a looking at

462
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,959
somebody and what you think their capabilities are versus looking at the

463
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:22,519
opposition and what their capabilities are without any acknowledge of what God

464
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:32,239
is able to do, right? Here, the conversation continues. In verses 34 down through

465
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,160
verse number 37, David begins to rehearse some things to Saul. As he

466
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,239
rehearses these things to Saul, we find that he is remembering what God has done,

467
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:48,399
which gives him faith for what God will do. Notice in verse 34, and David said

468
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,160
unto Saul, thy servant kept his father's sheep. And there came a lion and a bear

469
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,000
and took a lamb out of the flock. And then it says this in verse 35, and I went

470
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,200
out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth. Now, can

471
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:18,119
you imagine Saul hearing this? I look at David saying this and I think about

472
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,760
David. He's not being prideful in saying this. He's simply rehearsing what has

473
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,679
happened in his life. He's rehearsing what God had done, which gave him faith

474
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,000
for what God will do. And he says there's a lion. Now, I've seen lions from a

475
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,239
distance. They're powerful. I have no desire to jump into a lion cage. You know,

476
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:39,360
these people, they get real close and I want to jump in and all this stuff. I have

477
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,519
no interest, no desire whatsoever to do that. I'm not really interested in going

478
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,839
on a safari and seeing all these lions climb up all over the vehicle. Then I'm

479
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,360
just not interested. And we find that David notices the immediate response

480
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,720
that he says that when that that lion came and took a lamb out of the flock

481
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,920
that he went out after him. He went after him. You say, well, what would you do? I'd

482
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,000
probably count it a loss. I mean, well, you probably would too. Let's be honest.

483
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,720
Amen? You're like, man, that's a shame. He's gonna have a good meal. I mean,

484
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:28,720
seriously. Not David. He rose up, went after him. Notice what it says. When he

485
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:41,440
arose against me, I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him. Wow.

486
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:52,959
Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear. Notice what he says. Verse 36. And

487
00:27:52,959 --> 00:28:03,679
this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the

488
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,920
armies of the living God. The perspective is Godward. Notice verse 37. David said,

489
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,160
moreover, he's not done yet. He shared what God has done, which gives him faith

490
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,279
and courage for what God will do. And notice how plainly he puts it in verse

491
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,959
37. The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the

492
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:34,000
bear. Notice this phrase. He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and

493
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,280
Saul said unto David, go and the Lord be with thee. Again, we see the courage and

494
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,159
perspective of David through these statements that he makes. He says, Saul,

495
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:54,359
let me just give you a little bit of my history. Let me inform you of what

496
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,919
happened when I was taking care of some of the flock. And he says, moreover, I want

497
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,520
you to understand that the Lord that delivered, right? He doesn't take the

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,440
the recognition for himself. He doesn't say because of my... No, he says the Lord

499
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,239
that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, out of the paw of the bear. He will

500
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:23,640
deliver me. It's interesting what Saul says. He went from thou art not able to

501
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,320
go and the Lord be with thee. It's interesting as to why Saul might respond

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,679
the way that he did. I think that Saul understood the genuineness of David. I

503
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:41,840
think that he saw the heart of David. That David believed with certainty that

504
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,760
God was able and what God was going to do. See, I don't see David as being a

505
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,239
double-minded man. I don't see David as being wavering in his faith. I don't see

506
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,679
David sitting up there all timid and saying, well, I think maybe if we could

507
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,359
maybe... No, no. David's like just, here's my God.

508
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,739
God.

509
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:05,859
Here's what my God is able to do.

510
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:09,199
Here's what my God has done in my life.

511
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:14,139
And you think that I'm scared of this Goliath because he's nine feet, nine inches tall,

512
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:17,219
because he has all of the armor that he has?

513
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:20,939
That's nothing compared to my God.

514
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:22,779
Because my God is able.

515
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,059
Because I've seen my God work.

516
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:30,259
I mean, look at the statements of David.

517
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,679
And look at his perspective.

518
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:39,059
And we find that now in verse number 38, that Saul then arms David with his armor, put a

519
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,339
helmet of brass upon his head.

520
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,999
Also he armed him with a coat of mail, and David girded a sword upon his armor.

521
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,939
In verse 39, in a sade to go, it says this, for he had not proved it.

522
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:53,899
David, again, we see a statement here at the end of verse number 39, and David said unto

523
00:30:53,899 --> 00:31:01,219
Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved them, and David put them off him.

524
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:06,419
The Bible doesn't tell us necessarily what the response of the people that observed this.

525
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,859
But I just wonder if there's somebody saying, that guy's crazy.

526
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:13,859
I mean, he's not even taking armor with him.

527
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:14,859
He wasn't crazy.

528
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:21,219
He had his eyes on God.

529
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:25,339
He understood that God said, let there be light.

530
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,399
And there was light.

531
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,979
He understood that God spoke everything into existence.

532
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:37,579
And no doubt in my mind, David had heard about the Red Sea.

533
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,499
No doubt in my mind that David had heard about the Jordan River.

534
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:45,519
No doubt in my mind that David had heard about what happened at Jericho and Ai, and you fill

535
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,199
in the blank of all of the conquering of the land.

536
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,059
David had heard those things.

537
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,659
David understood what God was able to do.

538
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,059
And David was looking at God.

539
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,859
We find in verse number 40, it says, he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth

540
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:03,299
stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag, which he had evened in his

541
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,299
script.

542
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,819
And a sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.

543
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,879
The Philistine came on and drew near unto David, and in verse number 41, the man that

544
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,179
bare the shield went before him.

545
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:16,419
I've never understood why someone had to go before Goliath if he was so great.

546
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,419
Honestly.

547
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:23,299
It says in verse 42, and when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him,

548
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,059
for he was but a youth and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

549
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,979
Notice, the Philistine says, am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?

550
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:37,019
The Philistine cursed David by his gods.

551
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:42,099
Verse 44, the Philistine said to David, come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the

552
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:45,499
fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

553
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:53,619
Pride, arrogance, but can I tell you from a human perspective, what Goliath was saying

554
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:54,619
was true.

555
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,539
Goliath was a man of war from his youth.

556
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,939
Goliath, no doubt in my mind, had killed many people.

557
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:02,939
Right?

558
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,779
He'd been the victor.

559
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,539
He's called the champion of the Philistines.

560
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,259
You don't get that title because you've been sitting on the couch.

561
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,499
Amen?

562
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,059
He's been in some battles.

563
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:21,379
He's gone through some things, and he looks, remember, he gave the challenge in the beginning

564
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:24,619
of the passage, choose you a man for him and let him come down to me.

565
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:28,419
I almost see Goliath saying, that's the best you've got?

566
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,139
Like seriously?

567
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:33,839
We've been dealing with this and I've been defying you and that's the best you can come

568
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,379
up with?

569
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,379
This is the mind of Goliath.

570
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:41,859
Goliath says, here's what I'm going to do, come on, I'm going to tear you up and I'm

571
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,379
going to feed your flesh to the fowls.

572
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,979
So he says, another statement of David in verse number 45.

573
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:53,419
Another statement that reveals to us the perspective.

574
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:59,939
David said to the Philistine, thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear, with

575
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:07,819
a shield, but I, I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies

576
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:11,219
of Israel whom thou hast defied.

577
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,699
He makes it known, plain and clear.

578
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:19,339
Here's how you're coming, but here's how I'm coming.

579
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:26,419
Verse 46, this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand.

580
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,939
He'd already said that to Saul, had he not?

581
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:32,859
He said to Saul, verse number 37, the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion,

582
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:36,779
out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine.

583
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:43,539
And so David is now, they're facing one another, there's some distance between them, we understand

584
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,339
because of what's going to happen in just a few verses.

585
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:50,899
And Goliath has said some things to David and David said, listen, I want you to understand

586
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,859
that you're coming to me with this sword and this spear and this shield, but I'm coming

587
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,979
to you in the name of the Lord of hosts.

588
00:34:56,979 --> 00:35:04,659
And I want you to understand that this day will the Lord deliver thine hand, thee into

589
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:06,599
mine hand.

590
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,159
He doesn't stop there.

591
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:16,799
He says, I will smite thee and I will take thine head from thee and I will give the carcasses

592
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:21,759
of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast

593
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,399
of the earth.

594
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:33,719
Notice what he says, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

595
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:39,399
David wasn't interested in being known as the champion of the Israelites.

596
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:42,599
Goliath was known as the champion of the Philistines.

597
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,399
David didn't ask for the women in chapter number 18 that sang his praise that Saul had

598
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:51,959
slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.

599
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,439
David wasn't seeking for that.

600
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,919
That's not what David wanted.

601
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:59,439
We understand that Saul, that really messed Saul up.

602
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:07,459
Another message entirely, but we understand that David, his perspective, the whole motive

603
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:14,239
was that all the earth may know that there's a God in Israel.

604
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,279
That all the earth may know there's a God in Israel.

605
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:25,879
David says, you know what, when you look at it on paper, you should win.

606
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:29,199
But you forgot to understand what God is able to do.

607
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,119
You forgot to understand what God is able to do.

608
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:39,039
I read verse number 46 in our Bibles and I read that verse and I just say, what faith,

609
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,039
what courage.

610
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,439
Here's what God's going to do, 100%.

611
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:48,239
I mean, he's just absolutely 100% convinced this is what God's going to do.

612
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,239
Why?

613
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,239
Because he knew who God was.

614
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,479
See, he said, I will declare thy greatness in Psalm 145.

615
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,479
In Psalm 135, I know that the Lord is great.

616
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:03,439
If you know that God is great, it's going to lead to you declaring his greatness.

617
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:07,979
You're going to begin to operate, live your life with the understanding that you serve

618
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:11,000
a great God.

619
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,359
Verse 47, and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear,

620
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:25,959
for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands.

621
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:31,199
It came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David.

622
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,719
I love verse number 48.

623
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,619
It says that David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

624
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,319
There was no back and down.

625
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:45,000
This wasn't David trying to just talk some kind of a talk and come to a place where maybe

626
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,919
I will intimidate this giant, this Philistine, to not want to have battle because I'm going

627
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:54,159
to just talk a talk and I'm going to scare him and he's going to leave.

628
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,159
No, no.

629
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,759
David runs right after him.

630
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,719
This is, we're going to see what God's going to do.

631
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,839
The Bible continues, again, familiar passage of Scripture.

632
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:08,679
Notice verse 49, David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and swang it and

633
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:12,319
smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell

634
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,799
upon his face to the earth.

635
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:19,359
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine

636
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,799
and slew him.

637
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,319
There was no sword in the hand of David.

638
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,319
Why?

639
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,319
Because he said, I have not proved them.

640
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,679
He didn't take it.

641
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,679
So what do you do?

642
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,959
Verse 51, therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew

643
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:37,159
it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith.

644
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,719
And when the Philistine saw their champion was dead, they fled.

645
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,159
Yeah, I guess so.

646
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,919
We see the perspective of David.

647
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,679
We consider the perspective of David.

648
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,159
We've read the statements of what David says.

649
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,359
And we've understood some things about the heart of David.

650
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,359
See, all of the army was fearful.

651
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,799
They were so afraid.

652
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,919
They heard the words and they went and they retreated.

653
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:08,919
They were hiding.

654
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:10,159
They were fearful.

655
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,559
But David heard the words and says, hold on guys, who is this uncircumcised Philistine

656
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,119
that he should defy the armies of the living God?

657
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,479
Hold on guys, is there not a cause?

658
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,479
Hold on.

659
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:21,479
I want you to understand, Saul.

660
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,479
Here's what God did.

661
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,519
There was a lion, there was a bear and God delivered him out of my hand.

662
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,399
And so will he deliver this Philistine into my hand.

663
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,519
I want you to understand, Goliath, I've heard what you've said, but I want you to understand

664
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,760
that you're coming with sword and shield and spear, but I'm coming in the name of the Lord

665
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
of hosts.

666
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,799
I want you to understand that I'm going to, the Lord's going to deliver you into my hand

667
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,799
today.

668
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,760
Do you think that you're going to kill me and feed my carcass to the fowls of the air?

669
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,039
I want you to understand there, Goliath, that God's going to deliver you into my hand

670
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,200
and it's your carcass that's going to be eaten by these fowls.

671
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,959
Man, what a perspective.

672
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,359
It's a God-ward perspective.

673
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:09,719
perspective. Remember, all the army, when they heard, what did they say? Have you seen

674
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:16,019
this Philistine? Right? What are they looking at? The problem. Looking at the problem. They

675
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:21,379
have no solution for the problem, by the way, because they know that in and of themselves,

676
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:27,099
and that's all they had, they weren't having that Godward perspective, they had no opportunity,

677
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:35,399
no chance. I mean, it was, they were afraid. But those same men, the same army, because

678
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:44,939
David had a perspective that was Godward, because David had courage and faith, he influenced

679
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:51,259
the army. In verse number 52 of our text, the Bible says, and the men of Israel and

680
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:58,859
of Judah arose. They were fearful. Remember, they were hiding. They heard the words of

681
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:04,939
Goliath and they were so afraid. But now that Goliath was dead, now because they saw the

682
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:11,939
courage and the faith and they saw God's hand at work, now they arise. And the Bible says

683
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:16,939
that they shouted. They pursued the Philistines until they come to the valley and to the gates

684
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:21,659
of Ekron. And the wound of the Philistines fell down by the way of Sherem, even unto

685
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,619
Gath and unto Ekron. The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines

686
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,179
and they spoiled their tents. Now, all of a sudden, they want to get involved in what's

687
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:38,419
going on. But I want you to think about the situation here. Again, it's a familiar passage

688
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:44,859
of Scripture. They faced a problem. There was a problem they had. And it was a real

689
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:52,099
problem. It wasn't going away anytime soon. And by the way, could God have dealt with

690
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,379
the Philistines some other way? Sure, he could have. We read throughout the Scriptures there

691
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:02,579
are plenty of other ways that God dealt with the enemy. There are times in which God dealt

692
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:06,939
with the enemy, such as what happened during the time of the Assyrians when they came against

693
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:12,159
Hezekiah. Of course, the nation of Israel had been taken captive by the Assyrians. Now

694
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,719
they're going to come to Judah. Hezekiah is the king. And we understand that Rabshakeh,

695
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,359
he's a bad guy. We understand all that's taking place, all of the threats that come. Sennacherib

696
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,839
is the king. And all that's going on. And what does Hezekiah do? Man, he lays that stuff

697
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,439
out before the Lord and he prays and he seeks the face of God. He says, God, I know that

698
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:36,959
you're the creator. I know that you're able. You're the living God. You're holy. I mean,

699
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:41,799
you read the prayer of Hezekiah. It is a powerful prayer. And you find that Isaiah,

700
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:45,759
the prophet, he comes and he says, hey, listen, God's going to take care of them. What'd he

701
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:51,919
do? He sent an angel, took care of them. They didn't have to do a thing. But in 1 Samuel

702
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:58,919
17, God used a man. God used a man. That man was David. We could look at a whole host of

703
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:05,279
other examples this morning. We don't have time. But what I want to say is that there

704
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:10,679
was a problem. And I'm thankful that there was a man that had a proper perspective. A

705
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:16,119
perspective that was Godward. A perspective that understood that my God is bigger. My

706
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,199
God is greater. There was an understanding of the greatness of God and what He is able

707
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:27,159
to do. And instead of just sitting around and joining the round table discussion with

708
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:31,199
Saul and the other generals as to what are we going to do with this Philistine, David

709
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:38,319
just said, I'll go. Don't worry. God's going to deliver him into my hand. This morning,

710
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:50,879
we face problems. Globally, nationally, locally, we face problems. We face problems in our

711
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:58,879
homes. We have personal problems. I mean, it goes from 7.5 billion people, global problems

712
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:08,759
that we have, all the way down to individual problems that we have. Amen? But can I tell

713
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:14,239
you that God's greater than any of them. And what happens far too often is we focus upon

714
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,479
the problem and our perspective is horizontal. We're on that horizontal plane and we're looking

715
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,039
at the problem and it's growing and it's growing and it's growing and it's a bigger problem,

716
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:30,039
bigger problem. There's no way. There's nothing that can happen. There's no solution to this.

717
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:37,039
God. God. And here comes David. I'm thankful that Jesse gave him some orders. I'm coming

718
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:46,239
down. I haven't come down off this platform in four months. Amen? Listen. Jesse followed

719
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:54,239
the Lord and told David to go. David goes and he arrives and it's like, what is going

720
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:05,359
on here? All the discussion I'm hearing is about the problem. Everyone's talking about,

721
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,359
have you seen this giant? I heard what he said. Y'all are afraid. And David just says,

722
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,879
what about God? Who is this uncircumcised villain seeing that he should defy the armies

723
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:24,119
of the living God? Psalm 121, I will lift up my eyes into the hills from whence cometh

724
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,359
my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Listen, what happens

725
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,759
so often in our lives. And if we're not careful, I will be honest and transparent with you

726
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:38,479
this morning. There are times that I've been guilty of this very thing over the last four

727
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:43,759
months. We sit around and we talk about all the problems. And we forget to understand

728
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:49,799
that we have a God that is greater. We have a God who is able to do, listen, I believe

729
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:56,799
Ephesians 3.20. He is able to do exceeding abundantly above. What's the Bible say about

730
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:03,559
every word of God is pure. No one gave God a certain number of words he had to use in

731
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:10,519
the Bible. And God wanted us to understand, is it redundant? Yes, for our good. He's able

732
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,719
to do exceeding abundantly above. Couldn't he just say he's able to do? Yeah, he could

733
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,039
have. But doesn't it help you when you know that he says he's able to do exceedingly,

734
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:27,039
exceeding abundantly above all that you ask or think. Now let me ask you something. Can

735
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:35,039
you think of some great things? We can think of some great things. God's able to do greater.

736
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,719
Sometimes our prayer, we think it's a prayer of faith, but really it's not really proving

737
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:47,719
God. In Malachi, God says prove me. Prove me! Because God is able. God is able. And

738
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:55,719
when we look at the perspective of David in 1 Samuel 17, and we think about all the context

739
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,879
of what's happening, we find something very interesting. David's not talking about the

740
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:09,879
enemy. He's talking about his God. He only references the enemy as it has to deal in

741
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:17,119
relation to what his God is going to do to the enemy. I like that. I like that. I like

742
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,079
that. It helps me. I hope it helps you. See, I have a question. I've asked myself this

743
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,319
week a number of times, and really I was going to preach this message last Sunday, but it

744
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:31,519
was Father's Day and the Lord just didn't give me liberty. And I preached another message

745
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,599
and of course I praise the Lord for that passage in Proverbs 4. I hope it was a blessing to

746
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,079
you. But we look at this and I've really been kind of just musing on this passage of Scripture

747
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:46,279
over the last couple of weeks. The Lord gave it to me and really just revealed some things

748
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:52,719
to me. Yes, I know the passage, but helping me to understand a little bit about the perspective

749
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,599
and be reminded of what's happening. And I came to this conclusion, a question really

750
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,599
in my mind. Why is it that I want God to work? Do I want God to work in our midst so that

751
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:11,599
I can have a level of comfort and return to some sense of normalcy? Or do I want God

752
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,719
to work in our midst so that He alone would be exalted and glorified? Can I tell you there's

753
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,000
a great difference? Sometimes we want God to work because I just want to go back to

754
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,679
normal. I just want to be comforted. I'm tired of the problems. I'm tired of the difficulties.

755
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:43,279
I'm tired of the fill in the blank, right? And I just, God, I need you to work because

756
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:50,279
I don't like this stuff. What's our real motive for wanting God to work? Is it because we

757
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:59,599
want God to be exalted and glorified? If it is, it might mean that there's a Goliath that

758
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:06,599
we have to face. Amen? It may mean that there's a Goliath that we have to face and God will

759
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,760
be exalted and glorified. Remember, what did David say? I want all the earth to know that

760
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,399
there's a God in Israel. How were they going to know? How was the host going to know? Because

761
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:29,399
God was going to use this shepherd boy to kill this champion of the Philistines. And

762
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:33,559
God was going to do it. And God was going to do it in such a way that he alone would

763
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:40,559
be glorified. Look at Psalm 115 and we'll close here. Psalm 115, look at this. Psalm

764
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:48,479
115. The Bible says in verse number one, not unto us, O Lord, not unto us. Not unto us

765
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,320
but unto thy name give glory.

766
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:11,280
for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake. See, I want God to be glorified. Sometimes,

767
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,640
listen, we understand God's always able to work. I believe God's always at work.

768
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,600
Sometimes He may not be working the way that you want Him to work or that I want Him to work,

769
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:30,160
but He's at work. God's working. And we look at the pastor and we say, listen, I want God to be

770
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,800
exalted and glorified. You know, there's a world that needs to know that we have a living God

771
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:44,880
that is able. But if we respond like the army of Israel and we have that fear,

772
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,840
sorely afraid, greatly afraid, and we have that horizontal, plain perspective,

773
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,520
do you know how bad, do you know how, and we just begin to talk about whether it's an individual

774
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,120
problem or a global problem? A whole lot of illustrations we could use of problems.

775
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:11,120
No matter what the problem is, if that's our focus instead of our focus being on God. See,

776
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,920
David didn't deny that there was a problem. He just saw that God was greater. David didn't

777
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,880
deny that Goliath was there. He had to go fight Goliath. But he said, my God is greater.

778
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:30,880
And this morning, I want that perspective. I hope that you want that perspective. Can I tell you

779
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,720
that we're only going to declare His greatness if we know that He's great? The only way you're

780
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,920
going to know He's great is if you get in this book, if you have experience in your life where

781
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,840
God has worked and God has answered prayer. See, God had worked in David's life. God had

782
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:51,920
shown and proven to David His power. David had great courage. These statements of David

783
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,280
encouraged me, and I hope that they encourage you this morning. See, I want to see God work,

784
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:05,120
but not just so that I can be comforted, not just so that I can have some level of normalcy.

785
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,320
I want to see God work so that He would be exalted and glorified.

786
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,080
And it may mean that we have to face a Goliath, but our God's greater. Amen? Do you believe this

787
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,920
morning that God's greater than any problem that you have? I don't want you to answer, but do you

788
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,400
acknowledge at times in your life that sometimes you live and I live like our problems are greater

789
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,120
than God? There are times when we do. We just get so wrapped up in whatever the problem is,

790
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,880
right? Where do we focus during the time of the storm? Master, carest thou not that we perish,

791
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,640
right? Isn't that not what the disciples said? Sometimes we feel like that, right?

792
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,480
Of course God cares, and all He had to do was say,

793
00:52:51,440 --> 00:53:00,240
Peace, be still. And all of their jaws were like, What manner of man is this? He's God.

794
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,720
He's God, and He is able. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us.

795
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,560
We thank you for the testimony of David. I thank you for the statements that we see

796
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,640
recorded here in 1 Samuel 17, how these statements reveal to us His perspective, His character.

797
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,760
They reveal to us a genuine walk with You, Lord. We know that you'd already been anointed to be

798
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,680
the King, and you'd already said things to Samuel with regard to the character of the man that you

799
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,920
had chosen to be the King of Israel. We find that it's Stephen that, as he would preach right

800
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,360
before his death in Acts 7, that he speaks about David being a man after your own heart.

801
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:55,760
God, we thank you for the testimony of David. Lord, I pray that as we look at this passage

802
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,040
of Scripture and think about the statements and what they reveal to us, God, you'd help each and

803
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,320
every one of us to have that upward expectation, that upward perspective, that we would

804
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,720
lift up our eyes into the hills from whence cometh our help, understanding that our help

805
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,160
cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Help us, as we look at our theme for this year in

806
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,839
Hebrews 12, that we would look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, understanding

807
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:31,360
that you are the King of kings, Lord of lords, the great I Am, that you are the Lord God omnipotent,

808
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:37,760
that you reign, that there's nothing beyond your power. God, help us to understand this morning

809
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,480
that there's not one problem that we face, personally or globally, that's too big for you.

810
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:53,279
And God, I pray you'd help us to have a desire such as David's desire to see you work,

811
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,960
not so that anyone would say, oh, look at their faith or look at their courage, but that we

812
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,360
would testify of the greatness of our God. They would know that there's a living God

813
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,760
that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. God, help us to recognize

814
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,160
that if you're going to work in that fashion, there's some Goliaths that we have to face.

815
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,640
Help us, Lord, to go not in the power of our own strength, but help us to go

816
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,679
to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might. Help us to go understanding

817
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,080
our spiritual armor in Ephesians 6. There in 1 Samuel 17, David said, I haven't proven them.

818
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,600
God, thank you in the New Testament that you've given us what our spiritual armor is.

819
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,320
I pray you'd help us to put on the whole armor of God, understand that we are engaged in this battle,

820
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:02,960
that you're greater. No doubt this morning, our audience that's here locally, those that are

821
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:11,360
online, no doubt we have problems. And at times, we may be tempted to believe

822
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,640
that there's no solution to our problems.

823
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:24,880
I kind of see Saul and the army of Israel in that situation prior to David's arrival.

824
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,520
God, I'm so thankful that you are able. Would you work? Thank you for working in my heart.

825
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,720
I pray that you'd work in each individual that's present today, Lord, those that are watching

826
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:52,160
online. Help us, Lord, to have a greater focus upon our God. In the days of difficulty and adversity,

827
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,360
would you help us to look to thee? Have your will and way, and we'll thank you for it. Would you

828
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,040
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano,

829
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,360
and as she does, the altar is open. You can pray in your seat. You can come to the altar if you'd

830
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,240
like. Pray at home, those watching live stream. The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
