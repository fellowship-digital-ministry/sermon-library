00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
17, 1 Samuel chapter number 17, as soon as I mention that passage of Scripture, some

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.760
of you immediately know the context of what we're going to deal with.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.319
1 Samuel 17 is probably one of the most well-known passages of Scripture.

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:21.559
In fact, it's this passage of Scripture that records for us the account of David and Goliath.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:29.040
I remember as a young boy not having any real exposure to church whatsoever, and I remember

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.360
watching various sporting events and hearing commentators make a statement such as this,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.240
this is your typical David versus Goliath.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.560
I had no idea what that meant, because I did not have the biblical foundation for what

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.479
their reference was, but it is interesting, I'm not that old, I will turn 40 here real

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:58.319
soon, but in my lifetime I remember as a young child hearing that type of a statement on

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:05.839
national television, that commentators were actually using a biblical reference as a description

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:08.480
of something that was going on.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.199
And of course, we find that our society has progressively become more and more biblically

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:20.800
ignorant, that we have more and more people that just as I was biblically ignorant as

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.519
a young person and had no idea of the reference that was being made, we have a large percentage

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:35.480
of our population today that would have no concept of really the details that we find

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.199
within the passage of Scripture.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:42.120
Now I always find it difficult to go to a familiar passage of Scripture.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.279
You say, why?

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.519
Because y'all know the story, amen?

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:50.040
You know the account, you understand what's happened, and if we're not careful, what happens

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.000
is we just tune it off, right?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.559
Because we already know what's going on, we already know the account, we already know

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.040
it, yep, I know this, so on and so forth.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.639
And if we're not careful, it just becomes a common thing, and we miss what God has for

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:03.639
us.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:08.880
I hope you've read your Bible more than once, amen?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.039
Let me put it this way.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.119
There are times that Holly makes a meal, many times that Holly makes a meal, and I say something

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.559
like this, you should make that again.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.559
Why?

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.360
Because it was good, right, it makes sense, right?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.360
And in fact, I'm at the place where, obviously we haven't been to restaurants very often

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.080
in the past several months, but typically, if I go to a restaurant, I find something

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.520
that's good that I like, and then I just stick to it.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.559
Anyone could order for me.

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:42.800
If you've been with me to a particular restaurant, if I'm not there, if I have laryngitis, something's

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.080
going on, you could just go ahead and order for me, because I just get the same thing.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.080
Why?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.039
Because I found something that was good, and don't mess with it, right?

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.639
Holly's forever trying something new.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.160
She's like, ah, I think I'm going to try this, and then at the end of the meal, I'll say

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.800
something like this, how was it?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.000
She says, ah, it was okay, but I wouldn't get it again.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.839
See, that's not the experience that I want.

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.960
That's not the experience that I want to pay for, right, you understand what I'm saying?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.360
I want to pay for an experience that I say, man, that was the best whatever, that was

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.160
so good, right, I mean, you understand what I'm saying?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.419
So we understand that in our lives, practically speaking, but sometimes we come to a passage

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.339
of Scripture that's familiar to us, we just kind of get on autopilot and just kind of

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:28.500
miss some things, and this morning, as we look at 1 Samuel 17, I hope that as we look

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.660
at this passage of Scripture, my purpose this morning, or my approach, if I will, this morning

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.259
is really to focus on the statements of David.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:42.860
I want you to focus upon what David says, and as we think about the statements of David

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.179
in this passage of Scripture, I believe that it reveals some things to us about David,

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.419
about his character, about his heart.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.500
It's interesting, as we look at the passage of Scripture, and we understand that David

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.100
at this particular time, he's not the king, he's been anointed to be the king as of chapter

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.860
number 16, but he's not the king at this time.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.580
In fact, a number of years will pass before he will become the king of the nation, and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.339
we find here that David really is just a young lad, just an older teenager, probably,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.820
as best we can tell.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.299
But it's interesting, because we know David as being the king of Israel, we know him as

00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:27.260
being the sweet psalmist of Israel, and we know many things about David, and really it's

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.859
interesting because David says this in the Psalms, as he would be declaring this truth,

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:37.220
in Psalm 145, it is a psalm that's ascribed to David.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.660
He says this, I will declare thy greatness.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.140
Psalm 135 is not ascribed to David, though it would seem that perhaps it is David that

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.380
is the human penman.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.859
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, but it's interesting

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:57.619
that in verse number 5 of Psalm 135, the Bible says, for I know that the Lord is great.

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:00.500
We serve a great God.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.299
And as we look at the passage of Scripture in 1 Samuel 17, and I think about what David

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.700
penned in Psalm 145, when he said, I will declare thy greatness.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:21.100
I look at 1 Samuel 17, and I see David in his statements, how his perspective is God-ward.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.579
He understands who his God is, he understands what his God is capable of doing, and we find

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:33.100
that in the passage of Scripture, as you focus upon the statements of David, it really reveals

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.660
some things to us.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.420
Let me begin reading just a few verses here, we'll dig right in.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.100
Verse number 20 of 1 Samuel 17, the Bible says, And David rose up early in the morning,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.179
and left the sheep with a keeper, and took and went, as Jesse had commanded him.

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:53.299
And he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:54.299
the battle.

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:58.339
It's interesting that right away in verse number 20, as David is fulfilling the responsibilities

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.899
that have been given to him from his father, of course, we jumped in kind of midway into

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:04.019
the passage.

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:08.779
The children of Israel are at battle against the Philistines, Jesse says, David, take these

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.140
things and go see how your brethren fare, so on and so forth.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.579
And just in verse number 20, we find that the Bible reveals to us that David is punctual.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:22.899
He rose up early in the morning, we see that he's responsible, that he left the sheep with

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.420
a keeper, and we see that he was obedient.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.420
And what a blessing to see the character of David being revealed to us immediately as

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.179
he would rise up to go and fulfill the responsibility that was given to him from his father.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:40.339
We find that, skip down if you will, and we're going to come back and catch all these verses,

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:43.260
but skip down to verse 45, I'll give you the title.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.779
Notice this, this is one of the statements that we're going to look into and dig into

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:47.859
this morning.

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:53.660
Verse 45, Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.700
spear, and with a shield.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.540
But I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.820
whom thou hast defied.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.700
I've taken the title from verse number 45 this morning, and I've simply used part of

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.540
the phrase, I come in the name of the Lord.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.179
You think about the New Testament principle in Ephesians chapter number six, be strong

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:23.200
in the Lord and the power of his might.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.320
We understand that Paul says very plainly as he's speaking to the believers in Corinth

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.679
that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, right, they're spiritual.

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:38.040
And we understand that here as David would make one of these declarations, he says, I

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.320
come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.820
As we look at the passage of scripture, first notice with me the problem they faced.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.760
Notice first of all the problem they faced.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.160
We're familiar with the passage again, and we understand that they were facing a great

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160
difficulty.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.160
In verse number 21, to pick back up where we are, the Bible says, for Israel and the

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.679
Philistines had put the battle at Array, army against army.

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:07.559
David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:09.720
and came and saluted his brethren.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.480
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.160
Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.519
words, and notice this phrase, and David heard them.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.959
And David heard them.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:31.160
It's interesting to me that as David fulfills the responsibility that had been given to

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.119
him from his father, he comes and he arrives and there's greetings that are exchanged according

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:42.679
to what we find in verse 22 and 23, and as they're speaking, as he talked with them,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:50.559
the Bible tells us that Goliath comes out, he appears, and he defies the armies of God.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:55.039
Notice with me, if you go back in our text of Scripture to verse number 9, the Bible

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:59.719
says, actually go back to verse number 8, it says, and he stood and cried, this is Goliath,

00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:04.000
he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them, why are ye come out to

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.799
set your battle in Array?

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:09.119
Am not I a Philistine, and ye servants of Saul?

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:14.679
Notice what he says, choose you a man for you and let him come down to me.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:19.440
If he be able to fight with me and to kill me, then will we be your servants.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.599
But if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall ye be our servants and serve us.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:32.799
The Bible tells us in verse number 10, the Philistines said, I defy the armies of Israel

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:37.119
this day, give me a man that we may fight together.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:42.919
It's interesting, as the Bible gives us the challenge as it's given to us here in these

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:49.520
verses, we understand that Goliath was a stature, the stature of this man was huge, he was about

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.520
9 feet 9 inches tall, he was a very large man, a very successful warrior, in fact, later

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.080
in our passage, we understand that Saul says, hey David, I understand you're

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.120
and you're volunteering, but you're not able.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.720
This man, he's been a man of war since his youth,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.640
and we understand the testimony, if you will,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.820
if we use that word of Goliath

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.000
and we think about the way in which

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.440
this man is now defying.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.200
And he says very simply,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.540
I defy the armies of Israel this day.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.600
Now this is what David heard.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.780
Because it tells us in verse number 23

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.400
that he spake according to the same words,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.920
and David heard them.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.520
And David heard them.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.640
I wonder, as we look at the passage

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.800
and we begin to dig in,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.240
we understand how David responds,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.520
but I want you to be mindful of the response

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.080
of the people outside of David.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.040
See, this was a serious problem

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.220
that they were facing.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.760
The Bible says in verse number 11,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.680
when Saul and all Israel

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.480
heard those words of the Philistine,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.640
what did they do?

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.560
They were dismayed and greatly afraid.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.340
Saul, he stood head and shoulders

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.500
above all the others.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.100
Is that not right?

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.940
That's one of the reasons

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.780
from the human perspective of the nation of Israel

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.960
that Saul was selected to be the king.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.660
And we understand that as we look

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.340
at the passage of Scripture,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.580
that the Bible says that they were dismayed

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.740
and greatly afraid.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.800
David hears these words in verse number 23,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.960
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.120
that as David is standing there and hearing them,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.760
that the other men of Israel hear,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.200
and notice what it says,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.560
and what's the next word in verse number 24?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.680
And all the men of Israel,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.800
when they saw the man,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.260
who's the man?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.280
Goliath.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.600
They fled from him and were sore afraid.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.920
They fled from him.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.420
They were sore afraid.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.980
It's interesting as we think about

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.140
the response of the nation of Israel

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.840
and we think about these individuals.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.040
Listen, these were men that had been

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.640
experienced in fighting.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.680
These were the armies of Israel.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.760
These were men that had experienced victory

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.180
even in their own lives

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.380
as they had battled in the past.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.600
And we find that for the nation of Israel,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.940
they're now in this place

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.060
where they hear Goliath

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.340
and they hear these words

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.480
and they're fearful.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.380
The Bible tells us that they fled.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.500
They were sore afraid.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.840
It told us in verse number 11

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.660
that they were greatly afraid.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.880
Remember, God said this

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.340
as Paul was speaking to Timothy,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.500
for God hath not given us the spirit of fear,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.940
but of power and of love

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.900
and of a sound mind.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.020
See, the reality is that all of the army,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.520
all of the men of Israel,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.120
they all were fearful

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.740
because there was something missing

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.960
in the lives of those individuals

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.540
that was present in the life of David.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.580
See, there was something distinctly different

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.240
about David than all of these other men

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.300
that were there.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.260
Oh, was it that he was a greater warrior?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.240
Oh, was it that he was more experienced?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.600
No. He's probably younger than most of them.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.760
We know that he's speaking to his brothers

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.520
and we know that all of his brothers

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.060
are older than him.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.180
Amen?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.960
And you have the youngest one now coming.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.060
David, he's fulfilling the responsibility.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.760
We could ask ourselves this morning,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.680
why was David in that place?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.600
Because his dad told him to go.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.520
He was obedient.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.280
See, when we're where God leads us,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760
we find that God will use us.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.520
Oh, we may face some oppositions.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.960
We may face some challenges.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.080
We may face some difficulties.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.000
We find that as soon as David gets there,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.700
they're really sharing pleasantries.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.280
I mean, greeting one another.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280
And as they're greeting one another,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.960
he hears Goliath come out

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.740
and make these statements.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.960
And we notice the problem they face.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.580
This is a serious problem.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.860
This problem wasn't going away any time soon.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.540
We understand that throughout much of the history,

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.160
especially of David, Saul,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.220
as that period of history for the nation of Israel,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.640
the Philistines were their consistent foe.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.600
I mean, they consistently were in battle

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.360
one with the other, one with the other.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.300
And you see that we find that this problem

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.360
was not going to go.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.560
Goliath had defied the armies of Israel.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.180
Goliath had come and he had given the challenge

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.160
and we find the problem was serious.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.680
Listen, the reality this morning

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.520
is that we don't seek to pretend

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.560
that the problem doesn't exist.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.240
There are problems that we face.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.400
There are challenges and obstacles.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.200
We studied in the book of Joshua,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.020
as you deal with the inheritance

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.080
and all that was going on

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.600
and as they were dividing the land.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.720
And one of the lessons that we had recently,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.200
we dealt with the latter part of chapter number 17

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.320
with the sons of Joseph,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.060
when they said, this land isn't enough for us.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.180
We're a great people.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.280
We need more.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.760
And Joshua gives them good counsel.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.700
Joshua provides them with direction,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.780
but they say, oh, well,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.800
you understand that the Anakims are there.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.920
I mean, there's great people there.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.900
The Canaanites are there and these, excuse me,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.600
I said Anakims, I meant Canaanites.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.760
The Canaanites are there.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.640
They're great people.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.320
They have chariots of iron.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.040
Joshua didn't deny any of that.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.340
Joshua just let them know that God was greater.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.160
See, we don't deny that the opposition is there.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.560
On Wednesday evening,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.320
we dealt with the passage of Scripture there

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.520
in the book of Nehemiah.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.240
And as we dealt with the book of Nehemiah

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.200
and we dealt with the fact that there are many adversaries,

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.840
the reality is that you never see Nehemiah

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.560
going to the people and saying,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.720
oh, they're not really against us.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.280
No, no, the problem was serious, right?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.420
We face problems in our lives.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.860
We face problems as a society, as a nation.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.900
We face problems.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.600
And we see that the nation of Israel

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.060
at this particular time, they had a serious problem.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.940
We wanna focus this morning on the remainder of our time

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.320
on this thought, number two, if you're taking notes.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.820
We notice the problem they face,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.220
but now consider the perspective of David.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.340
I'm gonna walk through the passage of Scripture

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.260
and I'm gonna highlight the statements

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.900
that David makes as we go through the passage.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.260
And we'll find beginning in verse number 26.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.860
It's the first statement that we see.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.860
Remember, in verse number 24,

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.620
the Bible told us that the men of Israel,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.500
all the men of Israel, when they saw the man,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.100
when they saw Goliath, they fled from him,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.180
they were sore afraid.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.580
The men of Israel said, notice in verse 25,

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.660
have you seen this man that has come up?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.020
Surely to defy Israel has he come up,

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.860
and it shall be that the man who killeth him,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.940
the king shall enrich or will enrich him with great riches

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.180
and will give him his daughter

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.080
and make his father's house free in Israel.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.320
I want you to consider,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.760
even as we begin looking at the perspective of David,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.600
it's important for us to consider the perspective

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.640
of the people in verse number 25.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.200
What is their perspective?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.120
Notice what they say.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.640
Have you seen this man that has come up?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.640
What are they focused on?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.720
The problem.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.400
They're focused on Goliath, right?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.960
They're focused on, have you seen him?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.680
I mean, look at how big he is.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.360
Look at how powerful he is.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.880
What's their focus?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.080
Their focus is their problem.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.880
The focus is their problem.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.760
If we're not careful, we focus on the problem.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.000
You remember the passage of Scripture

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.480
in the book of Exodus when they're leaving Egypt.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.400
Exodus chapter number 14 gives us the record

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.960
of the crossing of the Red Sea.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.520
The Red Sea is before them.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.080
The Egyptians are behind them.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.240
If you look at the passage of Scripture,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.360
the Bible tells us that the people said.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.320
What did the people say?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.400
Would you bring us here to die?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.680
We're gonna die.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680
There's no way out.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.440
Moses said, because God said,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.080
stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.400
See, it's a matter of perspective.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.120
And we find that in this passage of Scripture,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.720
the men, all of these soldiers, the army of Israel,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.560
their perspective is on their problem.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.560
Can I tell you that when we focus on the problem

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.160
long enough, it gets bigger, right?

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.880
I mean, we just keep focusing on it

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.440
and it just keeps, it just got our attention.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.680
But look at David, verse 26,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.720
the first statement that he makes.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.320
And David spake to the men that stood by him.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920
Now, can you imagine this?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.200
I mean, maybe we could do some role play this morning

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.840
figuratively, because we can't move around

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840
and all that sort of thing.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.360
But let's just say that this morning,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360
I'm standing over here.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.480
I got Armando and Mark and I got Rick and I got Michael

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.200
and I got these guys over here and we're standing here

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.080
and we're talking about something that has to happen

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.799
and we're like, man, I just have no idea

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.920
how we're gonna do this.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.880
And it's just, it's not gonna be possible

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.200
and we're just looking at the problem.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.320
And then Joseph comes over and says,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.280
hey, guys, did you consider?

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.119
And we're like, who is this?

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:58.040
What is, this is a men's conversation, right?

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.480
I mean, David's the youngest.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.160
David's probably, like I said, an older teenager

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.720
at this particular time in his life, as best we can tell.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.239
And we find that he comes and he spake to the men.

00:19:10.239 --> 00:19:13.840
I'm thankful that David had some courage.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.440
I'm thankful that David was willing to go

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.440
and speak to these men and give them a perspective of faith.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.320
Notice it says, what shall be done to the man

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.559
that killeth the Philistine

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.239
and taketh away the reproach of Israel?

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:28.080
They had mentioned that in verse 25,

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:30.559
but notice at the end of verse number 26,

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.559
for who is this uncircumcised Philistine

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:38.720
that he should defy the armies of the living God?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.280
Y'all are focused on this guy and saying,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.520
have you seen him?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.400
But I wanna ask you a question.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.920
Who is he that he should defy the armies of the living God?

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.440
We begin to see immediately in verse number 26,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.840
the perspective of David is quite different

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.600
than the perspective of the army.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.440
As we continue through the.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.760
passage, we find in verse 27 that the people answered him after this manner

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.800
saying, so shall it be done to the man that killeth him. Is it not interesting

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.600
that as they respond to David, they only answer the first question and not the

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.200
second question? The first question was, what shall be done to the man that

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.480
killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel? The second

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.600
question is, who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.760
armies of the Living God? And the people answered him after this manner saying, so

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.040
shall it be done to the man that killeth him. And Eliab, his eldest brother, now if

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.440
you got some siblings, see we got the Trejos over here, they got all kinds of

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.520
siblings, amen? Perfect. Sam, you're the oldest one that's here this morning, all

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.760
right? But David's the oldest. But notice Eliab is gonna say something to his

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.000
little brother, so we could do some role play again, right? And you see one of the

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.800
younger brothers saying, come on, we can do this, and Sam's like, shut up, boy.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.360
Like, what are you doing? Right? And we see it, right? With sibling rivalry, right? I

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.600
only had one brother, I'm the oldest. I could smack him around a little bit when

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.959
we're younger, now he's bigger and stronger than I am, and so I talk nice to

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:16.959
him, amen? But the reality is that in verse 28 it says that his oldest brother

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:22.440
says this, he said, in Eliab, verse 28, his eldest brother heard when he's speaking

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.000
to the men, and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, why

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.360
camest thou down hither? And with whom hast thou let those few sheep in the

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.639
wilderness? Well, David was responsible, we already mentioned that. He left him

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:41.279
with a keeper. The reason that he was there is because his dad sent him. But

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:50.480
notice what Eliab says, I know thy pride. Really? Really? And the naughtiness of

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:57.200
thine heart, for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. We see

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.639
David speaking again in verse 29. It's probably one of the most famous

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:08.760
references of David's words from this passage of Scripture. He says, what have

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:16.199
I now done? Is there not a cause? Is there not a cause? We've mentioned that

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:21.279
phraseology in many various settings over the past, and you find, again, that's

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:26.520
a very familiar reference to this passage. We find it in verse number 30

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.800
that he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner. The

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.559
people answered him again after the former manner. And when the words were

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:38.080
heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul, and he sent for him. And

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.600
David said to Saul, notice again the statements of David here in verse

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.199
number 32, David said to Saul, notice what he says, let no man's heart fail

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:51.680
because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. Isn't that

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:59.000
awesome? I mean, David, he heard what Goliath said. David saw how the army

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.720
responded. He saw how they were greatly afraid. They were sore afraid. And the

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.000
Bible tells us that when David is in the presence of Saul, he says, Saul, let no

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:13.000
man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.119
Philistine. He just volunteered. I love it. The courage. See, we're beginning to see

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:24.680
the perspective of David through these statements, and it's gonna lead up, all of

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.119
these statements culminate to the latter statements that we read right before the

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:33.680
battle between David and Goliath. It's a very quick battle, obviously, but

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.600
right before it, really, they engage one with another, and we see how all of these

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.240
statements are leading up to that perspective that is a Godward

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.559
perspective. Notice that David volunteers, and Saul then responds to David in

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:54.880
verse 33, thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.000
Thou art not able. I just, for a moment of time, I want to think about Saul for just

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.600
a moment. He's the king, right? He's the king of Israel. How many other volunteers

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:14.279
did he have? Nobody. So now you finally get a volunteer, and you say, yeah, thanks

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:20.519
for the offer, but no, you're not able. I mean, think about that. Saul has no other

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:26.760
options. He's got no options here. David is coming, and we see his perspective.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.839
He's saying, let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:34.640
fight with this Philistine, and Saul says, nope, you're not able. Here's why you're

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:41.679
not able. For thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. Saul

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:46.640
objected to the volunteer of David. Saul said, it's just not going to work. I mean,

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:53.679
Saul could see the end, and in his mind, it was not a good situation. In his mind,

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:57.880
it was certain that if David were the one to go and battle against Goliath,

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:03.600
that it would mean bad things for the nation. He was looking again. What's his

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:10.720
perspective? It's a horizontal plane perspective, right? It's a looking at

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.959
somebody and what you think their capabilities are versus looking at the

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:22.519
opposition and what their capabilities are without any acknowledge of what God

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:32.239
is able to do, right? Here, the conversation continues. In verses 34 down through

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:36.160
verse number 37, David begins to rehearse some things to Saul. As he

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:42.239
rehearses these things to Saul, we find that he is remembering what God has done,

00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:48.399
which gives him faith for what God will do. Notice in verse 34, and David said

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:54.160
unto Saul, thy servant kept his father's sheep. And there came a lion and a bear

00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.000
and took a lamb out of the flock. And then it says this in verse 35, and I went

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.200
out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth. Now, can

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:18.119
you imagine Saul hearing this? I look at David saying this and I think about

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:21.760
David. He's not being prideful in saying this. He's simply rehearsing what has

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.679
happened in his life. He's rehearsing what God had done, which gave him faith

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.000
for what God will do. And he says there's a lion. Now, I've seen lions from a

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.239
distance. They're powerful. I have no desire to jump into a lion cage. You know,

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:39.360
these people, they get real close and I want to jump in and all this stuff. I have

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.519
no interest, no desire whatsoever to do that. I'm not really interested in going

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:46.839
on a safari and seeing all these lions climb up all over the vehicle. Then I'm

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:52.360
just not interested. And we find that David notices the immediate response

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:57.720
that he says that when that that lion came and took a lamb out of the flock

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:04.920
that he went out after him. He went after him. You say, well, what would you do? I'd

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.000
probably count it a loss. I mean, well, you probably would too. Let's be honest.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.720
Amen? You're like, man, that's a shame. He's gonna have a good meal. I mean,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:28.720
seriously. Not David. He rose up, went after him. Notice what it says. When he

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:41.440
arose against me, I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him. Wow.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:52.959
Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear. Notice what he says. Verse 36. And

00:27:52.959 --> 00:28:03.679
this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the

00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:10.920
armies of the living God. The perspective is Godward. Notice verse 37. David said,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:17.160
moreover, he's not done yet. He shared what God has done, which gives him faith

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.279
and courage for what God will do. And notice how plainly he puts it in verse

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:26.959
37. The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the

00:28:26.959 --> 00:28:34.000
bear. Notice this phrase. He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.280
Saul said unto David, go and the Lord be with thee. Again, we see the courage and

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.159
perspective of David through these statements that he makes. He says, Saul,

00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:54.359
let me just give you a little bit of my history. Let me inform you of what

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:59.919
happened when I was taking care of some of the flock. And he says, moreover, I want

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:05.520
you to understand that the Lord that delivered, right? He doesn't take the

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.440
the recognition for himself. He doesn't say because of my... No, he says the Lord

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.239
that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, out of the paw of the bear. He will

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:23.640
deliver me. It's interesting what Saul says. He went from thou art not able to

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.320
go and the Lord be with thee. It's interesting as to why Saul might respond

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.679
the way that he did. I think that Saul understood the genuineness of David. I

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:41.840
think that he saw the heart of David. That David believed with certainty that

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.760
God was able and what God was going to do. See, I don't see David as being a

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.239
double-minded man. I don't see David as being wavering in his faith. I don't see

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:56.679
David sitting up there all timid and saying, well, I think maybe if we could

00:29:56.679 --> 00:30:02.359
maybe... No, no. David's like just, here's my God.

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:03.739
God.

00:30:03.739 --> 00:30:05.859
Here's what my God is able to do.

00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:09.199
Here's what my God has done in my life.

00:30:09.199 --> 00:30:14.139
And you think that I'm scared of this Goliath because he's nine feet, nine inches tall,

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:17.219
because he has all of the armor that he has?

00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:20.939
That's nothing compared to my God.

00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:22.779
Because my God is able.

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:25.059
Because I've seen my God work.

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:30.259
I mean, look at the statements of David.

00:30:30.259 --> 00:30:32.679
And look at his perspective.

00:30:32.679 --> 00:30:39.059
And we find that now in verse number 38, that Saul then arms David with his armor, put a

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:41.339
helmet of brass upon his head.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:44.999
Also he armed him with a coat of mail, and David girded a sword upon his armor.

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:49.939
In verse 39, in a sade to go, it says this, for he had not proved it.

00:30:49.939 --> 00:30:53.899
David, again, we see a statement here at the end of verse number 39, and David said unto

00:30:53.899 --> 00:31:01.219
Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved them, and David put them off him.

00:31:01.219 --> 00:31:06.419
The Bible doesn't tell us necessarily what the response of the people that observed this.

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:09.859
But I just wonder if there's somebody saying, that guy's crazy.

00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:13.859
I mean, he's not even taking armor with him.

00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:14.859
He wasn't crazy.

00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:21.219
He had his eyes on God.

00:31:21.219 --> 00:31:25.339
He understood that God said, let there be light.

00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:27.399
And there was light.

00:31:27.399 --> 00:31:32.979
He understood that God spoke everything into existence.

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:37.579
And no doubt in my mind, David had heard about the Red Sea.

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:40.499
No doubt in my mind that David had heard about the Jordan River.

00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:45.519
No doubt in my mind that David had heard about what happened at Jericho and Ai, and you fill

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:48.199
in the blank of all of the conquering of the land.

00:31:48.199 --> 00:31:50.059
David had heard those things.

00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:52.659
David understood what God was able to do.

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:56.059
And David was looking at God.

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:59.859
We find in verse number 40, it says, he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:03.299
stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag, which he had evened in his

00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:04.299
script.

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:06.819
And a sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.

00:32:06.819 --> 00:32:09.879
The Philistine came on and drew near unto David, and in verse number 41, the man that

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:11.179
bare the shield went before him.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:16.419
I've never understood why someone had to go before Goliath if he was so great.

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:17.419
Honestly.

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:23.299
It says in verse 42, and when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him,

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:27.059
for he was but a youth and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:33.979
Notice, the Philistine says, am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?

00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:37.019
The Philistine cursed David by his gods.

00:32:37.019 --> 00:32:42.099
Verse 44, the Philistine said to David, come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the

00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:45.499
fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:53.619
Pride, arrogance, but can I tell you from a human perspective, what Goliath was saying

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:54.619
was true.

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:58.539
Goliath was a man of war from his youth.

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:01.939
Goliath, no doubt in my mind, had killed many people.

00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:02.939
Right?

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:04.779
He'd been the victor.

00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:08.539
He's called the champion of the Philistines.

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:12.259
You don't get that title because you've been sitting on the couch.

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:14.499
Amen?

00:33:14.499 --> 00:33:16.059
He's been in some battles.

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:21.379
He's gone through some things, and he looks, remember, he gave the challenge in the beginning

00:33:21.379 --> 00:33:24.619
of the passage, choose you a man for him and let him come down to me.

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:28.419
I almost see Goliath saying, that's the best you've got?

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.139
Like seriously?

00:33:30.139 --> 00:33:33.839
We've been dealing with this and I've been defying you and that's the best you can come

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.379
up with?

00:33:35.379 --> 00:33:36.379
This is the mind of Goliath.

00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:41.859
Goliath says, here's what I'm going to do, come on, I'm going to tear you up and I'm

00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:43.379
going to feed your flesh to the fowls.

00:33:44.379 --> 00:33:49.979
So he says, another statement of David in verse number 45.

00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:53.419
Another statement that reveals to us the perspective.

00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:59.939
David said to the Philistine, thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear, with

00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:07.819
a shield, but I, I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies

00:34:07.819 --> 00:34:11.219
of Israel whom thou hast defied.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.699
He makes it known, plain and clear.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:19.339
Here's how you're coming, but here's how I'm coming.

00:34:19.339 --> 00:34:26.419
Verse 46, this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand.

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:28.939
He'd already said that to Saul, had he not?

00:34:28.939 --> 00:34:32.859
He said to Saul, verse number 37, the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion,

00:34:32.859 --> 00:34:36.779
out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine.

00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:43.539
And so David is now, they're facing one another, there's some distance between them, we understand

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:46.339
because of what's going to happen in just a few verses.

00:34:46.339 --> 00:34:50.899
And Goliath has said some things to David and David said, listen, I want you to understand

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:54.859
that you're coming to me with this sword and this spear and this shield, but I'm coming

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.979
to you in the name of the Lord of hosts.

00:34:56.979 --> 00:35:04.659
And I want you to understand that this day will the Lord deliver thine hand, thee into

00:35:04.659 --> 00:35:06.599
mine hand.

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:08.159
He doesn't stop there.

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:16.799
He says, I will smite thee and I will take thine head from thee and I will give the carcasses

00:35:16.799 --> 00:35:21.759
of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beast

00:35:21.759 --> 00:35:23.399
of the earth.

00:35:23.399 --> 00:35:33.719
Notice what he says, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:39.399
David wasn't interested in being known as the champion of the Israelites.

00:35:39.399 --> 00:35:42.599
Goliath was known as the champion of the Philistines.

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:48.399
David didn't ask for the women in chapter number 18 that sang his praise that Saul had

00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:51.959
slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.

00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:53.439
David wasn't seeking for that.

00:35:53.439 --> 00:35:54.919
That's not what David wanted.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:59.439
We understand that Saul, that really messed Saul up.

00:35:59.439 --> 00:36:07.459
Another message entirely, but we understand that David, his perspective, the whole motive

00:36:07.459 --> 00:36:14.239
was that all the earth may know that there's a God in Israel.

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:18.279
That all the earth may know there's a God in Israel.

00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:25.879
David says, you know what, when you look at it on paper, you should win.

00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:29.199
But you forgot to understand what God is able to do.

00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:31.119
You forgot to understand what God is able to do.

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:39.039
I read verse number 46 in our Bibles and I read that verse and I just say, what faith,

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:41.039
what courage.

00:36:41.039 --> 00:36:44.439
Here's what God's going to do, 100%.

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:48.239
I mean, he's just absolutely 100% convinced this is what God's going to do.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.239
Why?

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.239
Because he knew who God was.

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:55.479
See, he said, I will declare thy greatness in Psalm 145.

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:58.479
In Psalm 135, I know that the Lord is great.

00:36:58.479 --> 00:37:03.439
If you know that God is great, it's going to lead to you declaring his greatness.

00:37:03.439 --> 00:37:07.979
You're going to begin to operate, live your life with the understanding that you serve

00:37:07.979 --> 00:37:11.000
a great God.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.359
Verse 47, and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear,

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:25.959
for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands.

00:37:25.959 --> 00:37:31.199
It came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David.

00:37:31.199 --> 00:37:32.719
I love verse number 48.

00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:37.619
It says that David hasted and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:39.319
There was no back and down.

00:37:39.319 --> 00:37:45.000
This wasn't David trying to just talk some kind of a talk and come to a place where maybe

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.919
I will intimidate this giant, this Philistine, to not want to have battle because I'm going

00:37:50.919 --> 00:37:54.159
to just talk a talk and I'm going to scare him and he's going to leave.

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:55.159
No, no.

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:58.759
David runs right after him.

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:01.719
This is, we're going to see what God's going to do.

00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:04.839
The Bible continues, again, familiar passage of Scripture.

00:38:04.839 --> 00:38:08.679
Notice verse 49, David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and swang it and

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:12.319
smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell

00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:14.799
upon his face to the earth.

00:38:14.799 --> 00:38:19.359
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.799
and slew him.

00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:22.319
There was no sword in the hand of David.

00:38:22.319 --> 00:38:23.319
Why?

00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:24.319
Because he said, I have not proved them.

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:25.679
He didn't take it.

00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:28.679
So what do you do?

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:32.959
Verse 51, therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew

00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:37.159
it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:41.719
And when the Philistine saw their champion was dead, they fled.

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:46.159
Yeah, I guess so.

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:48.919
We see the perspective of David.

00:38:48.919 --> 00:38:50.679
We consider the perspective of David.

00:38:50.679 --> 00:38:54.159
We've read the statements of what David says.

00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:58.359
And we've understood some things about the heart of David.

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:01.359
See, all of the army was fearful.

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.799
They were so afraid.

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:07.919
They heard the words and they went and they retreated.

00:39:07.919 --> 00:39:08.919
They were hiding.

00:39:08.919 --> 00:39:10.159
They were fearful.

00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:14.559
But David heard the words and says, hold on guys, who is this uncircumcised Philistine

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:17.119
that he should defy the armies of the living God?

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:19.479
Hold on guys, is there not a cause?

00:39:19.479 --> 00:39:20.479
Hold on.

00:39:20.479 --> 00:39:21.479
I want you to understand, Saul.

00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:22.479
Here's what God did.

00:39:22.479 --> 00:39:25.519
There was a lion, there was a bear and God delivered him out of my hand.

00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:28.399
And so will he deliver this Philistine into my hand.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:32.519
I want you to understand, Goliath, I've heard what you've said, but I want you to understand

00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:37.760
that you're coming with sword and shield and spear, but I'm coming in the name of the Lord

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
of hosts.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.799
I want you to understand that I'm going to, the Lord's going to deliver you into my hand

00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:43.799
today.

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:47.760
Do you think that you're going to kill me and feed my carcass to the fowls of the air?

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.039
I want you to understand there, Goliath, that God's going to deliver you into my hand

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:57.200
and it's your carcass that's going to be eaten by these fowls.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.959
Man, what a perspective.

00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:02.359
It's a God-ward perspective.

00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:09.719
perspective. Remember, all the army, when they heard, what did they say? Have you seen

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:16.019
this Philistine? Right? What are they looking at? The problem. Looking at the problem. They

00:40:16.019 --> 00:40:21.379
have no solution for the problem, by the way, because they know that in and of themselves,

00:40:21.379 --> 00:40:27.099
and that's all they had, they weren't having that Godward perspective, they had no opportunity,

00:40:27.099 --> 00:40:35.399
no chance. I mean, it was, they were afraid. But those same men, the same army, because

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:44.939
David had a perspective that was Godward, because David had courage and faith, he influenced

00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:51.259
the army. In verse number 52 of our text, the Bible says, and the men of Israel and

00:40:51.259 --> 00:40:58.859
of Judah arose. They were fearful. Remember, they were hiding. They heard the words of

00:40:58.859 --> 00:41:04.939
Goliath and they were so afraid. But now that Goliath was dead, now because they saw the

00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:11.939
courage and the faith and they saw God's hand at work, now they arise. And the Bible says

00:41:11.939 --> 00:41:16.939
that they shouted. They pursued the Philistines until they come to the valley and to the gates

00:41:16.939 --> 00:41:21.659
of Ekron. And the wound of the Philistines fell down by the way of Sherem, even unto

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:25.619
Gath and unto Ekron. The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:31.179
and they spoiled their tents. Now, all of a sudden, they want to get involved in what's

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:38.419
going on. But I want you to think about the situation here. Again, it's a familiar passage

00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:44.859
of Scripture. They faced a problem. There was a problem they had. And it was a real

00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:52.099
problem. It wasn't going away anytime soon. And by the way, could God have dealt with

00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:57.379
the Philistines some other way? Sure, he could have. We read throughout the Scriptures there

00:41:57.379 --> 00:42:02.579
are plenty of other ways that God dealt with the enemy. There are times in which God dealt

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:06.939
with the enemy, such as what happened during the time of the Assyrians when they came against

00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:12.159
Hezekiah. Of course, the nation of Israel had been taken captive by the Assyrians. Now

00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:17.719
they're going to come to Judah. Hezekiah is the king. And we understand that Rabshakeh,

00:42:17.719 --> 00:42:22.359
he's a bad guy. We understand all that's taking place, all of the threats that come. Sennacherib

00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:27.839
is the king. And all that's going on. And what does Hezekiah do? Man, he lays that stuff

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:32.439
out before the Lord and he prays and he seeks the face of God. He says, God, I know that

00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:36.959
you're the creator. I know that you're able. You're the living God. You're holy. I mean,

00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:41.799
you read the prayer of Hezekiah. It is a powerful prayer. And you find that Isaiah,

00:42:41.799 --> 00:42:45.759
the prophet, he comes and he says, hey, listen, God's going to take care of them. What'd he

00:42:45.759 --> 00:42:51.919
do? He sent an angel, took care of them. They didn't have to do a thing. But in 1 Samuel

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:58.919
17, God used a man. God used a man. That man was David. We could look at a whole host of

00:42:59.879 --> 00:43:05.279
other examples this morning. We don't have time. But what I want to say is that there

00:43:05.279 --> 00:43:10.679
was a problem. And I'm thankful that there was a man that had a proper perspective. A

00:43:10.679 --> 00:43:16.119
perspective that was Godward. A perspective that understood that my God is bigger. My

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:21.199
God is greater. There was an understanding of the greatness of God and what He is able

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:27.159
to do. And instead of just sitting around and joining the round table discussion with

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:31.199
Saul and the other generals as to what are we going to do with this Philistine, David

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:38.319
just said, I'll go. Don't worry. God's going to deliver him into my hand. This morning,

00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:50.879
we face problems. Globally, nationally, locally, we face problems. We face problems in our

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:58.879
homes. We have personal problems. I mean, it goes from 7.5 billion people, global problems

00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:08.759
that we have, all the way down to individual problems that we have. Amen? But can I tell

00:44:08.759 --> 00:44:14.239
you that God's greater than any of them. And what happens far too often is we focus upon

00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:19.479
the problem and our perspective is horizontal. We're on that horizontal plane and we're looking

00:44:19.519 --> 00:44:23.039
at the problem and it's growing and it's growing and it's growing and it's a bigger problem,

00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:30.039
bigger problem. There's no way. There's nothing that can happen. There's no solution to this.

00:44:30.039 --> 00:44:37.039
God. God. And here comes David. I'm thankful that Jesse gave him some orders. I'm coming

00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:46.239
down. I haven't come down off this platform in four months. Amen? Listen. Jesse followed

00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:54.239
the Lord and told David to go. David goes and he arrives and it's like, what is going

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:05.359
on here? All the discussion I'm hearing is about the problem. Everyone's talking about,

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:12.359
have you seen this giant? I heard what he said. Y'all are afraid. And David just says,

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:18.879
what about God? Who is this uncircumcised villain seeing that he should defy the armies

00:45:18.879 --> 00:45:24.119
of the living God? Psalm 121, I will lift up my eyes into the hills from whence cometh

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:30.359
my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Listen, what happens

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:34.759
so often in our lives. And if we're not careful, I will be honest and transparent with you

00:45:34.759 --> 00:45:38.479
this morning. There are times that I've been guilty of this very thing over the last four

00:45:38.479 --> 00:45:43.759
months. We sit around and we talk about all the problems. And we forget to understand

00:45:43.759 --> 00:45:49.799
that we have a God that is greater. We have a God who is able to do, listen, I believe

00:45:49.799 --> 00:45:56.799
Ephesians 3.20. He is able to do exceeding abundantly above. What's the Bible say about

00:45:58.439 --> 00:46:03.559
every word of God is pure. No one gave God a certain number of words he had to use in

00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:10.519
the Bible. And God wanted us to understand, is it redundant? Yes, for our good. He's able

00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:14.719
to do exceeding abundantly above. Couldn't he just say he's able to do? Yeah, he could

00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:20.039
have. But doesn't it help you when you know that he says he's able to do exceedingly,

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:27.039
exceeding abundantly above all that you ask or think. Now let me ask you something. Can

00:46:28.039 --> 00:46:35.039
you think of some great things? We can think of some great things. God's able to do greater.

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:40.719
Sometimes our prayer, we think it's a prayer of faith, but really it's not really proving

00:46:40.719 --> 00:46:47.719
God. In Malachi, God says prove me. Prove me! Because God is able. God is able. And

00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:55.719
when we look at the perspective of David in 1 Samuel 17, and we think about all the context

00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:02.879
of what's happening, we find something very interesting. David's not talking about the

00:47:02.879 --> 00:47:09.879
enemy. He's talking about his God. He only references the enemy as it has to deal in

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:17.119
relation to what his God is going to do to the enemy. I like that. I like that. I like

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:23.079
that. It helps me. I hope it helps you. See, I have a question. I've asked myself this

00:47:23.079 --> 00:47:27.319
week a number of times, and really I was going to preach this message last Sunday, but it

00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:31.519
was Father's Day and the Lord just didn't give me liberty. And I preached another message

00:47:31.519 --> 00:47:36.599
and of course I praise the Lord for that passage in Proverbs 4. I hope it was a blessing to

00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:41.079
you. But we look at this and I've really been kind of just musing on this passage of Scripture

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:46.279
over the last couple of weeks. The Lord gave it to me and really just revealed some things

00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:52.719
to me. Yes, I know the passage, but helping me to understand a little bit about the perspective

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:57.599
and be reminded of what's happening. And I came to this conclusion, a question really

00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:04.599
in my mind. Why is it that I want God to work? Do I want God to work in our midst so that

00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:11.599
I can have a level of comfort and return to some sense of normalcy? Or do I want God

00:48:19.039 --> 00:48:25.719
to work in our midst so that He alone would be exalted and glorified? Can I tell you there's

00:48:25.719 --> 00:48:30.000
a great difference? Sometimes we want God to work because I just want to go back to

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.679
normal. I just want to be comforted. I'm tired of the problems. I'm tired of the difficulties.

00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:43.279
I'm tired of the fill in the blank, right? And I just, God, I need you to work because

00:48:43.279 --> 00:48:50.279
I don't like this stuff. What's our real motive for wanting God to work? Is it because we

00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:59.599
want God to be exalted and glorified? If it is, it might mean that there's a Goliath that

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:06.599
we have to face. Amen? It may mean that there's a Goliath that we have to face and God will

00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:15.760
be exalted and glorified. Remember, what did David say? I want all the earth to know that

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:22.399
there's a God in Israel. How were they going to know? How was the host going to know? Because

00:49:22.399 --> 00:49:29.399
God was going to use this shepherd boy to kill this champion of the Philistines. And

00:49:30.399 --> 00:49:33.559
God was going to do it. And God was going to do it in such a way that he alone would

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:40.559
be glorified. Look at Psalm 115 and we'll close here. Psalm 115, look at this. Psalm

00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:48.479
115. The Bible says in verse number one, not unto us, O Lord, not unto us. Not unto us

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:02.320
but unto thy name give glory.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:11.280
for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake. See, I want God to be glorified. Sometimes,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.640
listen, we understand God's always able to work. I believe God's always at work.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.600
Sometimes He may not be working the way that you want Him to work or that I want Him to work,

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:30.160
but He's at work. God's working. And we look at the pastor and we say, listen, I want God to be

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.800
exalted and glorified. You know, there's a world that needs to know that we have a living God

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:44.880
that is able. But if we respond like the army of Israel and we have that fear,

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.840
sorely afraid, greatly afraid, and we have that horizontal, plain perspective,

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.520
do you know how bad, do you know how, and we just begin to talk about whether it's an individual

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:03.120
problem or a global problem? A whole lot of illustrations we could use of problems.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:11.120
No matter what the problem is, if that's our focus instead of our focus being on God. See,

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.920
David didn't deny that there was a problem. He just saw that God was greater. David didn't

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.880
deny that Goliath was there. He had to go fight Goliath. But he said, my God is greater.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:30.880
And this morning, I want that perspective. I hope that you want that perspective. Can I tell you

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.720
that we're only going to declare His greatness if we know that He's great? The only way you're

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.920
going to know He's great is if you get in this book, if you have experience in your life where

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:43.840
God has worked and God has answered prayer. See, God had worked in David's life. God had

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:51.920
shown and proven to David His power. David had great courage. These statements of David

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.280
encouraged me, and I hope that they encourage you this morning. See, I want to see God work,

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:05.120
but not just so that I can be comforted, not just so that I can have some level of normalcy.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.320
I want to see God work so that He would be exalted and glorified.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:16.080
And it may mean that we have to face a Goliath, but our God's greater. Amen? Do you believe this

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.920
morning that God's greater than any problem that you have? I don't want you to answer, but do you

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.400
acknowledge at times in your life that sometimes you live and I live like our problems are greater

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:33.120
than God? There are times when we do. We just get so wrapped up in whatever the problem is,

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.880
right? Where do we focus during the time of the storm? Master, carest thou not that we perish,

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.640
right? Isn't that not what the disciples said? Sometimes we feel like that, right?

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.480
Of course God cares, and all He had to do was say,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:53:00.240
Peace, be still. And all of their jaws were like, What manner of man is this? He's God.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.720
He's God, and He is able. Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for loving us.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.560
We thank you for the testimony of David. I thank you for the statements that we see

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.640
recorded here in 1 Samuel 17, how these statements reveal to us His perspective, His character.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:27.760
They reveal to us a genuine walk with You, Lord. We know that you'd already been anointed to be

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.680
the King, and you'd already said things to Samuel with regard to the character of the man that you

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.920
had chosen to be the King of Israel. We find that it's Stephen that, as he would preach right

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:45.360
before his death in Acts 7, that he speaks about David being a man after your own heart.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:55.760
God, we thank you for the testimony of David. Lord, I pray that as we look at this passage

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:01.040
of Scripture and think about the statements and what they reveal to us, God, you'd help each and

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:08.320
every one of us to have that upward expectation, that upward perspective, that we would

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.720
lift up our eyes into the hills from whence cometh our help, understanding that our help

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.160
cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. Help us, as we look at our theme for this year in

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.839
Hebrews 12, that we would look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, understanding

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:31.360
that you are the King of kings, Lord of lords, the great I Am, that you are the Lord God omnipotent,

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:37.760
that you reign, that there's nothing beyond your power. God, help us to understand this morning

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.480
that there's not one problem that we face, personally or globally, that's too big for you.

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:53.279
And God, I pray you'd help us to have a desire such as David's desire to see you work,

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.960
not so that anyone would say, oh, look at their faith or look at their courage, but that we

00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:05.360
would testify of the greatness of our God. They would know that there's a living God

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:13.760
that's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. God, help us to recognize

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.160
that if you're going to work in that fashion, there's some Goliaths that we have to face.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:30.640
Help us, Lord, to go not in the power of our own strength, but help us to go

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.679
to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might. Help us to go understanding

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:46.080
our spiritual armor in Ephesians 6. There in 1 Samuel 17, David said, I haven't proven them.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.600
God, thank you in the New Testament that you've given us what our spiritual armor is.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.320
I pray you'd help us to put on the whole armor of God, understand that we are engaged in this battle,

00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.960
that you're greater. No doubt this morning, our audience that's here locally, those that are

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:11.360
online, no doubt we have problems. And at times, we may be tempted to believe

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.640
that there's no solution to our problems.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:24.880
I kind of see Saul and the army of Israel in that situation prior to David's arrival.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:33.520
God, I'm so thankful that you are able. Would you work? Thank you for working in my heart.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.720
I pray that you'd work in each individual that's present today, Lord, those that are watching

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:52.160
online. Help us, Lord, to have a greater focus upon our God. In the days of difficulty and adversity,

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.360
would you help us to look to thee? Have your will and way, and we'll thank you for it. Would you

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.040
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano,

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.360
and as she does, the altar is open. You can pray in your seat. You can come to the altar if you'd

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:12.240
like. Pray at home, those watching live stream. The altar is open as Kimberly plays.
