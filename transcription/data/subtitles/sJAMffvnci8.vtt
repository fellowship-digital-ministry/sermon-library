00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.599
number six this evening. If you have your Bible with you, mark chapter number six. And specifically

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:12.319
this evening, we'll be looking at verses 45 down through verse number 52. And I trust it'll be an

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:18.159
encouragement to you this evening as we look at this portion of Scripture. And here in this section

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.639
of the book of Mark, we have the privilege of reading about a number of the miracles that the

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:28.319
Lord Jesus Christ performed. It's exciting to study through the Gospels and to see the life

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:34.479
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to study the miracles. And the text that's immediately

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.279
preceding that, which we'll be looking at this evening, is the text of Scripture that records

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:45.680
for us the feeding of the 5,000. And that's an exciting passage of Scripture, an exciting ministry,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.680
just a wonderful miracle that the Lord Jesus Christ performs. And of course, the disciples,

00:00:54.319 --> 00:01:00.080
they had the privilege of being personally involved in that particular miracle, where they were the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.199
ones that distributed all of the food. And they'd go back to Jesus, and Jesus kept multiplying it,

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.599
and they'd take it. And of course, the Bible tells us that they were all filled, and they took up

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.839
that which remained. And it's interesting, as we come to the text in which we're studying this

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:18.480
evening, we find that the Bible tells us that after they had gathered up those fragments,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.199
according to verse number 43, they took up 12 baskets full of the fragments of the fishes,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:29.279
and they that did eat of the loaves were about 5,000 men. And then we come in verse number 45,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.239
and as we get to verses 45 and 46, really, we note three specific things that take place.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:43.519
The Bible says, "...in straightway immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the ship

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:50.400
and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. And when he had

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.559
sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray." And so, as we look at verses 45 and 46 and

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.599
kind of get the backdrop, if you will, the setting for this particular text that we're going to study

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.319
this evening, we find that Jesus sends the disciples, he tells them to go get on the ship

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.800
and to go over to the other side, and then he sends all of those away that had experienced this

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.639
great miracle, that had been fed with these loaves and fishes, and we find that he sends them home.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:24.960
And then the Bible tells us that he himself, the Lord Jesus Christ, departed into a mountain

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.000
to pray. And as we look at the text of Scripture, we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 47,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.880
"...and when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land." And so we find,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.360
no doubt, that there was a level of obedience on the part of the disciples in verse number 45. He

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.600
tells them to go, and they did, and we find there's a part of obedience on the part of those

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.479
that had feasted on that miracle. They departed as well. And then the Bible says this in verse 48,

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:04.639
"...and he saw them toiling and rowing." I want to share a thought with you this evening. I've just

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:11.440
titled it here from verse number 48, "...he saw them, he saw them." And as we look at this passage

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.119
of Scripture, I want to really consider three truths that really just kind of pop out at me

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:22.800
this evening from this portion of Scripture. And obviously, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.000
demonstrates his power in this passage over nature, and what a wonderful truth to understand

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the way in which you study the miracles and the way in which the Lord Jesus Christ demonstrates

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.720
his power through his earthly ministry. But as we notice here what's going on in this text of

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.600
Scripture, I would say to you, number one, the first observation that I make from this passage

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.080
is he knows where you are. He knows where you are. And the Bible says to start verse number 48,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.479
"...and he saw them." They didn't see him at this particular point. They're out obeying the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.800
commandment of the Lord. They went, and they got onto the ship, and they're going to cross over.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.320
The Bible says that they were in the midst of the sea, according to verse number 47,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.039
that center, middle section of that verse, as the ship was in the midst of the sea.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:18.959
And so they are going and obeying, doing what they were told to do. And the Bible tells us in verse

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.679
number 48 that he saw them. He saw them toiling and rowing. As we consider the fact, as we would

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:32.959
look at this truth of verse number 48, that he knows where you are, that we'd understand that

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:39.279
they were toiling and rowing, and we understand that that's what they're dealing with. And I want

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.760
you to just focus. Maybe you want to underline. We have three particular thoughts this evening,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.959
and just statements in these verses of Scripture that I hope would be an encouragement to you.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.600
And the first statement that I'd like you to kind of underline or circle in your Bible is,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.799
he saw them. He saw them. We've used that for our title this evening, for this message tonight.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:08.399
But I want you to consider that God knows where you are. He knows where you are. He sees you.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:16.799
And that is an encouraging truth that we find in the Word of God. And the reality is that I've

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:23.119
heard illustrations over the years that have been shared about various life experiences,

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:29.040
and one that comes to mind even as I look at this particular thought in verse number 48, that he,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.600
the Lord Jesus Christ, saw them, is an illustration or a story that I read many years ago about a

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.239
building that was on fire, and the son was on the second floor of this particular building,

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.640
and the father was outside of the building, and he was saying to his son,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:54.239
just jump, I'll catch you. Just jump, I'll catch you. And the boy said repeatedly, but I can't see you.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.880
I can't see you. And he said, it's okay, I can see you. And that's all that matters.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:08.720
And he encouraged that little boy to jump to refuge from that fire, encouraging that little

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.720
boy that though you may not see me, I see you. And how important it is that we get the

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.279
understanding and the encouragement, the comfort of just those simple words in verse number 48,

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:30.880
and he saw them. He saw them. Not only do I notice as we study this portion of Scripture and just kind

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.440
of look at some of these thoughts this evening, not only do I notice that he knows where you are,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.679
but number two, he knows what you're facing. He knows what you're facing. The Bible says that he

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:48.799
saw them. Notice it says, toiling and rowing. Toiling and rowing. As I look at this verse of

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:54.079
Scripture, and I see that terminology that is used in my mind's eye, I see these disciples,

00:06:54.079 --> 00:07:00.160
I mean, they're doing everything they can to get to the other side, and they are just, I mean,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.559
of course, they're used to being on the water. Many of these disciples had been fishermen,

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:08.160
and they understood what it was to be on the water, and they had a level of experience, and

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:14.559
the Bible says, however, they're toiling and rowing. I get in my mind's eye the picture

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:20.720
of these disciples that are doing everything they humanly possibly can do, and they're making no

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.239
progress. And the Bible tells us why they're toiling and rowing. It says, for the wind

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:36.959
was contrary unto them. If you underlined or circled in verse number 48 that first thought,

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:42.399
he saw them, when we think about, make this observation that not only does he know where

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:47.760
you are, but he knows what you're facing, I would say to underline or circle that phrase,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.600
the wind was contrary unto them. You know, there are some times in our lives that we're going to

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.359
face some less than desirable circumstances. There's going to be times that the wind is going

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:05.920
to be contrary to us. And there are times in which, no doubt, if you were to go out on the water,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.040
that there would be times that the wind is favorable to you, and it helps you along your

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.399
journey. But there are other times in which that wind is contrary, and you're doing everything you

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:23.119
can to stay the course and reach the destination. And we find that here, as we look at this portion

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:29.600
of Scripture, that Jesus, God in flesh, that he tells the disciples, in verse number 45,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.080
to get into the ship and to go onto the other side. They obey him. They go into the ship. The

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:43.679
ship is now in the midst of the sea. And yet, the Bible tells us that the wind was contrary unto

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:52.640
them. Unfortunately, in life, there are some that have sought to make this observation or

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.919
declaration that every time you face a trouble or a trial in your life, it's because of some sin in

00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:03.760
your life. Well, that's what the friends of Job tried to say. And we looked at Job last week a

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.599
little bit, and looked at the way in which he would use his words to strengthen others. And

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:16.799
we find here that these disciples did not face a contrary wind because of disobedience.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:23.679
They did not face a contrary wind because of sin. We find that they face this contrary wind,

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:29.359
and God's going to continue to develop them and teach them things. And we find that as you get

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:34.239
to the end of the text, it's kind of interesting that in verse number 52, and we'll see it in a

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:37.679
little bit as well, but it says, "...they considered not the miracle of the loaves,

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:43.039
for their heart was hardened." And we find that the disciples, listen, they're just like we are,

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:48.000
human beings, right? I mean, there are times in which we see great victories. I mean, can you

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.960
imagine the feeding of the 5,000? Can you imagine being one of the disciples and passing out all of

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.520
that and saying, I mean, Andrew said, we don't have enough. I mean, 200 penny worth isn't enough

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.479
to feed. I mean, we got nothing. Send them home. Right? That's what the disciples said.

00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:11.919
And then they take part in seeing this great miracle. Then they take 12 baskets. But see,

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:17.359
sometimes even after we see God work in a great way, we then face another trial and we're like,

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:23.440
oh, this is terrible. What's going to happen? Right? And so Jesus is going to teach them. He's

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.159
going to show them, listen, he knows where we are, but he also knows what we're facing.

00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:33.679
See, the reality is that not everyone knows what you're facing.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:43.919
The reality is that we can face difficulties and trials and storms in our lives that other people

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:47.520
aren't going to understand. They're not going to be aware of. Maybe it's not even appropriate that

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:54.000
other people are aware of all of the storm that we might face. I preached a message not long ago,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.559
just a couple of Sundays ago. And as I preached from Psalms, and I really was dealing with the

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:08.320
truth of really pour out your heart before him in Psalm 62. And what a great truth from that passage

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.359
of scripture that we are to pour out our heart before him. What a great privilege that we have

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:19.919
to do that. But we find that as we look at this portion of scripture and we make some observations,

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:26.559
some simple truths this evening, that he knew where they were. He knows where you are. He knew

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:31.520
what they were facing. He knows what you are facing. He knows what you're dealing with. You

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.599
know that he knows our frame. He made us, right? He knows that we're but dust. He knows the things

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:46.479
that we struggle with. He knows the things that that we're dealing with in life. We find not only

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:50.400
as we look at this portion of scripture, does he know where you are and know what you're facing,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.559
but I would say number three, that he knows what you need. He knows what you need. I want you to

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:03.039
notice in verse number 48, the Bible says, he saw them. That's the first phrase that we said to

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:08.640
circle or underline. He saw them toiling and rowing notice for the wind was contrary to them.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.840
The second thought and about the fourth watch of the night, notice this, he cometh unto them.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.479
He cometh unto them. Isn't that good? He cometh unto them walking upon the sea. It says that he

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:31.440
would have passed by them. I want you to notice that phrase that he cometh unto them. He knows

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.080
where you are. He knows what you're facing and he knows what you need. And here, the Lord Jesus

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.159
Christ, God in flesh, he saw his disciples from the place where he was. The Bible says that he

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:49.919
departed into a mountain to pray in verse number 46. And he saw his disciples. He knew where they

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:56.320
were. He knew what they were facing and he knew what they needed. And so he went to them. He went

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.840
to them. It says that he cometh unto them. We understand that during the earthly ministry of

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:13.119
the Lord Jesus Christ that God took upon himself human form. And we understand the hypostatic union

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:18.799
and all that goes into it. The God-man as we'd refer to the Lord Jesus Christ. And we look at

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:24.320
Philippians chapter number two and what powerful truth God gives us with regard to the incarnation

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:33.039
and the deity of Christ. And we find that during the earthly ministry that he physically could be

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:39.359
in the presence of his disciples. And then there were times in which he was physically not in the

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:45.440
presence of the disciples. As New Testament believers, after the ascension of the Lord

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.719
Jesus Christ, remember he said in John chapter number 14 to the disciples, he said it a couple

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:55.599
of times in the book of John, that it was expedient. It was beneficial for them that he go away. Why?

00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:59.919
He's going to send the Comforter. He's going to send the Holy Spirit. We find that he promised us

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:06.000
according to what we read in Hebrews 13, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. What a tremendous

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.559
promise. See God knows where you are. He knows what you're facing and he knows exactly what you need.

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:21.840
The Bible says that he cometh unto them. It says walking upon the sea. Now this is something

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.119
interesting about the scriptures. There are times in which there are statements that are made that

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.840
are just a few words of statement that carry with it such profound truth. Walking upon the sea. I

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.640
mean, if you're not careful, you just read right past that. But he's walking on the sea. We know

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.760
about Peter, right? When Peter said, if it be thou bid me come unto thee and Peter went out,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.000
walked in the water until he looked at the storm and began to sink. And he was wise enough to say,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.919
Lord save me or help me. And what a blessing that is that he was helped. But we find here

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.960
that Jesus is the creator of all things. He's able to do all things and he's walking upon the sea.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:06.799
And it says that he would have passed by them. And I want you to keep that thought and I want you to

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:12.479
go over, if you will, to the book of John in the sixth chapter. And John chapter number six is,

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:17.840
of course, from John's perspective, as he would write about this same event.

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:26.479
We find that the feeding of the 5,000 is just a great miracle that is referenced. And what a

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:31.599
blessing to be able to read about that and to rejoice. We see in verse number 10, at the end of

00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:36.159
the verse, it says, so the men sat down and number about 5,000 and they gathered up the fragments

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:42.000
that remained in verse number 12. And they filled the baskets in verse number 13. But you see that

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:48.479
they filled the baskets in verse number 13. But you see that the similarity, the event that is

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.799
being recorded between Mark chapter number six and John chapter number six, and the way that

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:58.559
John records it in verse number 18, he says, and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:03.679
So when they had rowed about five and 20 or 30 furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea

00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:09.599
and drawing nigh into the ship. And they were afraid. He says unto them, it is I be not afraid.

00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:16.479
Notice this truth in verse number 21. Then they willingly received him into the ship.

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:21.599
And we compare scripture with scripture. You find it's not a contradiction. No way.

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:25.840
The Bible doesn't contradict itself, but you read at the end of verse number 48, that it says that

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.200
he would have passed by them. And in John's account, he doesn't reference about the fact

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.840
that he might have passed by or he would have passed by them. But he says that they willingly

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:43.119
received him into the ship. This evening, we must understand that God knows what we need,

00:16:43.119 --> 00:16:51.679
but he never forces himself upon us. Are we willing to receive what he knows that we need?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.039
See, sometimes in life, we think we know what we need, right? We think we got to figure it out.

00:16:57.039 --> 00:17:02.400
Sometimes even we try to help God when we pray. We pray about something and offer to God a way in

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.439
which he could answer it. And maybe he could answer it in that way. He's God, but he knows

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:12.560
exactly what we need. And the Bible tells us that he would have passed by them in Mark's gospel.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.640
And John says that they willingly received him into the ship. And then it says immediately the

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.839
ship was at the land where they went. And so we find that they saw him walking in the sea. We

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:28.160
read it in verse number 49. Back in Mark chapter number six, they supposed it had been a spirit

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.119
and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled. Immediately he talked with them and

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:38.800
saith unto them, be of good cheer. It is I, be not afraid. Aren't you thankful for those words

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:48.959
of the Lord Jesus Christ here in verse number 50? He says, be of good cheer. It is I, be not afraid.

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:57.359
Not only were they in midst of a storm, but they see Jesus walking upon the sea. And they supposed,

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:01.839
according to verse number 49, that it had been a spirit and they cried out. The Bible says that

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:07.199
they were troubled literally in verse number 50, carries with it the idea of being terrified

00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:17.359
at that which was taking place. And Jesus says, be of good cheer. It is I, be not afraid.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.079
And I want you to notice one final statement from this passage of scripture

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.640
that I'd like for you to underline or circle. It's in verse number 51 when the Bible says that

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:40.479
he went up unto them. He went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore

00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:48.160
amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered. Do you notice as we look at these four statements

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.359
that I've asked you to underline or circle in your Bibles this evening or to take note of

00:18:54.239 --> 00:19:00.079
them in your notes? He knows where you are. The first statement found in verse number 48,

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:07.280
he saw them. He saw them. Again, in verse number 48, the wind was contrary unto them.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:13.359
He knew where they were and he knew what they were facing, but he knew what they needed. And we find

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:20.079
that in verse number 48, it says he cometh unto them. And then in verse number 51, he went up

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.400
unto them. And the Bible tells us in this particular miracle that is given to us,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.079
recorded for us in this passage of scripture, that when he went up unto them in verse number 51 into

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:41.680
the ship, the Bible says that the wind ceased. The wind ceased. The Bible tells us that they

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.359
were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered. These disciples during their

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:53.839
walk with the Lord Jesus Christ had the privilege of seeing the storm become more than once.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:02.959
And as we would give the attention here and see the power of our God over nature.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.040
And the Bible says that, remember what John said in John chapter number 6, that they willingly

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.520
received him into the ship. And I think that it's important for us to understand that they

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.640
willingly received him to the ship. And it says to us in verse number 51 of Mark 6, that he went

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:28.319
up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased. The wind ceased. See this evening, as we look at

00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:32.880
this portion of scripture, and it's a great miracle that was performed, no doubt the Lord

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:40.160
is seeking to develop his disciples. And he gave them the direction to go onto the, into the ship

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.880
and to go onto the other side, unto Bethsaida. And they were obedient to the direction that the

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.880
Lord had given. And we find that there's this storm and we notice all those things are taking

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.760
place. But this evening, I want you to think about your life. And I want you to understand that he

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.560
sees you. We can look here and see that it says he saw them. We can speak about the disciples that

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:11.280
were in the boat, in the ship, but he sees you. He knows where you are. Where they were is not where

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.520
we are. Right? I'm not in the middle of a ship or in the middle of a sea. I'm not on a ship.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.640
I don't plan to go on too many ships. Amen. It's not really my cup of tea, if you understand.

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:31.359
Joseph's not too excited about ships either. And, but the reality is that they're in a different

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:36.319
place than where we are. And I'm in a different place than you are. And the person on the other

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:39.520
side of the auditorium is in a different place than you are. The person in the front of the

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:46.319
auditorium is in a different place. You understand what I'm saying. But the omniscient Almighty God

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.040
sees you. He knows where you are. Where they were was in the ship on the sea.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.640
And what they were facing was a storm. The wind was contrary unto them. And he knew what they

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.959
were dealing with. He knew what they were facing. I'm not facing a contrary wind on a ship.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.400
On a sea. But you're facing something different than I'm facing.

00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:24.160
We understand. But he knows what you're facing. Individually. He sees you. He knows what you're

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:31.520
facing. And let me say this. He knows what you need. He knows better what you need than what

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.040
you think you need. He knows better what you need than what I think you need.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.760
Or than your spouse thinks that you need or whatever, right? He knows what we need.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:51.760
And here's the wonderful thing. He can meet that need. He can meet that need. He is able.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:59.119
And this evening, I hope that we could just be comforted for a few moments as we look at this

00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:07.520
portion of scripture and think about those phrases. He saw them. He saw them. And this

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:16.479
evening, I don't know. Maybe you're the only person in the room that knows what you're dealing with.

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:23.760
But don't forget that God knows what you're dealing with. And really, that's the most

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.119
important, is it not? Because he can do for you what no one else can do for you.

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:33.839
And this evening, these disciples in Mark chapter number 6, they got to see a great miracle. They

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:39.359
saw that the wind ceased when he came up in the ship. And you know, the reality is that

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.920
God's still working miracles today in your life, in my life. He still answers prayer. He still

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.880
meets the needs. He still works and does exceeding abundantly above all that we could ask or think.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.760
Because we serve the Lord God omnipotent. And what a joy it is to know this evening

00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:05.599
that he knows where we are. He knows what we're facing and he knows what we need.

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:09.280
Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us.

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:14.400
Just a simple thought this evening from this portion of scripture.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:25.760
But I know this evening that you helped me personally as I prepared, even as I delivered.

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:32.239
God, I pray that this evening your word has helped your people tonight.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.400
Those that are gathered locally, those who have tuned in via live stream,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:51.040
that we'd be encouraged tonight as we understand and observe these simple truths that you know

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:58.319
where we are, you know what we're facing, and you know what we need. We trust you. I pray that you'd

00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:03.359
help us to submit to you. I pray that you'd work through our time of prayer that you alone would

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:07.680
be glorified. For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
