1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,199
Tower of Babel, the Tower of Babel here in Genesis 11, verses 1 through 9.

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,060
Last week, as you will recall, we had the opportunity to examine Genesis chapter number

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:17,840
10, and as we studied through the 10th chapter of the book of Genesis, I made note that really

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,639
that passage of Scripture was providing us with an overview or a summary of the disbursement

5
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:30,420
of mankind, while we find in the first nine verses of chapter number 11 that the details

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,979
of that event are provided to us.

7
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:39,520
And so we begin to look at the 11th chapter, and this of course recording for us this subject

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,740
of the Tower of Babel, the disbursement of mankind.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,680
Now you understand that as we've studied through these first 10 chapters, and now as we get

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,819
into the 11th chapter here of the book of Genesis, you've understood that we've mentioned

11
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,819
often that these 11 chapters of Genesis are under constant attack.

12
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:05,099
And we understand that those that we would maybe look at as being mockers and scoffers,

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,860
that they seek to undermine the foundation and authority of the Word of God.

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,099
And we find that they really attack the 11 chapters, the first 11 chapters of the book

15
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:20,180
of Genesis, and as they attack these 11 chapters and they deal with, even in chapter number

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,379
10, the genealogies that are provided here, the event in chapter 11, and then the subsequent

17
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,739
genealogy, and you find that as they attack all of these records that are given, that

18
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:35,779
not only in attacking the foundation, but again, we see the undermining of the authority

19
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,220
of God's Word.

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,980
Unfortunately, there have been many over the centuries that have caved in, that they've

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,819
given in to the pressures of the mockers and the scoffers, and they said, well, yeah, maybe

22
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,620
it could be that way, and maybe that is another possibility, and all of a sudden what you're

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,779
doing is you're putting holes in what God has told us, and then you go to other portions

24
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:03,860
of Scripture and say, well, how is that going to have any level of authority if this is

25
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
not authoritative?

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,259
And so, there's a plan, and we find that, of course, the enemy is behind that plan to

27
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,940
attack the Word of God.

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,139
We see it in Genesis chapter number 3, yea, hath God said, right?

29
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:19,660
And we find that that's what He says to Eve in the garden, and we find that that process

30
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,259
has continued on throughout the centuries.

31
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,179
As we come here, notice in verse number 1 in Genesis 11, the whole earth was of one

32
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:31,740
language and of one speech, and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,059
they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

34
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:39,779
And they said one to another, go to, let us make brick, and burned them throughly.

35
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:43,240
And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,199
And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven,

37
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,960
and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,520
And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,160
The Lord said, behold, the people is one.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,000
They have all one language, and this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
from them which they have imagined to do.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,080
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,800
one another's speech.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,880
So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth, and they left

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,080
off to build the city.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,559
Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language

47
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:33,720
of all the earth, and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
all the earth.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,600
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message The Tower of Babel,

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,160
and number one in your notes this evening, notice the place.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,639
It's given to us in verses one and two, again in verse number nine, and as we begin to do

52
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,279
some research and go back into the 10th chapter, we'll remind ourselves of the fact of this

53
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,279
one Nimrod.

54
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:55,320
We are introduced to him in verse number nine of Genesis 10, where the Bible says that he

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,020
was, and really verse number eight talks about that Cush begat Nimrod, he began to be a mighty

56
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
one in the earth.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,520
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord, wherefore it is said, even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
before the Lord, in the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
And so we find here in verses one and two, the Bible tells us, it's giving us, setting

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,160
the scene, if you will, as to what's going on, and the Bible tells us that they journeyed,

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,359
and they found this plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

62
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,839
The Bible tells us in verse number nine, therefore is the name of it called Babel.

63
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,679
And so we understand the place in which God is speaking of.

64
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:34,220
Now it's interesting as we begin to understand what's taking place and what's transpiring

65
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,500
here in these verses as we are introduced to Genesis chapter 11 and the Tower of Babel

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,739
and all that's taking place, we find that really there's a striking similarity between

67
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:50,899
what we begin seeing here in Genesis chapter 11 and what we read of in Revelation 17 and

68
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,899
18.

69
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,059
We'll make some reference to that as we go through the message this evening, but we find

70
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:59,859
that of course, even as we made note last week when we looked at this place called Babel,

71
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:04,420
when we look at Babylonia and Babylon, it's a word that is used familiar throughout the

72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Old Testament.

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:13,059
In fact, we find that the people of God, the nation of Judah, was taken captive by the

74
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,059
Babylonians.

75
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:18,040
And we can read of that, and we can understand Jeremiah, of course, prophesying on the eve

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,980
of captivity and all of those things that transpire.

77
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:28,019
And as we begin to think about the place Babel or Babylon, we find today that would be in

78
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,380
modern day Iraq.

79
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,459
And so that's the place in which is being spoken of here, and it's a place where they

80
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,540
found and obviously it was a place where they desired to stay and they dwelt there.

81
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,059
Now let's dig into the plan.

82
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:46,100
In verses three and four, we find there's a plan that is made, and it's interesting,

83
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,820
they use this terminology on two occasions, go to.

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,660
And you'll see in verse number three, it says, they said one to another, go to, and then

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,579
again in verse number four, and they said, go to.

86
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,420
You'll see that God will use that same vernacular in verse number seven as He begins to deal

87
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,339
with what it is that He's going to do, His response to their plan.

88
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,739
But we find that as we begin to dissect their plan and really understand what's taking place,

89
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:16,820
and it's almost as if that this, the people that are dwelling here, that they're gathered

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,459
together, there's some type of a meeting that takes place, and they're determining this

91
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:26,260
is the path in which we're going to go forward.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,179
And they use that terminology, go to, and they say this, let us make brick, notice in

93
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,619
verse number three, and burn them throughly, and it begins to deal with the materials in

94
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,739
which they would use for their purpose of building.

95
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,640
It says that they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar.

96
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,660
We find that not only did they desire to have the materials, but they explain, we find here

97
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,480
what their logic was and what it was that they were seeking to build.

98
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,720
It was a city and a tower, according to verse number four.

99
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,320
It says whose top may reach unto heaven, and notice this phrase, and let us make us a name.

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,959
And let us make us a name.

101
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:13,720
Now we find that it then says lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

102
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Now there are several observations that we make as we begin to look at verses three and

103
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:25,320
four and begin to dissect the plan that these people had here in this passage of Scripture.

104
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,600
Number one, you will know, obviously, that they sought no direction from the Lord.

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,760
There's no reference that we find in the passage of Scripture where they were seeking the face

106
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,640
of God with regard to this project, with regard to that which they were setting out to do.

107
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,519
Now we understand as God's people, and even as we study through the Scriptures, that you

108
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,760
find many times the people of God are requesting direction from the Lord.

109
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,480
They're seeking the face of God for direction.

110
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,619
We find ourselves in our lives as we pray about decisions and we pray that God would

111
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:04,600
lead us in a plain path, that he would give us clarity and wisdom with regard to the decisions

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,359
that we have to make.

113
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:12,040
We thank the Lord that he will provide leadership to us in our lives, but we find that here

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,959
as you read Genesis chapter 11, there is an obvious omission of anyone seeking direction

115
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,559
from the Lord God Almighty.

116
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:22,079
They are not seeking the face of God.

117
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,760
In fact, we would find that they really don't want God to be part of their plan.

118
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,119
We find that they were in direct rebellion to God's instruction.

119
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:39,919
See, in Genesis chapter 9, after Noah and his family got off of the ark, the end of

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,960
chapter number 8 records that for us, and it tells us that they made these offerings,

121
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,200
and what a blessing to understand how they behaved after they departed from the ark.

122
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,599
And we come to the ninth chapter of the book of Genesis, and God says this in verse number

123
00:08:55,599 --> 00:09:02,000
1, and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and replenish

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,500
the earth.

125
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,260
And here we find that these individuals at Babel, that they have this idea, they say

126
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,419
at the end of verse number 4, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

127
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:21,299
They were in direct rebellion, in fact, to what God had given instruction to do.

128
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,000
We find that they sought to make a name for themselves.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,140
We notice that phraseology in verse number 4, and let us make us a name.

130
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:35,900
It's a very significant aspect of what's going on here, because really what they're doing

131
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,859
is they're elevating man.

132
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,260
It's really this idea of humanism.

133
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,840
It starts all the way back here in Genesis chapter 11, and it's interesting, I looked

134
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,059
up a quick definition for humanism, and I'm going to share with you a thought from an

135
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,739
article that actually is in a magazine called The Humanist.

136
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:56,460
I've shared this in the past, but I think it's pertinent to the subject this evening.

137
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,859
Humanism is an outlook or system of thought that's attached to the humanist.

138
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:03,519
attaching prime importance to human

139
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,179
rather than divine or supernatural matters.

140
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:13,419
Humanist beliefs stress the potential value

141
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,139
and goodness of human beings.

142
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,379
They emphasize common human needs,

143
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,239
and they seek solely rational ways

144
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,299
of solving human problems.

145
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,679
Do we not see this mindset

146
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,939
in the society in which we live today?

147
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,639
Humanism, right?

148
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,919
It's very, very familiar to us,

149
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,459
and we see it as a very popular form of thinking,

150
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,659
and we find that here,

151
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:44,479
that in this beginning of chapter 11,

152
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,999
as we begin to think about the Tower of Babel,

153
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,419
one of what they were doing

154
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,119
is let us make a name,

155
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,959
let us make us a name,

156
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,879
and this idea of humanism elevating man.

157
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,679
And notice, as we would think about

158
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,479
this subject of humanism,

159
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:00,559
this is an article that's from the,

160
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,599
again, it's a periodical, a magazine called The Humanist,

161
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:07,679
and this article appeared over 30 years ago.

162
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,479
Now, you think about that.

163
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,919
This has been an agenda within our society

164
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,959
for a lengthy period of time,

165
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,119
but let me read this to you.

166
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,119
I'm gonna go through the length

167
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,159
of reading the entirety

168
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,519
of this particular section of the article.

169
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,119
It says, these people consider themselves

170
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,399
to be brave pioneers,

171
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,719
teaching the truth about man's origin

172
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,959
and facing death and extinction with valor.

173
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,739
They worship at the altar of Darwinian evolution.

174
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,079
They are, the writer says,

175
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,899
I am convinced more interested

176
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,359
in promoting their philosophy's anti-Christian agenda

177
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,479
than a scientific one.

178
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,839
Their agenda is very simple.

179
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,479
Get the biblical God out of the picture

180
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,039
and replace it with a humanistic worldview.

181
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,479
Man is the ultimate authority

182
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,439
to determine truth apart from God.

183
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:54,959
Darwinianism is arguably the most popular form of humanism.

184
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,999
Here's the exact quote.

185
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:57,839
It says this,

186
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,319
I am convinced that the battle for humankind's future

187
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,559
must be waged and won,

188
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,799
notice where they say,

189
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,799
in the public school classroom

190
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,759
by teachers who correctly perceive their role

191
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,079
as the proselytizers of a new faith,

192
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,559
a religion of humanity

193
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,999
that recognizes and respects the spark

194
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:24,019
of what theologians call divinity in every human being.

195
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,139
These teachers, what teachers?

196
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,899
The one in this public school classroom.

197
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,159
These teachers must embody the same selfless dedication

198
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,279
as the most rabid fundamentalist preachers.

199
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,379
Wow.

200
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,819
Says that they will be ministers of another sort,

201
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,099
utilizing a classroom instead of a pulpit

202
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,299
to convey humanist values in whatever subject they teach,

203
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,979
regardless of the educational level,

204
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:56,419
preschool, daycare, or large state university.

205
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:00,239
The classroom must and will become an arena of conflict

206
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,779
between the old and the new,

207
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,579
the rotting corpse of Christianity

208
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,579
together with all its adjacent evils and misery,

209
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:09,319
and the new faith of humanism.

210
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:13,179
And really we've seen that in our culture, in our society,

211
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,339
but it's nothing new.

212
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,819
There's nothing new under the sun, right?

213
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,059
We see all the way back here in Genesis

214
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,699
at the Tower of Babel, what are they trying to do?

215
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,679
It's this humanistic mind view,

216
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,879
let us make us a name, removing God,

217
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,119
really this kind of a one world order, if you will,

218
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,759
or system, which of course Satan is behind.

219
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,839
We find that Satan has always favored a one world system.

220
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,679
Why?

221
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,199
Because it's in that one world system

222
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,199
where he can centralize things

223
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,279
that allows for him to have an opportunity

224
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,719
to effectually seek control.

225
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,839
By the way, that's what Satan wants.

226
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,399
He wants control.

227
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,479
And if he can have a one world system,

228
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,119
and that's the goal of the evil one,

229
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,399
and we understand that during the millennial reign of Christ

230
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,699
that Jesus will rule and reign for 1,000 years,

231
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,999
but the counterfeit, the counterpart,

232
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,579
we find that Satan will seek to have government

233
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:10,319
and religious bodies under this one system, if you will,

234
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,579
and we find it starting all the way back here

235
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,679
in Genesis chapter 11.

236
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,759
And really we find that as we would consider

237
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,959
the role of Babylon throughout the history,

238
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,359
and we begin to think about the religious,

239
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:27,199
just the number of false religions

240
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,599
that have come out of Babylon,

241
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,159
you begin to see all of those things.

242
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,799
And then you come to Revelation 17 and 18,

243
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,559
and you begin to see there about the references

244
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,119
of not only religious Babylon, but commercial Babylon.

245
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,879
And we see that here,

246
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,239
it would seem that in Revelation 17 and 18,

247
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:49,000
it's not speaking about the specific geographical location

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,399
that is the same location as we find there

249
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,559
in Genesis chapter 11,

250
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,319
but we find that the system, if you will,

251
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,239
is the same idea,

252
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,879
and we find that it is still being controlled

253
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,519
by none other than Satan.

254
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,159
We'll make some notes of Revelation 17 and 18 here

255
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,339
in just a few moments,

256
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,679
but as we begin to see the plan that these individuals have

257
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,599
and we begin to see how that they have this plan

258
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,939
and it's going to be a plan

259
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,839
that they can see it to its fruition

260
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,399
and man, this is a good plan.

261
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,559
They've had their counsel, if you will,

262
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,159
and they've made their decisions.

263
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,479
No doubt, Nimrod has some part

264
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,399
within this entire situation for the Bible,

265
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,000
refers to him as being a mighty one in the earth

266
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,839
and a mighty hunter.

267
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,799
And we find that that carries with it

268
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,799
that idea of having this level of control and power.

269
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,719
They've made these decisions

270
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,879
as a result of perhaps a council type of a meeting

271
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,519
that they had as to what they were going to do

272
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,559
and here was their decision.

273
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,799
Here was their plan and it's unfolded for us.

274
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,539
The remainder of the passage in verses five through nine

275
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,279
deals with the punishment.

276
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,759
We've noticed the place, we see the plan.

277
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,799
Now notice the punishment.

278
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,319
Though man had excluded God from their plans,

279
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,639
it's interesting as we read the text of Scripture

280
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,119
that we see so clearly how that God is well aware

281
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:19,359
of all that is taking place upon His earth.

282
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,239
There's nothing hid from the Lord, amen?

283
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,599
Our God is omniscient, our God is omnipotent,

284
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:28,039
our God knows everything, He sees everything,

285
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,119
and we find that He is aware of that which is taking place.

286
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,299
It's interesting in verse number five

287
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,439
how that the author gives us really a view

288
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,679
of the fact that the Bible says

289
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,759
the Lord came down to see the city and the tower.

290
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,399
The reality is that God saw it and knew what was going on,

291
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,079
but we have this relational experience

292
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,839
that is given in verse number five

293
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,719
to help really see the interaction

294
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,319
that God Almighty has with His creation.

295
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,439
And it's as if, as we look at the passage,

296
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,759
it says that the Lord came down to see the city

297
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,319
and the tower which the children of men builded.

298
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,279
And we find that here, as we would look at this reference

299
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,559
and we would see what's happening,

300
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,359
we'd see the punishment that is given,

301
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,319
and we find that God is well aware.

302
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,599
Remember, they never consulted with God.

303
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,079
They never sought counsel from the face of the Lord.

304
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,799
We find that they simply made this decision.

305
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,399
They were going to go in this direction apart from God.

306
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,919
We don't need God, we don't want God,

307
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,959
was really their idea, their mindset.

308
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,199
Let us make a name for us and let us do this thing.

309
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,139
But God was well aware of all that was taking place.

310
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,819
It is interesting as a side note

311
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,559
before we get into all of the punishment that is given here,

312
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,139
it would seem that as we look at verse number 25

313
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,719
of Genesis chapter number 10,

314
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,599
and I made note of this last week,

315
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,439
the Bible tells us, and unto Eber were born two sons,

316
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,919
the name of the one was Peleg,

317
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,000
for in his days was the earth divided,

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,279
and his brother's name was Joctan.

319
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,599
And as we look at that phrase in verse number 25

320
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,239
with regard to Peleg, the Bible says,

321
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:01,039
in his days was the earth divided.

322
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,679
It's important for us to understand

323
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,399
a little bit of what's going on here

324
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,199
from a timeline perspective.

325
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,199
Why do we say that?

326
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,319
Because of a phrase that is given in verse number six,

327
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,199
we want to make sure that we have

328
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,119
a proper understanding of this.

329
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,319
Notice the Bible says in verse number six of Genesis 11,

330
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,879
and the Lord said, behold, the people is one

331
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,000
and they all have one language.

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,439
And this they begin to do.

333
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:28,039
Notice, and now nothing will be restrained from them

334
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,539
which they have imagined to do.

335
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,279
Now you understand that that is not God saying

336
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,719
that they could do something beyond the ability

337
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,079
for God to restrain them.

338
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,599
God is very able to restrain mankind.

339
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,440
He is all power.

340
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,119
He is the omnipotent one.

341
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,000
And so it's not a reference to the fact

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that mankind was in this place of a unified agenda

343
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,260
that was not going to be able to be restrained from God.

344
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,880
Rather, as we would look at the timeline of what's going on

345
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,500
and we think about a godly influence,

346
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,200
not only through Noah, but through the sons of Shem,

347
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,880
and the inability of those, that godly influence

348
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,919
to have an impact upon this wicked agenda

349
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,599
that is being planned here in Genesis 11,

350
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,880
verses three and four.

351
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,820
There's this wicked agenda that's going forth.

352
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,399
Now, we understand that the reality is that,

353
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,919
well, let me back up and say this.

354
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,640
In Genesis chapter number 10, we see that the Bible tells us

355
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,079
that it was in the days of Peleg that the earth was divided.

356
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,359
Now, go further into Genesis chapter 11 with me,

357
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,200
and let me read.

358
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm gonna get into this passage

359
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,039
in a couple of Sunday nights,

360
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,279
but let me begin reading in verse number 10.

361
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,979
We'll deal with the entirety in a couple of weeks,

362
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:44,820
but notice this.

363
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,779
It says, these are the generations of Shem.

364
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,799
Shem was 100 years old and began,

365
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,320
our facts add, two years after the flood.

366
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,640
Now, notice that, two years, right?

367
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,079
It's important that we note that,

368
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,200
two years after the flood.

369
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Notice in verse number 11,

370
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
and Shem lived after he began.

371
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,460
Arphaxad 500 years begat sons and daughters and then Arphaxad lived 5 and 30 years, right?

372
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,700
And so we see that's 35 years after but there were two years

373
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,740
So now we're what we're 37 years after the flood you follow the timeline

374
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,580
So we're 37 years after the flood according to verse number 12

375
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,340
He lived after he begat Sela

376
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,420
403 years begat sons and daughters notice verse 14 and Sela lived 30 years and begat Eber now 30 years plus

377
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:35,620
37 is 67 right? We're good keeping track 67 years after the flood according to verse number 14

378
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,340
Verse number 15 Sela lived after he begat Eber 403 years

379
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,020
We got sons and daughters Eber lived 4 and 30 years and begat Peleg

380
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,180
So 4 and 30 years plus 67 years is 101 years. I do the math, right you mathematicians. We're good

381
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,020
Amen, so we're 101 years after the flood when Peleg was born

382
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,460
The Bible tells us in chapter number 10 in verse number 25 and his days was the earth divided

383
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,420
And so he was born a hundred and one years after the flood

384
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:12,580
The Bible tells us if you continue to read in the passage of Scripture in verse number 17 and Eber lived after he begat Peleg

385
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
430 years and begat sons and daughters

386
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,740
And then it tells us in verse number 18 and Peleg lived 30 years begat Reu and Peleg lived after we got Reu

387
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,880
209 years. So the total lifespan of Peleg is

388
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:32,900
239 years. Are you tracking? We're good. How do we get 239 years in verse 19?

389
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
You're looking like you're not good

390
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,300
209 years after he begat Reu and he was 30 years old and begat Reu and according to verse number 18

391
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,580
All right, we're good 239 years

392
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,880
So if he was born a hundred and one years after the flood and he died when he was 239, how old was he?

393
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Or how many years sorry after the flood he died he was doing during now when he died not a trick question

394
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
How many years post flood are we?

395
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:06,040
340 right? We're 340 years post flood. We track in how many years did Noah live after the flood?

396
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
350

397
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,380
Interesting right look at the end of chapter number 9 chapter 9 in verse 28 and Noah lived after the flood

398
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
350 years

399
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,740
So it seemed very obvious that Noah was alive during this account of the Tower of Babel

400
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,140
I'm pretty confident that Noah would not have been supportive of their agenda

401
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,940
Okay, we don't see any reference in here of Noah's interaction

402
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,700
in fact

403
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,500
At the end of chapter 9 is the last that we see in recorded scripture of any real specifics with regard to the life of Noah

404
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
But we find that I will tell us that he lived

405
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,100
350 years after the flood if these events that we're looking at of the Tower of Babel if this took place

406
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
after the flood by

407
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,540
340 years at the most right because that's when Peleg died

408
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:07,460
340 years after the flood it says that it was in the days that the earth was divided in the days of Peleg

409
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
And so therefore it could be anywhere

410
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,220
Prior to 340, but definitely not further than 340 years

411
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,120
So therefore Noah was alive. No doubt. We find that he would not have been supportive of this agenda

412
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,060
Perhaps even as he was remember Noah was known as being what a preacher of righteousness, right?

413
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,180
Noah preached before the flood did he not we find that he was a preacher and he was

414
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,420
Preaching and we understand that people weren't responding to the message

415
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,620
And it was just Noah and his wife as three sons and their wives that got on the ark

416
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,140
We find that he was a faithful preacher

417
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,380
And so we find that as we begin to look at what's taking place here in chapter number

418
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,540
11 and verse number 6 the Bible says that nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do

419
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,640
I believe is in my as I begin to look at this begin to consider all that's taking place to begin to

420
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,960
Think about some that would be crying out

421
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,400
Maybe Noah and others of that godly line that would be crying out against the plan of this

422
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Agenda that is going forth by Nimrod and these within Babel of all that's taking place

423
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
And yet we find that they were being drowned out

424
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,760
They were not being listened to and of course we find that even as we begin to study New Testament Christianity

425
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,480
We begin to understand the church age if we begin to look at what the Bible tells us

426
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Let me make a mention to 2nd Thessalonians and let's look at this verse real quick and 2nd Thessalonians chapter number 2

427
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
in 2nd Thessalonians chapter number 2

428
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,200
We find that the Bible is giving some truth here with regard

429
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,800
To the last days these believers in Thessalonica had been deceived with regard

430
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,800
to the day of the Lord and some things that had been taking place and we find

431
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,800
That as we come into the second chapter here of the book of 2nd Thessalonians and verse number 5

432
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,559
Paul says remember ye not that when I was with you yet with you

433
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:08,640
I told you these things and now you know what withhold it that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity

434
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Doth already work

435
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,880
Only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way verse number 7 is

436
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Referring to the Holy Spirit of God

437
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,160
When it talks about only he who now let us will let we think about the restraining power of the Holy Spirit of God

438
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,880
And it talks about this in in verse number 7 the mystery of iniquity doth already work and then it tells us in verse Marie

439
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
and then

440
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,760
shall that

441
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,840
wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming if you

442
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,960
Look back in verses 3 and 4 of this same passage

443
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,820
You begin to see that he's talking about the midpoint of the tribulation

444
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,160
When the son of perdition should be revealed and so on and so forth and we can look back in Daniel 9 and see how all

445
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,040
of that

446
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,400
Maps out as being the midpoint of the tribulation. And so why do I make this reference?

447
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,960
Well, the reality is that there's a plan the mystery of iniquity doth already work

448
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,200
But as the church is here and as we are filled with the Holy Spirit of God and doing the work of God

449
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,520
There is a restraining power to what the wicked is able to accomplish

450
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,440
But we know that the wicked is against God. We understand that we understand their plan, right? It's a humanistic mindset

451
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,840
It's an agenda that is void of any reference to God any need for God, but we understand that man needs God, right?

452
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,920
we understand that man has been created in the image of God that

453
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,880
The that not only is God the creator

454
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,960
But he is the Redeemer of mankind and just as we'd find in Romans chapter number one

455
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,800
We don't time to go there this evening. We would find that they seek to

456
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Come to a place where they can deny the existence of God so that they are not accountable to God as

457
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,720
We look back in Genesis chapter 11 begin to see this punishment and I begin to understand that this is very

458
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,160
Interesting when we see the power of God and you see what's happening now

459
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,720
I don't know the timeline exactly of how long or how far they got into their building process

460
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,800
but just in your sanctified imagination this evening just know that there's somewhere in the process of

461
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,040
Building this city and this tower and they're doing this work. They're they're making the brick. They're

462
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Burning them through Lee. They have the slime from order. They're doing this again

463
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,040
I don't know how far into the process they are

464
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,400
We find that God is aware of what man is doing and we find that God's plan is

465
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,080
Simple and effective and it just makes me laugh. I mean God is so powerful

466
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,320
man is so

467
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
finite right and God is so

468
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:55,160
infinite begin to think about all of this plan of man and what they're doing here in battle and we're gonna do this and we're

469
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,400
Gonna do that. We're gonna make a name and it's like God's like I can just do one simple little thing and it all comes

470
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,279
To naught the power of God. It's such a listen. He doesn't destroy them

471
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
He could have we see what happened with the flood, right?

472
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,920
He doesn't destroy them, but we find that the plan is a simple yet effective plan notice in verse number seven

473
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
go to

474
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,520
Let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's

475
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,279
speech

476
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,660
Now, can you imagine I mean again my sanctified imagination, right? This is comical to me

477
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,739
Because I'm thinking in my sanctified imagination. We all ended work on Thursday afternoon evening

478
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:45,619
We finished up we got our much of the project done that we got done. We go home. We'll see in the morning

479
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,299
Here's the plan for tomorrow. We have all of this sort of thing. We get up Friday morning

480
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,820
We come to the job site and we can't understand each other

481
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,059
Would that be frustrating

482
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,700
Have you ever tried to talk to somebody that you couldn't speak their language and they couldn't speak your language

483
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:05,679
Have you come on it's frustrating

484
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,739
right

485
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,059
You you get on the phone

486
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,900
I remember the very first time and when I was in the corporate world the very first time I had to deal with a customer

487
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,780
That was from a foreign country and they were speaking as much English as they knew and I met you it was three words

488
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,780
And I had no idea where they were coming from what their language was and I was just all sorts of messed up and I

489
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
remember sitting in the office and I was talking extremely slow and

490
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:34,419
Extremely loud and I just kept saying the same and I just kind of smacked myself afterwards

491
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:40,220
I said it really doesn't matter how slow or how loud I speak if they don't understand English. They don't understand English, right?

492
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,299
It's just not gonna happen and you're trying to communicate

493
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,299
frustrating

494
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,419
Becky was telling us a story when they were here a couple of weeks ago

495
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,500
about when they moved to England and they were trying to get their power turned on and they were going through the process and

496
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,619
Shane came home from work and said so did you get everything taken care of with the power company? She said I think so

497
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,759
He's like, what do you mean you think so? She said I have no idea what they said on the phone

498
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,199
She said in fact as we were talking I said

499
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:09,319
I know that you're speaking English and so am I and I should understand you but I don't

500
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,599
They were both speaking English and they couldn't understand each other because of an accent

501
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,359
Shane in his

502
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,439
man style and I say that ma n n

503
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,239
We can handle this like just give me five minutes and I'll take care of this and make a phone call

504
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:31,199
All right, and Shane got on the phone. He's like, honey. I have no idea what they're saying

505
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,559
This is kind of comical, but can you imagine?

506
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,199
Going to the job site. I mean these people again. I don't know how long they had been working on the project

507
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:45,239
I don't know how long this has been going on the scriptures don't tell us but no doubt

508
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:51,399
They're somewhere into the project. They'd been working and they show up at the job site and now they can't communicate

509
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:56,039
God's plan is simple. It's very effective

510
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:02,119
We find that it resulted in the bit in the in the human beings being scattered, you notice in verse number eight

511
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:07,719
So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city

512
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,199
It is estimated today

513
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:14,999
And really you can look at some different things as to the number of languages that are that out there today

514
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:20,479
Conservatively, it's about 6,500 languages. That's a lot of languages

515
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:25,039
I'm not a linguist in any shape way shape or form

516
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,959
Languages are not my gift being able to learn a language is not very simple for me

517
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:35,279
And I have tried and maybe I just need to put forth more effort

518
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:42,639
but I understand that out of these nearly 6,500 languages that many linguists as they would begin to

519
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:49,079
Dive in and to begin looking at languages and historical aspects and the origins of language and all that sort of thing

520
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:56,159
They typically look back to three main root languages and again, I'm not a linguist

521
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,719
I'm not into the study of linguistics, but I did do some research to just get some of those those ideas of where

522
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,599
The the secular linguists look to and where they kind of track things back

523
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:15,000
Of course, they deny Babel as being the existence of the source of the confounding of languages

524
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,239
it is quite interesting how that their study though reveals the

525
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:25,039
accuracy of what we read in the scriptures of Genesis chapter 11 in fact an

526
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,839
evolutionary mind view comes up very sure on explaining the origin of languages and

527
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,279
They have a very difficult time being able to understand how

528
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,039
Languages developed over the time over the history so on and so forth

529
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,159
And so we find that God's plan was very simple and yet it was super effective

530
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,519
We find that as we notice in verse number eight, they're scattered

531
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,879
They were left off to build the city verse number nine. Therefore is the name of it called Babel

532
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,599
Because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad

533
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,639
upon the face of all the earth

534
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:10,339
Now the Hebrew word Babel carries with it the meaning of confusion or to confuse and we understand that based upon the languages

535
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:15,860
And the confusion of the languages the Babylonians prefer to use their meaning of the word

536
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:23,319
What is most acceptable to them and they define that it would mean the gate of God or the gate to God and that's very

537
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:28,299
Interesting is we're going to see the different worldviews in the different perspective and really a polytheistic

538
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:33,299
Perspective we begin to look at the Babylonians and all of their idols and what-have-you

539
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,860
Throughout the history and you begin to notice as we look at our passage of scripture this plan

540
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:45,979
that man had then they had this plan and they devised it and they had put it into motion and they were

541
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,619
moving forward and God comes and he simply

542
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,059
scatters them by

543
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,860
Changing confounding their language notice with me this thought

544
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,899
It really reminds us of how frail we really are

545
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,619
right

546
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:04,259
You know, one of the things has been interesting to me

547
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:12,860
During this pandemic that we've been dealing with over a number of months now is it reminds me of how frail

548
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,659
mankind is

549
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,459
It reminds me of how interconnected we are as a globe really a small world

550
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,139
with regard to all of the

551
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:30,500
Simple transmission from one continent to another but we understand the frailty of man and were reminded of the power of God

552
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,859
As we begin to think about this that happened at the Tower of Babel and how immediate it was

553
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:41,820
God just simply said I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna confound their languages BAM done

554
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,579
turn over to Revelation chapter 18 if you will I

555
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:51,279
Mentioned that we would make a few notes here of some things that are going on here in Revelation 17 and 18

556
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:54,979
We don't have time to have an in-depth study of these particular chapters

557
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,699
But we find that in chapter number 17

558
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:05,100
we would deal with really as we would describe it religious Babylon and really the the impact from a religious perspective and

559
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:12,139
The blasphemy that would come forth from Babylon and then you look at chapter 18 and commercial Babylon

560
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,779
And all that's taken place there

561
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,339
But I want you to look at something that is mentioned in Revelation 18 and verse number 10

562
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,859
The Bible says this standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas

563
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,519
the great city Babylon that mighty city

564
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:34,019
Notice this phrase for in one hour is thy judgment come

565
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,419
The Bible had said in verse number two and they cried

566
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:42,799
he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen and has become the

567
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:46,940
habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and

568
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,979
Hateful bird and so we find here that the Bible says here about in one hour is thy judgment come

569
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:57,419
Remember in Genesis chapter 11 the judgment came quick. It was swift

570
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:02,100
God just said here's what I'm gonna do. God's plan was simple. It was effective

571
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,260
notice with me even with the power that is seen in Revelation 17 and 18 of

572
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,419
religious and commercial Babylon in the system in which it

573
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:18,500
Represents you would find and be reminded if you turn back to Daniel chapter number five of the truth that this happened once before

574
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,699
in Daniel chapter number five

575
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,419
We are understanding of a great feast that takes place though

576
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:28,459
Shazar is the king if you look in Daniel 5 in verse number 1

577
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,260
The Bible says that Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords and drank wine before the thousand

578
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,299
There's this great feast that's going on

579
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,660
And we begin to and we don't have time to look at the entirety of Daniel chapter number five

580
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:43,260
But we really find that the Babylonians they had

581
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:51,619
Believed that they were a city that though they had been under siege that they would not be conquered because of the amount of

582
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,239
supply that they were able to have his

583
00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:02,779
historians tell us that many believe that they had nearly 20 years worth of supply for them to be able to live on and

584
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,619
The river Euphrates went right through the city. And so therefore they had water

585
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:12,820
They had some level of understanding of that that provision that would be there for them

586
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,260
And we find that the Bible tells us that as they're having this great feast

587
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,579
It says in verse number five in the same hour

588
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:26,059
Came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster the wall of the king's palace and the king

589
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:28,059
Saw the part of the hand that wrote

590
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,220
The Bible tells us the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him

591
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,899
So the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another they were here about that

592
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,459
You know that phraseology of your knees. You're so nervous. Your knees are knocking together

593
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:48,540
Well, there's Belshazzar as he sees this hand upon the wall writing if you fast-forward through the end

594
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,059
We don't have time to look at the all of it

595
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:56,179
But notice in verse number 30 in verse number 31 the Bible tells us in that night

596
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,059
was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain and

597
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,220
Darius the Median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old

598
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:13,459
What did they do? Well, they blocked up the Euphrates River and diverted it and they came through on the riverbed

599
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,299
Historically, that's what they did

600
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:21,660
You begin to think about the fact that these things that we read of in the scriptures when you read in

601
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,859
Revelation 17 and 18 you begin to see about in one hour

602
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:32,539
Thy judgment has come and you can sometimes say man. How is that gonna happen? Because God is so mighty and

603
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:35,099
man is so fragile and

604
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,659
here in Genesis chapter 11 that truth is revealed to us and

605
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:47,419
Reminded of though man would devise their plan that God has all power

606
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:54,539
One final passage that I want to share with you this evening before we close. It's in the book of Psalms in Psalm chapter number 2

607
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,539
Psalm chapter number 2

608
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:07,419
Remember this plan of these in Babel it was a plan that was void it was void of any

609
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,580
Inclusion of God they did not seek the face of God. They did not include God in their plans

610
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,179
In fact, they were in rebellion to God

611
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:18,739
We would say that as they sought to make a name for themselves and elevate man that it was a humanistic

612
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,500
Perspective and we find in Psalm chapter number 2 the Bible says why do the heathen rage?

613
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,739
And the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together

614
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,580
against the Lord and against his anointed saying

615
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:43,059
Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us. Notice this he that sitteth in the heavens

616
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,419
shall laugh

617
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,059
The Lord shall have them in derision

618
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,339
Inderision then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his

619
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,179
sore

620
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,179
displeasure

621
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:08,419
just a spoken word, the power of our God. We could continue looking and through

622
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:12,219
the passage and see some of that which is given, but we see that the

623
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:16,919
opposition to the Almighty God is really laughable. He that sitteth in the heaven

624
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:22,259
shall laugh and the Lord shall have them in derision. The very last revolt that we

625
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:27,579
read of in the Word of God is given to us at the end of chapter, really not the

626
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,179
very end, really the middle of chapter number 20 of the book of Revelation.

627
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:37,659
Remember during that period of time Satan is bound and then he'll be

628
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:40,739
bound during the millennial reign of Christ for that thousand years, but then

629
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,939
Satan is loosed for a little season. And as Satan is loosed for a little season, he

630
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:49,299
gathers up, there's this revolt against God. It's interesting as we would think

631
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:53,439
about the number of those that would revolt. The Bible says that their number

632
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,759
was as the sand of the sea, but God simply deals with this very quickly in

633
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,599
Revelation 20 and verse number 9. It says that they went up on the breadth of the

634
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,639
earth and compassed the camp of the saints about in the beloved city and

635
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:12,479
fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. Listen, God is never

636
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:17,279
going to be conquered. He's never going to be defeated. He is the Lord God

637
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:23,479
Almighty. He is King of kings, Lord of lords. Man, as we see even pre-flood, but

638
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:29,839
now as we look at post-flood, man in his plan has often sought under the

639
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:38,399
influence of satanic powers to make a plan void of God. Humanism. We see it in

640
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:46,319
Genesis chapter 11. We find that God very simply and quite effectively dealt with

641
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,439
the situation there at Babel, and he had them scattered. He confused their

642
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:57,359
languages. We find that as those family groups would leave, as we find that it's

643
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,199
recorded in Genesis chapter number 10, as that genealogy is provided that they

644
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:09,679
left and they were divided, that God was accomplishing his purpose. And again,

645
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,399
as we mentioned last week, as we begin to finish the 11th chapter, we won't deal

646
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:16,959
with it next week. Lord willing, we'll have our service outside next week. But

647
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,799
as we get back into Genesis on the following Sunday evening, we'll find that

648
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:29,159
at the end of chapter 11, God once again gives us the genealogy of the son of Noah,

649
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:35,000
Shem. We read part of that this evening, and takes us directly to Abraham. And

650
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,839
from there, throughout the remainder of scripture, we begin to see how that God

651
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,839
is dealing with the nation of Israel, with Abraham calling him out, the

652
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,279
Abrahamic Covenant, and all of those details that go forward. And you find

653
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:54,559
that scripture focuses in upon that line, which is the Messianic line. Of course, we

654
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,599
see, as one has said, it was, I believe, William Scroggie is the man that said

655
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,319
this, that the Bible, he referred to it as the unfolding drama of redemption. And

656
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,199
certainly that is the case. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

657
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,639
you for loving us. We thank you for the passage that is before us this evening,

658
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,079
for the opportunity that you've given us to study it and to see, really, the

659
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,359
historical account of what's taking place. But then even as we look at

660
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,359
scripture, compare scripture with scripture, we understand that this

661
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,479
account that is there in Genesis 11 is something that has been repeated

662
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:32,579
throughout the history of mankind, no doubt will be repeated again, even in the

663
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,879
last times, even during the tribulations we see in Revelation 17 and 18. And we

664
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:42,719
find that this thought of humanism, this practice of man seeking to make a

665
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,679
name for himself and living apart from God in resistance to God, Lord, that

666
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,199
that is a day and age in which we live. I pray that you would help us, as your

667
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,479
people, to be dependent upon thee. Help us to rely upon thee. Help us to understand

668
00:43:56,479 --> 00:44:00,659
the importance of walking with thee. And Lord, help us to be bold in taking a

669
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:06,759
message that is not always well received in this particular day and age, but help

670
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:11,519
us to take the message of the gospel to a lost and dying world, that people will

671
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,599
understand that one day they will stand before the Lord God Almighty, the Creator,

672
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,199
and we thank you that you are our Redeemer. We pray that you'd bless this

673
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,160
time of invitation. We'll thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in

674
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,479
Christ's name we pray. Amen. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are

675
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:30,679
closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. Maybe just want to thank God

676
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:35,399
for his plan and for the opportunity to be able to study his word and for the

677
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:39,320
privilege of being able to share the truth. As Kimberly plays, the altar is

678
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,839
open.
