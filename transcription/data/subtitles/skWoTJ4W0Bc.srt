1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Kings chapter number 7, and be looking at verses 1 and 2 for our lesson, our message

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,079
this evening.

3
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:11,439
And of course, we've been studying through the life of Elijah and now Elisha, and we've

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,199
been studying the life of Elisha for a number of weeks now.

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,079
As you may recall, in our previous study, as you look at the end of 2 Kings chapter

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,200
number 6, you find that the Syrians besieged Samaria.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,500
And the reality is, as you study the passage of Scripture, you would learn very quickly

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,540
that the situation in Samaria is terrible, and the Syrians, if we would say from a military

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,360
strategic perspective, they were successful in what they were attempting to do.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,580
They laid siege against the city, and they had a level of success in accomplishing what

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,659
they wanted to accomplish.

12
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:55,099
And the inhabitants of Samaria, as I mentioned last week, they were both hopeless and helpless.

13
00:00:55,099 --> 00:01:00,540
We remember how the Bible told us there in that passage of Scripture how there was no

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,699
food and how just the level of just terrible situation with the cannibalism, and the king

15
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:15,180
is informed of these things, and how sad to hear of what is going on.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,819
And the circumstances that are described here at the end of 2 Kings chapter number 6 are

17
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,459
really difficult, challenging for us to comprehend.

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,580
We find that the king was able to offer no success or no help through the situation.

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,940
He was at wit's end, so to speak.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,580
We find that he came to this conclusion, we should kill Elisha.

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,739
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but that was what he determined that he was going

22
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:47,500
to do, and he sent some people over to kill Elisha, and we find that Elisha was aware

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,260
of their coming and knew that their master, the king, would soon be behind.

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,900
When you end the sixth chapter of the book of 2 Kings by dealing with this really correspondence,

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,699
interaction if you will, between these individuals, and Elisha is there, and we enter into 2 Kings

26
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:11,039
chapter number 7, the passage in which we'll be studying this evening, notice the Bible

27
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,539
says in verse number 1,

28
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,940
Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord.

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,820
Thus saith the Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,059
a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

31
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:40,100
Then a lord, on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said, Behold,

32
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:47,580
if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

33
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:56,460
And he said, this is Elisha now, says, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,139
not eat thereof.

35
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:04,699
If you're in the habit of taking notes, the title for the message this evening, A Prophecy

36
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,259
of Provision.

37
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,059
A Prophecy of Provision.

38
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:12,899
As we mentioned, as you study the sixth chapter, you find that there is no provision, in fact,

39
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:20,500
the Bible tells us that the unclean animal that is mentioned there in verse number 25,

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,179
that the head of this animal was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, the fourth part

41
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:32,199
of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.

42
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,300
And you think about the destitute of the situation and really the desperation of the people as

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,899
they turn to cannibalism and all these terrible things that are going on, and now the man

44
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:47,500
of God stands and he delivers a prophecy of provision.

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,740
Now as we look at the passage of scripture, just a couple of verses, but I want you to

46
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,139
notice with me the confidence of the prophet.

47
00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:01,059
Oftentimes, as we've studied the life of Elijah and Elisha, we have noticed both the confidence

48
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,779
and the courage by which they serve the Lord.

49
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm thankful for those that serve God with courage.

50
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,059
I'm thankful for the message that was delivered to Joshua in Joshua chapter number one about

51
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:16,260
being courageous and having courage to stand for the Lord.

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,980
And we find that there are many characters, many Bible heroes, if we could use that terminology,

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,420
that had great courage in the face of adversity and opposition and difficulty.

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,140
They stood in courage to serve the Lord.

55
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,940
And here we see the confidence as we begin to study the prophecy that is given, a prophecy

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,540
of provision, I see that not only does Elisha have courage, but I see a measure of confidence

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,040
in what he says.

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,980
You know, as I look here at the passage, I'd like to see Elisha standing with a level of

59
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
boldness.

60
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,140
I preached a message on Sunday evening, how that we're to pray for boldness, a prayer

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:58,100
for boldness from Acts, and looking at those early disciples and early church leaders in

62
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,700
the book of Acts and how they prayed for boldness and they spake with boldness.

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,059
And here I envision Elisha standing, yes, in courage, but he stands to deliver a message

64
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,980
with confidence.

65
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,339
Notice he says, hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, very careful to make

66
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,799
known to those that he's speaking to that this message is not his message.

67
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:28,260
This is simply a message that he has been called to deliver.

68
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,339
And it is a message from the Lord himself.

69
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,000
Notice the content, if you will, of this prophecy as we speak about the confidence

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that he has.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,339
We'll look at the content in just a moment, but notice what he says as he's standing here.

72
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:48,260
He says, tomorrow, about this time, notice the word, shall a measure of fine flour be

73
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,380
sold for a shekel, two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.

74
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,540
And so we see that he stands with confidence and he says, hear ye the word of the Lord.

75
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,260
I have a message to deliver.

76
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,179
And he has confidence in what he's going to say.

77
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:06,859
You notice at the end of verse number two when he responds to that servant that made

78
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:11,820
that comment, he said, behold, thou shalt see it.

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,260
See, Elisha had confidence in the message that he was delivering.

80
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
He believed it.

81
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,700
Can I tell you this evening that when we speak the oracles of God, when we speak the word

82
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,100
of the Lord, that we can speak God's word with confidence.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,820
We can speak God's word with courage and we see the confidence of the prophet.

84
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,100
Notice the content of the prophecy.

85
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,179
As we look at verse number one, we find that the prophecy that is given is very specific.

86
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:44,339
What a blessing to see the specific nature of these prophecies and certainly you can

87
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,619
see that throughout the word of God.

88
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:51,140
And here, very specific, he deals with the when.

89
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,559
Notice he says tomorrow.

90
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,320
He does not just simply say at some point you're going to have food.

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,399
No, he says tomorrow.

92
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,600
And again, he stood with a level of confidence.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
But then as we begin to examine the content of the prophecy, we see the specific nature

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,079
of what he's going to say.

95
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,279
He says tomorrow about this time.

96
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,559
And notice he deals with the when, but then he deals with what.

97
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,720
What is it that's going to happen tomorrow about this time?

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,320
He says specifically that a measure of fine flour would be sold for a shekel.

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,000
A measure of fine flour for a shekel.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,119
Not only that, but two measures of barley for a shekel.

101
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,660
Now this is a very specific prophecy.

102
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,119
We see the content as we begin to dig in and we see that not only does he say when, but

103
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,119
he says what it is that is going to happen.

104
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,920
And then we see the where.

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,839
He says in the gate of Samaria.

106
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,559
This is a prophecy of provision.

107
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:58,480
The content of this prophecy is a powerful truth that is given.

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,279
Remember, if we would understand the timing in which this prophecy is given and understanding

109
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,440
the backdrop by which we've looked at in chapter number six and all of the challenges and difficulties

110
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,839
that are presenting themselves here in this particular time, and we find that these were

111
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,519
hungry people, these were people that were desperate.

112
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,959
And here comes the man of God, the prophet, delivering a prophecy of provision and he

113
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:31,399
says tomorrow, around this time, about this time, he says a measure of fine flour would

114
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,840
be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel.

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:46,599
Now I want you to remember that donkey's head was sold for four score pieces of silver.

116
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:53,119
And now the man of God is saying that there's a measure of fine flour for a shekel, two

117
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:58,640
measures of barley for a shekel.

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:07,200
This prophecy of provision was one that was hard to be understood given the current circumstances.

119
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,599
See what happens at times, and we'll see it as we get into the next verse of scripture,

120
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:16,359
what happens at times in our lives is we have a difficulty believing the word of God because

121
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:21,000
we're too focused upon our circumstances or our situation.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Begin to look at the circumstances by which we're living.

123
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,640
In fact, there are some that would say this when you would inquire, how are you, or how

124
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,280
are things going, and that sort of a normal greeting, well, under the circumstances, we've

125
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,039
all heard someone respond in that manner at some point in our lives.

126
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,440
The reality is that in times the circumstances can have so much of our attention, we can

127
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,960
be so focused on the things that we can see that it's hard for us to understand even what

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
God has told us.

129
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,080
And here, the prophet of God, Elisha, the man of God, he stands in confidence and he

130
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,919
delivers.

131
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,839
a specific message, we see the content of the prophecy.

132
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,919
Now, I want you to notice as we get into verse number two,

133
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,299
and really our third point,

134
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,259
the place in which we'll spend the remainder of our time this evening,

135
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,719
I want you to see the confusion.

136
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:17,679
I've called this man a servant, the confusion of the servant.

137
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,059
The Bible calls him, it says,

138
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,519
then a Lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God.

139
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,279
And so there was this servant of the king that was standing there,

140
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,239
that was listening,

141
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,859
and certainly there were a number of people that were gathered,

142
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,679
that heard this.

143
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,139
Remember, Elisha was a man that was giving the truth.

144
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,179
He was standing in courage and confidence,

145
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,439
and it was that group of people that had come to the place where he was

146
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,779
for the purpose of murdering him, of killing him.

147
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,859
And Elisha says,

148
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:48,859
Hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord.

149
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,739
He delivers this prophecy of provision,

150
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,959
and we find that this servant has a level of confusion,

151
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,199
and he questions the prophecy.

152
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,159
Notice what this one says.

153
00:10:59,179 --> 00:10:59,679
He says,

154
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:08,099
Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

155
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:14,979
Now I believe that as this servant, this individual responds to Elisha,

156
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:20,619
the content of his response reveals that he's really mocking Elisha.

157
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:25,079
He doesn't believe what Elisha said for one moment of time.

158
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,459
He says,

159
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,299
If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

160
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,999
Scoffing and mocking at the very prophecy that Elisha had just given,

161
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,839
a prophecy of provision.

162
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,019
And we find that this man offers this suggestion.

163
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,479
The thing that's interesting is in his mockery,

164
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,719
that we could see the statement that he makes,

165
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:48,779
the reality is that God could do that.

166
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,859
God could open windows in heaven.

167
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,239
I mean, for 40 years, He gave the children of Israel manna from heaven, right?

168
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:59,179
The Lord spoke of it during His earthly ministry as He's speaking.

169
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,019
You can read in John 6 and other portions,

170
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,479
where He speaks about manna that came from heaven,

171
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,779
and God miraculously, supernaturally gave the children of Israel manna from heaven

172
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,899
for those 40 years.

173
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,299
And here, this one that would mock,

174
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,739
He's looking at the circumstances.

175
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,479
He's perhaps trying to figure this thing out.

176
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,059
He says,

177
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,719
If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

178
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,099
See, I believe this evening is,

179
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,779
this is a place where we need to learn a valuable lesson.

180
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,899
Too often, I believe in my life and perhaps in your life as well,

181
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,139
we're more concerned with the how than the who.

182
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,939
See, we want to figure something out.

183
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,979
Perhaps we have that analytical type of a mind

184
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,979
and we want to be able to look at something

185
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,459
and it makes sense to us.

186
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,499
And we find that what Elisha says,

187
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,939
this measure of fine flour to be sold for a shekel

188
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,419
and two measures of barley for a shekel,

189
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,819
there's just absolutely no way, humanly speaking,

190
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,059
that this is possible.

191
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,299
And all I want to do is figure out how this is going to happen.

192
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,699
And we see this servant that is here that's listening

193
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,139
and this one that begins to, I believe, mock and scoff at Elisha.

194
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,379
He says, behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven,

195
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,899
might this thing be?

196
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,819
How's this going to happen, Elisha?

197
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:34,739
I believe that Elisha wasn't really too concerned with the how.

198
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,779
He just knew who.

199
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,859
He just knew that God said.

200
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,779
He just knew that he was delivering the Word of the Lord.

201
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,099
And he knew, remember, he prefaces what he says,

202
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:53,939
Hear ye the Word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord.

203
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,099
And here's what's going to happen.

204
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,379
Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour

205
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,299
be sold for a shekel,

206
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,779
two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.

207
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,899
But Elisha, don't you know that the Syrians are out there?

208
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,859
Elisha, don't you know that we have no food?

209
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,059
There's nothing.

210
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,779
Remember the king, he said when he was speaking

211
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,819
with those ladies at the end of chapter 6 and verse 27,

212
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,419
he said, if the Lord do not help thee, when shall I help thee?

213
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,379
Out of the barn floor, out of the wine press.

214
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,059
There was nothing.

215
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,259
They had no substance.

216
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,259
This siege that was laid against Samaria was successful.

217
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,419
Nothing in, nothing out.

218
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:40,019
And we find that what this prophecy contained

219
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,499
was not so much about the how it was going to happen,

220
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:46,739
but the who that was going to bring it to pass.

221
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,659
And we find that there's a valuable lesson

222
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,219
for us here this evening,

223
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,819
for there are times in our lives

224
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,379
where perhaps we read a portion of scripture,

225
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,339
we read some instruction from the Word of the Lord,

226
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,659
and we say, how is that going to work?

227
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,779
How is that going to happen?

228
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:03,899
How is that?

229
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:04,939
He's God.

230
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,459
Elisha didn't have to be concerned about the Syrians

231
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,459
that had surrounded the city.

232
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,459
Elisha didn't have to be concerned about the fact

233
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,779
that the storage facilities were empty,

234
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,379
that there was nothing.

235
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,659
All he had to be concerned about

236
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,579
was that the Lord God Almighty had given his word.

237
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:23,819
And God said, this is what's going to happen.

238
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,619
And God had commissioned Elisha to deliver this message.

239
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,139
And Elisha delivers the message.

240
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,619
As we look to the Word of God,

241
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:35,379
and we look to the circumstances perhaps in our own lives,

242
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,939
and we think about various things that we could look to,

243
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,859
and certainly the application would vary

244
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,339
from person to person, from family to family,

245
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,939
even region to region, as we would say,

246
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:48,499
that the Bible has so much contained therein,

247
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:49,899
and so many wonderful promises

248
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,099
that we go to the Word of God,

249
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,459
and maybe we're dealing with some particular struggle.

250
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,219
We say, how can this thing be?

251
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,699
Oh, we just need to trust God.

252
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,859
We don't always need an explanation of how.

253
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,019
We just need to believe God.

254
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,299
See, the Bible teaches us that just shall live by faith.

255
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,939
The Bible teaches us that faith is the important aspect

256
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,219
for every child of God.

257
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,139
In fact, it will be teaching

258
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,499
through the book of Hebrews this year.

259
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,899
And obviously, we've there in the sixth chapter

260
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:19,979
this past Sunday morning.

261
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,659
Eventually, we'll get to chapter number 11.

262
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,539
And we find that chapter number 11 of Hebrews,

263
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,059
often referred to as the Hall of Faith chapter,

264
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,179
says in verse number one,

265
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,379
now faith is the substance of things hoped

266
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:35,859
for the evidence of things not seen.

267
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,259
We find that the Bible tells us

268
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:39,899
in verse number six of Hebrews 11,

269
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,659
but without faith, it is impossible to believe Him,

270
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,019
for He that cometh to God, or excuse me, to please Him,

271
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,539
for He that cometh to God must believe that He is,

272
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,579
and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

273
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,459
And so if I wanna please God, I gotta live by faith.

274
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:57,459
It is impossible to please Him without faith,

275
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,019
according to Hebrews 11 and verse number six.

276
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,859
And so as we begin to look at this truth,

277
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,859
this prophecy of provision there

278
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,899
in 2 Kings chapter number seven,

279
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:10,059
and we understand the circumstances

280
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,299
in which the children of Israel are living,

281
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,659
and we understand that they've been besieged by the Syrians,

282
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,359
and they have nothing, and they've turned,

283
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,739
at least a number of them, to this thing of cannibalism,

284
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,659
and it's a terrible scene that has been set for us,

285
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,879
and now the man of God delivers this prophecy of provision.

286
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,179
How's it gonna happen?

287
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,499
You know, so often we ask the question, how?

288
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,539
And really just need to be concerned with who.

289
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,219
What did God say?

290
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:44,259
Has God ever failed?

291
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,539
No.

292
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,459
He's never failed you, and He's not gonna start.

293
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,379
Our God is able.

294
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:55,459
Our God has proven Himself over and over and over

295
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,059
throughout the Word of God.

296
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,059
As we could look at example after example,

297
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,939
I think of the disciples, and I know we often use

298
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:04,939
the example of the feeding of the 5,000,

299
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:06,519
but I want you to consider the miracle

300
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,099
for just a moment this evening,

301
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,459
and I want you to consider, as they're there,

302
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,739
and they have just a few pieces of provision,

303
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:15,239
I mean, just a few loaves and a couple of fish,

304
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,119
and you find that they're there,

305
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,779
and they have all of these people,

306
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,739
and they have the idea, like, let's send them away.

307
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,259
I mean, the day is far spent.

308
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,979
I mean, we don't have enough.

309
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:31,579
And Jesus tells them to give them to eat.

310
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,899
How are we gonna do it?

311
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,820
200 penny worth is not enough

312
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,500
that each would just have a little, right?

313
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,639
I mean, that's, how?

314
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:41,599
How are we gonna do it?

315
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,339
Jesus said, put them in companies of 50,

316
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,419
and let's give them to eat.

317
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,260
How?

318
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,500
No, no, who?

319
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,339
Jesus said it was gonna happen.

320
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,260
He's God.

321
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,260
You don't have to worry about how it's gonna happen,

322
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,519
because He, God, said it would.

323
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,419
And if you read through the passage of Scripture,

324
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,339
the Bible tells us that Jesus prayed,

325
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,599
and He break that bread,

326
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,299
and it's an amazing truth to me,

327
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,619
and I hope that it just would capture our mind this evening

328
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,039
the way that those disciples would go,

329
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,059
and they would distribute,

330
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,599
and they would come back to Jesus,

331
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,179
and get more substance to go to deliver to another group,

332
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,459
and He'd go, and they would distribute that substance,

333
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,820
and they would come back to Jesus,

334
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,619
and every time they came back,

335
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,339
they found that there was more to be delivered.

336
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,779
Why?

337
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:30,779
Because He's God.

338
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:32,599
Because He's God.

339
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,599
And it's interesting that in our lives,

340
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,019
as much as we know about God,

341
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,859
I mean, we have the complete canon of Scripture.

342
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,919
We can read account after account after account.

343
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
In fact, most of us, many of us,

344
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,359
could stand up and speak about some of the great stories,

345
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,239
quote unquote, accounts of the Bible.

346
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:59,559
We could speak about the great victories that God wrought.

347
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,559
and we could speak about the provision and the protection,

348
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,279
and we could speak about David and Goliath,

349
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,939
and David and a number of events in his life,

350
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,019
and we could speak about Daniel,

351
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,659
and I mean, so many.

352
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:13,959
Gideon and Joshua.

353
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,459
We're studying through the book of Joshua

354
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,579
even now during this time.

355
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,019
And we could look at so many examples.

356
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,599
But at times in our own lives,

357
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,459
when the circumstances seem to be overwhelming

358
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,139
and they have our attention,

359
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,859
we say, how?

360
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,619
How's this gonna happen?

361
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,839
How's this gonna work?

362
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,899
How's this gonna come to pass?

363
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,939
All the while, forgetting to take into consideration

364
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:46,259
that God said it.

365
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,579
And if God said it, that settles it.

366
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,359
Bumper stickers used to exist,

367
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,659
and I'm not sure, I have not seen

368
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,059
this particular bumper sticker in quite a while,

369
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,619
but I remember seeing it years ago.

370
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,459
God said it, I believe it, that settles it.

371
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,299
And I've often said, whether you believe it or not

372
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,220
doesn't have any part of the equation.

373
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,379
God said it, and that settles it.

374
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:14,019
And it's a good thing if you believe what God said,

375
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,579
but whether you believe or do not believe,

376
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,860
it doesn't change what God said,

377
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,819
and what God said settles the matter.

378
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:26,699
God said, through the prophet Elisha,

379
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,579
that this provision would be made available.

380
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,939
He told him when, he told him what,

381
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,500
and he told him where.

382
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,139
I noticed that at the end of verse number two,

383
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,180
as we find that Elisha then responds,

384
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,899
and it seems to me quite obvious

385
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,879
that in the response of Elisha,

386
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,659
we understand that this servant came

387
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,699
with a level of mockery and being a scoffer

388
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,939
when he says, behold, if the Lord would make windows

389
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:53,899
in heaven, might this thing be?

390
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,019
He's doubting.

391
00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:00,299
The Bible says that he said, Elisha said,

392
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,819
behold thou, speaking of this servant

393
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,779
described as a lord on whose hand the king leaned,

394
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,779
the Bible says that thou shalt see it with thine eyes.

395
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,720
But notice, but shalt not eat thereof.

396
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,619
Really, the interesting aspect

397
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,419
of the last part of verse number two

398
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,619
is that this also is prophetic.

399
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:28,419
And we see that it comes to pass exactly

400
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:31,699
as the man of God said in verse number 17.

401
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:34,860
It says that he died as the man of God said

402
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,660
who spake when the king came down to him

403
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,059
at the end of verse number 17.

404
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,459
And he saw that what the man of God said

405
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,179
was going to happen came to pass.

406
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,619
But he did not partake of it.

407
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,259
He did not eat thereof.

408
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,259
And I hope this evening that we would be people of faith.

409
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,699
That we just believe God.

410
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,459
That we would have that measure of faith

411
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,559
as Paul did in Acts 27.

412
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,779
That we'd stand up and say, I believe God.

413
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,300
It's an interesting passage there in Acts 27.

414
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
They're dealing with a terrible storm.

415
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,979
You're a Clyden in verse number 14 of Acts 27.

416
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,539
The Bible tells us that they were tempest and tossed.

417
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,899
And I mean, it was an exceeding strong storm.

418
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,259
And they were wishing for the day.

419
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,759
I mean, it was just a bad situation.

420
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:33,899
But then here we have where it tells us

421
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:36,979
that they could not bear up.

422
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,899
I mean, the ship was caught in the wind.

423
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:40,940
It was being driven.

424
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,360
It tells us in Acts 27 at the end of verse number 20,

425
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,979
when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared

426
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,940
and no small tempest lay on us,

427
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,360
all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

428
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:57,220
That's a dire circumstance.

429
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,459
Acts 27 in verse number 20.

430
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:03,699
All hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

431
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:08,699
And then Paul comes and he says in verse number 22,

432
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,300
I exhort you to be of good cheer.

433
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,040
For there shall be no loss of any man's life among you,

434
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,339
but of the ship.

435
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,339
For there stood by me this night the angel of God,

436
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,660
whose I am and whom I serve saying,

437
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,660
fear not Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar

438
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,660
and lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

439
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:36,100
Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer.

440
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,339
For I believe, God,

441
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,980
that it shall be even as it was told me.

442
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,040
How are we gonna escape this storm?

443
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,799
We haven't seen the sun or the moon or the stars in days.

444
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,619
There's no hope that we should be saved.

445
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,119
And Paul stands up and says, be of good cheer.

446
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,079
Not the right message for the moment.

447
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,399
Oh, it was absolutely the message that they needed.

448
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,160
Because Paul was delivering a message with confidence.

449
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,600
He says that there's not gonna be any loss of any lives.

450
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,679
And then he tells them, I believe God.

451
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,119
How's God gonna do it?

452
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
I don't know.

453
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,559
He's the master of the sea.

454
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,600
He's the one that can,

455
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,919
now we know, because we can read all of Acts 27

456
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,160
and we can see historically what God did.

457
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,399
In fact, in 2 Kings 7,

458
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:30,220
because we're on this side of the history book,

459
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,320
we can read the entirety of the text

460
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,119
and we know how God did it.

461
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,559
But at that very moment,

462
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,880
they didn't need to know how,

463
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,239
they didn't need to concern themselves with how,

464
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,359
they just needed to believe that God said it.

465
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,480
In my life, in your life,

466
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,160
I don't know what's on the morrow,

467
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,359
but I know who holds tomorrow.

468
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,839
I don't know all that's gonna come to pass.

469
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,679
I don't know how it's all gonna work out.

470
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,160
But I know that my God is on His throne.

471
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,279
And I know that He's given me

472
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,559
exceeding great and precious promises.

473
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,440
And though at times it might seem a level of confusion

474
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,079
in my life or in your life,

475
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,720
oh, how we come to that place that Paul came to

476
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,119
and said, I just believe God.

477
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,440
I just believe God.

478
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,440
Elisha stands up and says, hear the word of the Lord.

479
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,839
Thus saith the Lord.

480
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,559
Tomorrow, about this time,

481
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,959
He gives them this prophecy.

482
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,720
We see His confidence.

483
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,600
We've read the content.

484
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,959
There's a level of confusion

485
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,239
on the part of this servant of the King.

486
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm so glad that we serve a God of the impossible.

487
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
The circumstances can be as bleak as ever,

488
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,079
but God's still on the throne.

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,839
And He will not be defeated.

490
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,639
He is King of kings and Lord of lords,

491
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,399
the Lord God omnipotent.

492
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,200
And He has a plan and His plan will come to pass.

493
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,799
I believe God.

494
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,239
We look at this prophecy of provision

495
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:04,079
and we know that there's a great lesson for us

496
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,079
in understanding not to be so concerned with the how,

497
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,919
as much as we are with the who.

498
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,040
If God said it, that settles it.

499
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,399
Let's believe God.

500
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,200
Father, we love You.

501
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,559
We thank You for loving us.

502
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,119
We thank You for Thy word.

503
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
The accounts of history that are recorded for us,

504
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,519
not only so that we could have an understanding

505
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,079
of these historical events,

506
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,119
but God, so that we could be challenged

507
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,559
in our own walk with Thee.

508
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,839
That we could be helped.

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,720
Lord, many times throughout the Scriptures,

510
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,119
we can see where there are people

511
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,839
that were too concerned with the how

512
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,919
and not as focused on the who.

513
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,119
I'm thankful that David knew that You, God,

514
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,079
would deliver him from Goliath.

515
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, Saul and others wanted to know how.

516
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,919
David just believed You.

517
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,359
We could see example after example.

518
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,279
God, I pray that in our lives today

519
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,279
that You would help us to have faith,

520
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,639
to walk by faith, to live by faith, to believe You.

521
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,600
We thank You that You're the God of the impossible,

522
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,320
that there's nothing too difficult for Thee,

523
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,799
that You indeed are able to do exceeding,

524
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,279
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

525
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,799
Lord, we pray that You would bless

526
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,400
our time of prayer this evening.

527
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
Thank You for the privilege.

528
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,159
As those that are gathered here would pray

529
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,080
and seek Your face,

530
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,640
I pray that those that are watching the live stream

531
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,039
would spend time together in prayer,

532
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,239
seeking Your face, seeing, God, what You're able to do.

533
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,840
We thank You for the privilege.

534
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,760
We thank You for Your work in our lives.

535
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,640
We thank You for the privilege.

536
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,039
We thank You for Your work in our lives,

537
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,119
and we pray that we would live in such a way

538
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,440
that You alone would be glorified.

539
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,039
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
