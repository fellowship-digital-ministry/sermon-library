WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Kings chapter number 7, and be looking at verses 1 and 2 for our lesson, our message

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.079
this evening.

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:11.439
And of course, we've been studying through the life of Elijah and now Elisha, and we've

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.199
been studying the life of Elisha for a number of weeks now.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.079
As you may recall, in our previous study, as you look at the end of 2 Kings chapter

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:24.200
number 6, you find that the Syrians besieged Samaria.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.500
And the reality is, as you study the passage of Scripture, you would learn very quickly

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.540
that the situation in Samaria is terrible, and the Syrians, if we would say from a military

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.360
strategic perspective, they were successful in what they were attempting to do.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.580
They laid siege against the city, and they had a level of success in accomplishing what

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.659
they wanted to accomplish.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.099
And the inhabitants of Samaria, as I mentioned last week, they were both hopeless and helpless.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:01:00.540
We remember how the Bible told us there in that passage of Scripture how there was no

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.699
food and how just the level of just terrible situation with the cannibalism, and the king

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:15.180
is informed of these things, and how sad to hear of what is going on.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.819
And the circumstances that are described here at the end of 2 Kings chapter number 6 are

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.459
really difficult, challenging for us to comprehend.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.580
We find that the king was able to offer no success or no help through the situation.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.940
He was at wit's end, so to speak.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.580
We find that he came to this conclusion, we should kill Elisha.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.739
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but that was what he determined that he was going

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:47.500
to do, and he sent some people over to kill Elisha, and we find that Elisha was aware

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.260
of their coming and knew that their master, the king, would soon be behind.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.900
When you end the sixth chapter of the book of 2 Kings by dealing with this really correspondence,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.699
interaction if you will, between these individuals, and Elisha is there, and we enter into 2 Kings

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:11.039
chapter number 7, the passage in which we'll be studying this evening, notice the Bible

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.539
says in verse number 1,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:18.940
Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.820
Thus saith the Lord, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.059
a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:40.100
Then a lord, on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said, Behold,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.580
if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:56.460
And he said, this is Elisha now, says, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.139
not eat thereof.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:04.699
If you're in the habit of taking notes, the title for the message this evening, A Prophecy

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.259
of Provision.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.059
A Prophecy of Provision.

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.899
As we mentioned, as you study the sixth chapter, you find that there is no provision, in fact,

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:20.500
the Bible tells us that the unclean animal that is mentioned there in verse number 25,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.179
that the head of this animal was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, the fourth part

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:32.199
of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.300
And you think about the destitute of the situation and really the desperation of the people as

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.899
they turn to cannibalism and all these terrible things that are going on, and now the man

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:47.500
of God stands and he delivers a prophecy of provision.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.740
Now as we look at the passage of scripture, just a couple of verses, but I want you to

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.139
notice with me the confidence of the prophet.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:01.059
Oftentimes, as we've studied the life of Elijah and Elisha, we have noticed both the confidence

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.779
and the courage by which they serve the Lord.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.460
I'm thankful for those that serve God with courage.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.059
I'm thankful for the message that was delivered to Joshua in Joshua chapter number one about

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:16.260
being courageous and having courage to stand for the Lord.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.980
And we find that there are many characters, many Bible heroes, if we could use that terminology,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.420
that had great courage in the face of adversity and opposition and difficulty.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.140
They stood in courage to serve the Lord.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.940
And here we see the confidence as we begin to study the prophecy that is given, a prophecy

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.540
of provision, I see that not only does Elisha have courage, but I see a measure of confidence

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.040
in what he says.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.980
You know, as I look here at the passage, I'd like to see Elisha standing with a level of

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.980
boldness.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.140
I preached a message on Sunday evening, how that we're to pray for boldness, a prayer

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.100
for boldness from Acts, and looking at those early disciples and early church leaders in

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.700
the book of Acts and how they prayed for boldness and they spake with boldness.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.059
And here I envision Elisha standing, yes, in courage, but he stands to deliver a message

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.980
with confidence.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:20.339
Notice he says, hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, very careful to make

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.799
known to those that he's speaking to that this message is not his message.

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:28.260
This is simply a message that he has been called to deliver.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.339
And it is a message from the Lord himself.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.000
Notice the content, if you will, of this prophecy as we speak about the confidence

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that he has.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.339
We'll look at the content in just a moment, but notice what he says as he's standing here.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:48.260
He says, tomorrow, about this time, notice the word, shall a measure of fine flour be

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.380
sold for a shekel, two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.540
And so we see that he stands with confidence and he says, hear ye the word of the Lord.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.260
I have a message to deliver.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.179
And he has confidence in what he's going to say.

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.859
You notice at the end of verse number two when he responds to that servant that made

00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:11.820
that comment, he said, behold, thou shalt see it.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.260
See, Elisha had confidence in the message that he was delivering.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260
He believed it.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.700
Can I tell you this evening that when we speak the oracles of God, when we speak the word

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.100
of the Lord, that we can speak God's word with confidence.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.820
We can speak God's word with courage and we see the confidence of the prophet.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.100
Notice the content of the prophecy.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.179
As we look at verse number one, we find that the prophecy that is given is very specific.

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:44.339
What a blessing to see the specific nature of these prophecies and certainly you can

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.619
see that throughout the word of God.

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:51.140
And here, very specific, he deals with the when.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.559
Notice he says tomorrow.

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.320
He does not just simply say at some point you're going to have food.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.399
No, he says tomorrow.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.600
And again, he stood with a level of confidence.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
But then as we begin to examine the content of the prophecy, we see the specific nature

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.079
of what he's going to say.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.279
He says tomorrow about this time.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.559
And notice he deals with the when, but then he deals with what.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.720
What is it that's going to happen tomorrow about this time?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.320
He says specifically that a measure of fine flour would be sold for a shekel.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.000
A measure of fine flour for a shekel.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.119
Not only that, but two measures of barley for a shekel.

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:36.660
Now this is a very specific prophecy.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.119
We see the content as we begin to dig in and we see that not only does he say when, but

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:44.119
he says what it is that is going to happen.

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:45.920
And then we see the where.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.839
He says in the gate of Samaria.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.559
This is a prophecy of provision.

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:58.480
The content of this prophecy is a powerful truth that is given.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.279
Remember, if we would understand the timing in which this prophecy is given and understanding

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:08.440
the backdrop by which we've looked at in chapter number six and all of the challenges and difficulties

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.839
that are presenting themselves here in this particular time, and we find that these were

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:18.519
hungry people, these were people that were desperate.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:23.959
And here comes the man of God, the prophet, delivering a prophecy of provision and he

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:31.399
says tomorrow, around this time, about this time, he says a measure of fine flour would

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:35.840
be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:46.599
Now I want you to remember that donkey's head was sold for four score pieces of silver.

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:53.119
And now the man of God is saying that there's a measure of fine flour for a shekel, two

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:58.640
measures of barley for a shekel.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:07.200
This prophecy of provision was one that was hard to be understood given the current circumstances.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.599
See what happens at times, and we'll see it as we get into the next verse of scripture,

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:16.359
what happens at times in our lives is we have a difficulty believing the word of God because

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:21.000
we're too focused upon our circumstances or our situation.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.200
Begin to look at the circumstances by which we're living.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.640
In fact, there are some that would say this when you would inquire, how are you, or how

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.280
are things going, and that sort of a normal greeting, well, under the circumstances, we've

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.039
all heard someone respond in that manner at some point in our lives.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:44.440
The reality is that in times the circumstances can have so much of our attention, we can

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.960
be so focused on the things that we can see that it's hard for us to understand even what

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.440
God has told us.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.080
And here, the prophet of God, Elisha, the man of God, he stands in confidence and he

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.919
delivers.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.839
a specific message, we see the content of the prophecy.

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:06.919
Now, I want you to notice as we get into verse number two,

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.299
and really our third point,

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:11.259
the place in which we'll spend the remainder of our time this evening,

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.719
I want you to see the confusion.

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:17.679
I've called this man a servant, the confusion of the servant.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.059
The Bible calls him, it says,

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:23.519
then a Lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:26.279
And so there was this servant of the king that was standing there,

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.239
that was listening,

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:29.859
and certainly there were a number of people that were gathered,

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.679
that heard this.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:35.139
Remember, Elisha was a man that was giving the truth.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:37.179
He was standing in courage and confidence,

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:41.439
and it was that group of people that had come to the place where he was

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:44.779
for the purpose of murdering him, of killing him.

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:45.859
And Elisha says,

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:48.859
Hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord.

00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:51.739
He delivers this prophecy of provision,

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:54.959
and we find that this servant has a level of confusion,

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.199
and he questions the prophecy.

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:59.159
Notice what this one says.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:10:59.679
He says,

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:08.099
Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:14.979
Now I believe that as this servant, this individual responds to Elisha,

00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:20.619
the content of his response reveals that he's really mocking Elisha.

00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:25.079
He doesn't believe what Elisha said for one moment of time.

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:26.459
He says,

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:30.299
If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:34.999
Scoffing and mocking at the very prophecy that Elisha had just given,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:36.839
a prophecy of provision.

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:40.019
And we find that this man offers this suggestion.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.479
The thing that's interesting is in his mockery,

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:45.719
that we could see the statement that he makes,

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:48.779
the reality is that God could do that.

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:50.859
God could open windows in heaven.

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:55.239
I mean, for 40 years, He gave the children of Israel manna from heaven, right?

00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:59.179
The Lord spoke of it during His earthly ministry as He's speaking.

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:02.019
You can read in John 6 and other portions,

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.479
where He speaks about manna that came from heaven,

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:10.779
and God miraculously, supernaturally gave the children of Israel manna from heaven

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:13.899
for those 40 years.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.299
And here, this one that would mock,

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.739
He's looking at the circumstances.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:23.479
He's perhaps trying to figure this thing out.

00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:24.059
He says,

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.719
If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:30.099
See, I believe this evening is,

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:33.779
this is a place where we need to learn a valuable lesson.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:37.899
Too often, I believe in my life and perhaps in your life as well,

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:42.139
we're more concerned with the how than the who.

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:43.939
See, we want to figure something out.

00:12:43.939 --> 00:12:46.979
Perhaps we have that analytical type of a mind

00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:48.979
and we want to be able to look at something

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.459
and it makes sense to us.

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:54.499
And we find that what Elisha says,

00:12:54.499 --> 00:12:56.939
this measure of fine flour to be sold for a shekel

00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:59.419
and two measures of barley for a shekel,

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:02.819
there's just absolutely no way, humanly speaking,

00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:05.059
that this is possible.

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:09.299
And all I want to do is figure out how this is going to happen.

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:12.699
And we see this servant that is here that's listening

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:17.139
and this one that begins to, I believe, mock and scoff at Elisha.

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:20.379
He says, behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven,

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.899
might this thing be?

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:27.819
How's this going to happen, Elisha?

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:34.739
I believe that Elisha wasn't really too concerned with the how.

00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:36.779
He just knew who.

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:38.859
He just knew that God said.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:42.779
He just knew that he was delivering the Word of the Lord.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:46.099
And he knew, remember, he prefaces what he says,

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:53.939
Hear ye the Word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.099
And here's what's going to happen.

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:57.379
Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.299
be sold for a shekel,

00:13:59.299 --> 00:14:02.779
two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:07.899
But Elisha, don't you know that the Syrians are out there?

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:10.859
Elisha, don't you know that we have no food?

00:14:10.859 --> 00:14:12.059
There's nothing.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.779
Remember the king, he said when he was speaking

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:17.819
with those ladies at the end of chapter 6 and verse 27,

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:20.419
he said, if the Lord do not help thee, when shall I help thee?

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:22.379
Out of the barn floor, out of the wine press.

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:24.059
There was nothing.

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:27.259
They had no substance.

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:31.259
This siege that was laid against Samaria was successful.

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:34.419
Nothing in, nothing out.

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:40.019
And we find that what this prophecy contained

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:43.499
was not so much about the how it was going to happen,

00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:46.739
but the who that was going to bring it to pass.

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:49.659
And we find that there's a valuable lesson

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.219
for us here this evening,

00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:52.819
for there are times in our lives

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:55.379
where perhaps we read a portion of scripture,

00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:58.339
we read some instruction from the Word of the Lord,

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:00.659
and we say, how is that going to work?

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:02.779
How is that going to happen?

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:03.899
How is that?

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:04.939
He's God.

00:15:06.219 --> 00:15:08.459
Elisha didn't have to be concerned about the Syrians

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:10.459
that had surrounded the city.

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:12.459
Elisha didn't have to be concerned about the fact

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:14.779
that the storage facilities were empty,

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:16.379
that there was nothing.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:17.659
All he had to be concerned about

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:21.579
was that the Lord God Almighty had given his word.

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:23.819
And God said, this is what's going to happen.

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:27.619
And God had commissioned Elisha to deliver this message.

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:30.139
And Elisha delivers the message.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:31.619
As we look to the Word of God,

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:35.379
and we look to the circumstances perhaps in our own lives,

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:37.939
and we think about various things that we could look to,

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:39.859
and certainly the application would vary

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.339
from person to person, from family to family,

00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:44.939
even region to region, as we would say,

00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:48.499
that the Bible has so much contained therein,

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:49.899
and so many wonderful promises

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:51.099
that we go to the Word of God,

00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:53.459
and maybe we're dealing with some particular struggle.

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.219
We say, how can this thing be?

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:57.699
Oh, we just need to trust God.

00:15:57.699 --> 00:16:00.859
We don't always need an explanation of how.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.019
We just need to believe God.

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:07.299
See, the Bible teaches us that just shall live by faith.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.939
The Bible teaches us that faith is the important aspect

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:12.219
for every child of God.

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:14.139
In fact, it will be teaching

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.499
through the book of Hebrews this year.

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:18.899
And obviously, we've there in the sixth chapter

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:19.979
this past Sunday morning.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.659
Eventually, we'll get to chapter number 11.

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:25.539
And we find that chapter number 11 of Hebrews,

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:28.059
often referred to as the Hall of Faith chapter,

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:29.179
says in verse number one,

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:32.379
now faith is the substance of things hoped

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:35.859
for the evidence of things not seen.

00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:38.259
We find that the Bible tells us

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:39.899
in verse number six of Hebrews 11,

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:43.659
but without faith, it is impossible to believe Him,

00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:46.019
for He that cometh to God, or excuse me, to please Him,

00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:48.539
for He that cometh to God must believe that He is,

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:51.579
and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.459
And so if I wanna please God, I gotta live by faith.

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:57.459
It is impossible to please Him without faith,

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:00.019
according to Hebrews 11 and verse number six.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.859
And so as we begin to look at this truth,

00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:05.859
this prophecy of provision there

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.899
in 2 Kings chapter number seven,

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:10.059
and we understand the circumstances

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:12.299
in which the children of Israel are living,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:15.659
and we understand that they've been besieged by the Syrians,

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:18.359
and they have nothing, and they've turned,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.739
at least a number of them, to this thing of cannibalism,

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:25.659
and it's a terrible scene that has been set for us,

00:17:25.659 --> 00:17:29.879
and now the man of God delivers this prophecy of provision.

00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:31.179
How's it gonna happen?

00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:35.499
You know, so often we ask the question, how?

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:40.539
And really just need to be concerned with who.

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:42.219
What did God say?

00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:44.259
Has God ever failed?

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:45.539
No.

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:48.459
He's never failed you, and He's not gonna start.

00:17:49.379 --> 00:17:51.379
Our God is able.

00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:55.459
Our God has proven Himself over and over and over

00:17:55.459 --> 00:17:57.059
throughout the Word of God.

00:17:57.059 --> 00:18:00.059
As we could look at example after example,

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:02.939
I think of the disciples, and I know we often use

00:18:02.939 --> 00:18:04.939
the example of the feeding of the 5,000,

00:18:04.939 --> 00:18:06.519
but I want you to consider the miracle

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.099
for just a moment this evening,

00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:10.459
and I want you to consider, as they're there,

00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:12.739
and they have just a few pieces of provision,

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:15.239
I mean, just a few loaves and a couple of fish,

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.119
and you find that they're there,

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.779
and they have all of these people,

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:22.739
and they have the idea, like, let's send them away.

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:24.259
I mean, the day is far spent.

00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:25.979
I mean, we don't have enough.

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:31.579
And Jesus tells them to give them to eat.

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:32.899
How are we gonna do it?

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:36.820
200 penny worth is not enough

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.500
that each would just have a little, right?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.639
I mean, that's, how?

00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:41.599
How are we gonna do it?

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:45.339
Jesus said, put them in companies of 50,

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:47.419
and let's give them to eat.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.260
How?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.500
No, no, who?

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.339
Jesus said it was gonna happen.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:52.260
He's God.

00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:56.260
You don't have to worry about how it's gonna happen,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.519
because He, God, said it would.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.419
And if you read through the passage of Scripture,

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:03.339
the Bible tells us that Jesus prayed,

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:04.599
and He break that bread,

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:06.299
and it's an amazing truth to me,

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:09.619
and I hope that it just would capture our mind this evening

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:12.039
the way that those disciples would go,

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:13.059
and they would distribute,

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:14.599
and they would come back to Jesus,

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:18.179
and get more substance to go to deliver to another group,

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:21.459
and He'd go, and they would distribute that substance,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.820
and they would come back to Jesus,

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.619
and every time they came back,

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:27.339
they found that there was more to be delivered.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.779
Why?

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:30.779
Because He's God.

00:19:31.659 --> 00:19:32.599
Because He's God.

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:37.599
And it's interesting that in our lives,

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.019
as much as we know about God,

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:41.859
I mean, we have the complete canon of Scripture.

00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:45.919
We can read account after account after account.

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:48.880
In fact, most of us, many of us,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.359
could stand up and speak about some of the great stories,

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:56.239
quote unquote, accounts of the Bible.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:59.559
We could speak about the great victories that God wrought.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:02.559
and we could speak about the provision and the protection,

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.279
and we could speak about David and Goliath,

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:08.939
and David and a number of events in his life,

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:11.019
and we could speak about Daniel,

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:12.659
and I mean, so many.

00:20:12.659 --> 00:20:13.959
Gideon and Joshua.

00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:15.459
We're studying through the book of Joshua

00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:17.579
even now during this time.

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:22.019
And we could look at so many examples.

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:24.599
But at times in our own lives,

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.459
when the circumstances seem to be overwhelming

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:30.139
and they have our attention,

00:20:30.139 --> 00:20:32.859
we say, how?

00:20:32.859 --> 00:20:34.619
How's this gonna happen?

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.839
How's this gonna work?

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:38.899
How's this gonna come to pass?

00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:43.939
All the while, forgetting to take into consideration

00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:46.259
that God said it.

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:49.579
And if God said it, that settles it.

00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:51.359
Bumper stickers used to exist,

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.659
and I'm not sure, I have not seen

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:57.059
this particular bumper sticker in quite a while,

00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:59.619
but I remember seeing it years ago.

00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:02.459
God said it, I believe it, that settles it.

00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:05.299
And I've often said, whether you believe it or not

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:08.220
doesn't have any part of the equation.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.379
God said it, and that settles it.

00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:14.019
And it's a good thing if you believe what God said,

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:16.579
but whether you believe or do not believe,

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:18.860
it doesn't change what God said,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.819
and what God said settles the matter.

00:21:22.819 --> 00:21:26.699
God said, through the prophet Elisha,

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:29.579
that this provision would be made available.

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.939
He told him when, he told him what,

00:21:31.939 --> 00:21:33.500
and he told him where.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.139
I noticed that at the end of verse number two,

00:21:37.139 --> 00:21:39.180
as we find that Elisha then responds,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.899
and it seems to me quite obvious

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.879
that in the response of Elisha,

00:21:42.879 --> 00:21:45.659
we understand that this servant came

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:49.699
with a level of mockery and being a scoffer

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:51.939
when he says, behold, if the Lord would make windows

00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:53.899
in heaven, might this thing be?

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:55.019
He's doubting.

00:21:57.379 --> 00:22:00.299
The Bible says that he said, Elisha said,

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:03.819
behold thou, speaking of this servant

00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:06.779
described as a lord on whose hand the king leaned,

00:22:06.779 --> 00:22:11.779
the Bible says that thou shalt see it with thine eyes.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.720
But notice, but shalt not eat thereof.

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:19.619
Really, the interesting aspect

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:21.419
of the last part of verse number two

00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:23.619
is that this also is prophetic.

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:28.419
And we see that it comes to pass exactly

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:31.699
as the man of God said in verse number 17.

00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:34.860
It says that he died as the man of God said

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.660
who spake when the king came down to him

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.059
at the end of verse number 17.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:43.459
And he saw that what the man of God said

00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:46.179
was going to happen came to pass.

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:47.619
But he did not partake of it.

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:50.259
He did not eat thereof.

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:54.259
And I hope this evening that we would be people of faith.

00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:55.699
That we just believe God.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.459
That we would have that measure of faith

00:22:59.459 --> 00:23:01.559
as Paul did in Acts 27.

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:05.779
That we'd stand up and say, I believe God.

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:08.300
It's an interesting passage there in Acts 27.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.300
They're dealing with a terrible storm.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.979
You're a Clyden in verse number 14 of Acts 27.

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:19.539
The Bible tells us that they were tempest and tossed.

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:22.899
And I mean, it was an exceeding strong storm.

00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:25.259
And they were wishing for the day.

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:27.759
I mean, it was just a bad situation.

00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:33.899
But then here we have where it tells us

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:36.979
that they could not bear up.

00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:38.899
I mean, the ship was caught in the wind.

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:40.940
It was being driven.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:45.360
It tells us in Acts 27 at the end of verse number 20,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.979
when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared

00:23:47.979 --> 00:23:49.940
and no small tempest lay on us,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.360
all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:57.220
That's a dire circumstance.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.459
Acts 27 in verse number 20.

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:03.699
All hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

00:24:03.699 --> 00:24:08.699
And then Paul comes and he says in verse number 22,

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:12.300
I exhort you to be of good cheer.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.040
For there shall be no loss of any man's life among you,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.339
but of the ship.

00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:20.339
For there stood by me this night the angel of God,

00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:22.660
whose I am and whom I serve saying,

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.660
fear not Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.660
and lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:36.100
Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.339
For I believe, God,

00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:44.980
that it shall be even as it was told me.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.040
How are we gonna escape this storm?

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.799
We haven't seen the sun or the moon or the stars in days.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:53.619
There's no hope that we should be saved.

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:56.119
And Paul stands up and says, be of good cheer.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.079
Not the right message for the moment.

00:24:59.079 --> 00:25:02.399
Oh, it was absolutely the message that they needed.

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:06.160
Because Paul was delivering a message with confidence.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.600
He says that there's not gonna be any loss of any lives.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.679
And then he tells them, I believe God.

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.119
How's God gonna do it?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
I don't know.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.559
He's the master of the sea.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.600
He's the one that can,

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.919
now we know, because we can read all of Acts 27

00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:25.160
and we can see historically what God did.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.399
In fact, in 2 Kings 7,

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:30.220
because we're on this side of the history book,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.320
we can read the entirety of the text

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.119
and we know how God did it.

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.559
But at that very moment,

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:37.880
they didn't need to know how,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.239
they didn't need to concern themselves with how,

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:43.359
they just needed to believe that God said it.

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:46.480
In my life, in your life,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.160
I don't know what's on the morrow,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.359
but I know who holds tomorrow.

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:52.839
I don't know all that's gonna come to pass.

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:55.679
I don't know how it's all gonna work out.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:25:59.160
But I know that my God is on His throne.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.279
And I know that He's given me

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:04.559
exceeding great and precious promises.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:09.440
And though at times it might seem a level of confusion

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.079
in my life or in your life,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.720
oh, how we come to that place that Paul came to

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.119
and said, I just believe God.

00:26:16.119 --> 00:26:17.440
I just believe God.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.440
Elisha stands up and says, hear the word of the Lord.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.839
Thus saith the Lord.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.559
Tomorrow, about this time,

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:27.959
He gives them this prophecy.

00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:29.720
We see His confidence.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.600
We've read the content.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.959
There's a level of confusion

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:36.239
on the part of this servant of the King.

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:40.000
I'm so glad that we serve a God of the impossible.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.600
The circumstances can be as bleak as ever,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.079
but God's still on the throne.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.839
And He will not be defeated.

00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:50.639
He is King of kings and Lord of lords,

00:26:50.639 --> 00:26:52.399
the Lord God omnipotent.

00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:56.200
And He has a plan and His plan will come to pass.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.799
I believe God.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.239
We look at this prophecy of provision

00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:04.079
and we know that there's a great lesson for us

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:09.079
in understanding not to be so concerned with the how,

00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:11.919
as much as we are with the who.

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:15.040
If God said it, that settles it.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.399
Let's believe God.

00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:18.200
Father, we love You.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.559
We thank You for loving us.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.119
We thank You for Thy word.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.880
The accounts of history that are recorded for us,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.519
not only so that we could have an understanding

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:34.079
of these historical events,

00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:36.119
but God, so that we could be challenged

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.559
in our own walk with Thee.

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:39.839
That we could be helped.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.720
Lord, many times throughout the Scriptures,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.119
we can see where there are people

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:49.839
that were too concerned with the how

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.919
and not as focused on the who.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.119
I'm thankful that David knew that You, God,

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:01.079
would deliver him from Goliath.

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:05.000
Oh, Saul and others wanted to know how.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.919
David just believed You.

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:11.359
We could see example after example.

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:14.279
God, I pray that in our lives today

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:18.279
that You would help us to have faith,

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:22.639
to walk by faith, to live by faith, to believe You.

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:26.600
We thank You that You're the God of the impossible,

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.320
that there's nothing too difficult for Thee,

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.799
that You indeed are able to do exceeding,

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:34.279
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:36.799
Lord, we pray that You would bless

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.400
our time of prayer this evening.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.840
Thank You for the privilege.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.159
As those that are gathered here would pray

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:44.080
and seek Your face,

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.640
I pray that those that are watching the live stream

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.039
would spend time together in prayer,

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:53.239
seeking Your face, seeing, God, what You're able to do.

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:55.840
We thank You for the privilege.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.760
We thank You for Your work in our lives.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:59.640
We thank You for the privilege.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.039
We thank You for Your work in our lives,

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:04.119
and we pray that we would live in such a way

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:06.440
that You alone would be glorified.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.039
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
