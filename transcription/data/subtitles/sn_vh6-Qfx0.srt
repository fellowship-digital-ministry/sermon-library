1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Kings chapter number seven, second Kings chapter number seven.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,300
As you're turning there, I want to remind you of the words

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,500
that we just sang from verse number four and oh, for a thousand tongues to sing.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,760
Verse number four says this.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,340
He breaks the power of canceled sin.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,260
He sets the prisoner free.

7
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:23,760
Aren't you thankful for the freedom that we have from the penalty of sin?

8
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:25,940
Oh, hallelujah.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,860
His blood can make the phallus clean.

10
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,880
His blood availed for me.

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,380
Well, praise the Lord for the blood of Christ.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,840
And I'm so thankful that God has given us his word

13
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:44,020
and that in his word, he's revealed to us the plan of salvation.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,860
Second Kings chapter number seven.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,740
And I'll be looking at the entire chapter here this evening and 20 verses.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,319
The circumstances surrounding the event that are recorded here

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,500
in second Kings chapter number seven are quite awful.

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,000
And I want to back up into the sixth chapter

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,959
by way of introduction this evening and just paint a picture

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,599
to help us see the circumstances, the setting, what's going on in Israel

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,559
at the time of this particular event that is recorded in second

22
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,099
Kings chapter number seven.

23
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:20,319
Notice with me in chapter chapter number six in verse number 24.

24
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,739
The Bible says this, and it came to pass after this

25
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:28,099
that Ben Hadad, king of Syria, gathered all his hosts

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,779
and went up and besieged Samaria.

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,440
So that really, in verse number 24, begins providing for us

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,980
the setting of this particular event that we're going to study

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,540
in the seventh chapter this evening, or at least an aspect of this particular event.

30
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:50,500
And we see that the Bible tells us that the Syrians had besieged Samaria,

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,059
the capital there of Israel, the northern kingdom.

32
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,599
We find that it then tells us this to further give us insight

33
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,239
as to the circumstances that they're facing in verse number 25.

34
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,599
It says, and there was a great famine in Samaria.

35
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,699
This is the result typically of a city under siege.

36
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,699
We would find that now there's this great famine that's in Samaria.

37
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,619
And the Bible tells us, and behold, they besieged it until an ass's head

38
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:21,179
was sold for four score pieces of silver

39
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:27,720
and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver.

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,639
I don't need to take the time this evening to explain all that's there

41
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,639
in verse number 25, but you understand that these are awful circumstances

42
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,679
and there's nothing to eat.

43
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,220
It's a bad situation.

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,220
And we find that they had been they are under siege.

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,800
There's a great famine.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,360
And then in verse number 29, the Bible tells us that there's even

47
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,440
the act of cannibalism that's taking place.

48
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,979
Notice in verse number 29, the Bible said, well, look at back up in verse 27.

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,899
And he said, if the Lord do not help thee, this is the king of Israel

50
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,940
speaking to this woman that's crying.

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,320
He says, whence shall I help thee out of the barn floor, out of the wine press?

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,619
The king said unto her, what aileth thee?

53
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,160
And she answered, this woman said unto me,

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,839
give thy son that we may eat him today

55
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,800
and we will eat my son tomorrow.

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,360
That's crazy.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,320
I mean, absolutely crazy.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,360
Right. Verse 29.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,119
So we boiled my son and did eat him.

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,740
And I said unto her on the next day, give thy son that we may eat him.

61
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,500
And she hath hid her son.

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,220
That's unbelievable to me.

63
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,500
To think about circumstances being so grave, so awful

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,220
that it would come to this place, I can't even imagine.

65
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,220
But that's what the Bible tells us is going on.

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,520
That's what's going on in Israel at this particular time.

67
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,360
When this event, when we're going to read, and of course, the king

68
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:55,940
is going to try to put blame on Elisha, which makes zero sense whatsoever.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,699
And we find that we come to the beginning of the seventh chapter

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,020
and we find that second Kings chapter number seven begins

71
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,860
with a powerful proclamation from the prophet of God, Elisha.

72
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,960
Notice what Elisha says in verse number one.

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,660
Then Elisha said, hear ye the word of the Lord.

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,820
Aren't you thankful that God gave a word

75
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,119
and what a blessing to think about the faithfulness of Elisha

76
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,160
to proclaim that word?

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,200
And he says this thus saith the Lord.

78
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,119
Tomorrow, about this time, shall a measure of fine

79
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:31,119
flour be sold for a shackle and two measures of barley

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,000
for a shackle in the gate of Samaria.

81
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,640
Now, this proclamation from Elisha is really as you look at the context

82
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,000
and look at what's going on in chapter number six.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,380
It's unbelievable.

84
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,079
And we find that there's a an individual, a Lord, as he's referred to

85
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,260
in verse number two, that that absolutely has no idea

86
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,380
how this could ever come to pass.

87
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,299
And we find that given the circumstances in chapter number six,

88
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,679
it helps us to understand why this man would respond

89
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,679
to the proclamation that Elisha makes in verse number one.

90
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,100
Notice what he says in verse number two, then a Lord on whose hand

91
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,480
the king lean answered the man of God and said, behold,

92
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,279
if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

93
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,859
And he said, that's Elisha, then said to this man

94
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:17,980
that made this statement, behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,

95
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,059
but shalt not eat thereof.

96
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,859
If you look at the end of chapter number seven,

97
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,859
you will find that the passage of scripture concludes

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,519
with the fulfillment of the prophecy that's given in verse number one.

99
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,519
I could spend the entire evening tonight focused upon this prophecy

100
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,399
and its fulfillment that is recorded here in second Kings chapter number seven

101
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,600
for us, and certainly a powerful truth that God gives.

102
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,640
Given the dire circumstances that Israel was facing,

103
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,059
the Syrians laying siege against the city, the great famine,

104
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:57,059
the terrible lengths in which they were going through.

105
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:00,600
And we find that Elisha then stands up to a people that were needy,

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,640
to a people that were hurting, to a people that were overwhelmed.

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,339
And he says, here's what God says.

108
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,100
But in the midst of this biblical account,

109
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,519
we're introduced to four leprous men.

110
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,899
And I want to spend our time this evening focusing our attention

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,019
upon these four leprous men.

112
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,220
We are introduced to them in verse number three,

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,640
and we see that over the next several verses of scripture

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,179
that God gives us some wonderful truth with regard to these men.

115
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,600
And we'll make some spiritual application this evening.

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,100
I want to read verse number nine, and then we'll get right into the message.

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,019
Notice in verse number nine, the Bible says this.

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,519
Then they, that's the four leprous men, then they said one to another, we do not well.

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,440
This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.

120
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,559
If we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us.

121
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,779
Now, therefore, come that we may go and tell the king's household.

122
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,320
I've talked to the message this evening, as you see there in the bulletin

123
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,559
from verse number nine, hold our peace or go and tell.

124
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,899
Hold our peace or go and tell.

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,980
Notice with me as we focus our attention upon these four leprous men.

126
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:24,600
Notice with me what they receive.

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Number one, if you're taking notes, what they receive.

128
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,859
The Bible introduces these men to us in verse number three.

129
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,179
Notice the Bible says this.

130
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,440
And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate,

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,359
and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die?

132
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:40,980
And so we begin to see in verse three and four that their logic is revealed

133
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,480
to us regarding the circumstances in which they're facing.

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,940
They're out there at the gate.

135
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,140
The Bible says that they, as they're speaking one to another,

136
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,140
they say, why sit we here until we die?

137
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,399
I mean, they're just waiting to die.

138
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,399
That's a terrible situation.

139
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,519
We find that they give as the logic is explained to us in verse number four.

140
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,480
Notice what they say.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,100
If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,980
and we shall die there.

143
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,019
Well, that's not a good option.

144
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:12,100
Notice they say this, and if we sit still here, we die also.

145
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,519
So so we got no good option.

146
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,200
So here's what they say.

147
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,160
Now, therefore, come and let us fall under the host of the Syrians.

148
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,420
If they save us alive, we shall live.

149
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,500
And if they kill us, we shall but die.

150
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:31,739
The only option that they saw that had any glimmer of hope was to go to the Syrians

151
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,119
because they said, if we stay here, we're going to die.

152
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,239
If we go into the city, there's famine there.

153
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,119
There's no hope of living.

154
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,900
And if we go to the Syrians, the fact of the matter is that they may kill us as well.

155
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,320
But they may save us alive.

156
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,739
So the only option that they really could have under the circumstances

157
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,700
they're facing as their logic is revealed to us was that they would go to the Syrians.

158
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,979
And so the Bible tells us in verse number five that they rose up in the twilight

159
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,400
to go into the camp of the Syrians.

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,780
Now, when you're sanctified imagination,

161
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,239
I hope that you can see this in your mind's eye tonight.

162
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,359
As you think about these four leprous men, they're having this conversation.

163
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,280
All of the circumstances, the the dire circumstances,

164
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,619
the awful conditions that are taking place in Israel and Samaria

165
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:19,200
at this particular time and in the twilight, these four men,

166
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,320
they rise up and they go into the camp of the Syrians.

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
But the Bible says in verse number five, when they were come

168
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,900
to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, notice what it says.

169
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,619
There was no man there.

170
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,080
Now, that's not what they expected, is it?

171
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,359
Is that what you would expect?

172
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,900
I mean, the Syrians had laid siege against the city.

173
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,479
The city was in a great famine.

174
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,859
No doubt there was opportunity for them to have seen the Syrians

175
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:47,700
on the horizon and all that was taking place.

176
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,979
But on this particular night, as they have this logic, this reason

177
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:54,059
that takes place and they they enter and they or they depart

178
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,440
and they enter into the outer part of the camp.

179
00:09:56,599 --> 00:10:00,020
And the Bible says that they found no man there.

180
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
there.

181
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Why?

182
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
What happened?

183
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
Well, verse number six.

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,820
Notice what God did.

185
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,060
By the way, this is fulfillment of the prophecy that Elisha gave in verse number one as to

186
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,960
how God would bring this to pass.

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,700
But we see in verse number six that he says this, "...for the Lord had made the host

188
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,460
of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, even the noise of a

189
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,520
great host."

190
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,860
God made them hear something.

191
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,560
Isn't that awesome?

192
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,320
And notice what they say.

193
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,300
It says, "...and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against

194
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,720
us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us."

195
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,380
And so they immediately come to this conclusion, these Syrians, they reach the conclusion as

196
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,540
God caused them to hear this noise, they reach this conclusion that the king of Israel has

197
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,960
hired the Hittites and the Egyptians to come upon them.

198
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Why?

199
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,980
Well, because the Israelites weren't able to battle the Syrians.

200
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,720
They obviously are in a dire circumstance.

201
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,960
And so the Syrians have this belief.

202
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
So what do they do?

203
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,640
Well, the Bible tells us in verse number seven, "...wherefore they arose and fled in the

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:17,040
twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was,

205
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,320
and fled for their life."

206
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,360
That must have been some noise that God made them hear, right?

207
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
I mean, God was working miraculously.

208
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,300
He was bringing to pass that which was mentioned in verse number one, that, "...tomorrow about

209
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,420
this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley

210
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,540
for a shekel in the gate of Samaria."

211
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:49,340
If you do a study between 2 Kings 7-1 and 2 Kings 6-25, it will absolutely amaze you

212
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,220
the difference in a day, because God did something amazing.

213
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,040
The Bible tells us, again, as we're considering what they receive, notice with me in the detail

214
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,800
that's given in verse number eight, "...and when these lepers came to the uttermost part

215
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,360
of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver

216
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,480
and gold and raiment, and went and hid it, and came again and entered into another tent,

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,420
and carried thence also, and went and hid it."

218
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,520
So we see that they receive sustenance.

219
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,220
The Bible speaks about the fact that they did eat and drink.

220
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,420
By the way, they had not eaten.

221
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,020
There was famine in the land, and we find that they're eating and drinking, not only

222
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,420
that they receive sustenance, but they receive substance, for the Bible says that they had

223
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,100
silver and gold and raiment.

224
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,580
What did they do with it?

225
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,940
Well, they went and hid it.

226
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
They went and hid it.

227
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,700
And they went into another tent, and they entered into that one, and, man, they found

228
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,820
more silver and gold and raiment.

229
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
By the way, there's only...

230
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,680
Even if you're in the midst of a famine, if you've not eaten for days, there's only so

231
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,000
much food you can eat.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,840
I mean, you can only consume so much and make yourself sick, especially if you've not eaten

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,240
much for a period of time.

234
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,080
That's why it's so careful if you're fasting and you're coming off of a fast, how that

235
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,820
you introduce your body to food slowly, and so on and so forth.

236
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,080
And we find here that they receive...

237
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
They find great spoil.

238
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,540
I mean, they were blessed, and they had said to themselves, listen, if we sit here, we're

239
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,820
going to die.

240
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,740
If we go to the city, we're going to die.

241
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,620
If we go to the Syrians, they may kill us, but they might save us alive.

242
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,780
And then they get there, and there's no one, just empty tents with all of the goods left.

243
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,140
Isn't that amazing?

244
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,260
They eat and they drink.

245
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,300
They gather.

246
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,500
They hide.

247
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,680
They go to the next.

248
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,660
I want you to see in verse number 9 how we quickly transition from what they received

249
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,820
to what they recognized.

250
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:02,260
Evidently, as we read verse number 9, there was some level of conviction by their conduct.

251
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:08,060
The Bible says in verse number 9, then they said one to another, we do not well.

252
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,820
Isn't that an interesting statement?

253
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,180
These four leprous men, as they're finding this great spoil, as they're going from tent

254
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,800
to tent, and there's no man that's found there, and they have the opportunity to eat and to

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,440
get gold and silver and raiment, and they're hiding those things.

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,520
And they then come to this place where they say, we do not well.

257
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,000
We do not well.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240
Why do they say that?

259
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,400
Notice what they say.

260
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,660
This day is a day of good tidings.

261
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:47,520
They recognize that this day was a day of good tidings, but not just for them.

262
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,920
This day of good tidings was not just for the four leprous men.

263
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,480
God had caused, now, they don't know at this particular time that it was God that caused

264
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
this noise.

265
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm sure they don't understand all of why they found an empty camp and so on and so

266
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,520
forth, but we find that they recognize that this was a day of good tidings, and notice

267
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,880
what they say, and we hold our peace.

268
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
You know what they're saying?

269
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,020
This day of good tidings, this, what we have found now, the sustenance and the substance,

270
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,680
this isn't just for us.

271
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,400
This is for the people back in Samaria.

272
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,980
And we're holding our peace, therefore, we do not well.

273
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,280
Notice what they think.

274
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,680
It tells us here in verse number nine that they say, if we tarry till the morning light,

275
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,880
some mischief will come upon us, now therefore come.

276
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,760
So they were concerned, again, I mentioned that they must have been convicted by their

277
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,840
behavior, and they're thinking, man, if we don't tell them, if we just keep trying to

278
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,200
gather all this for ourselves and keep trying to hide these things, something bad's going

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,160
to happen.

280
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
We do not well.

281
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,640
So what do they say?

282
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,860
Now therefore come.

283
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,880
Notice the end of verse number nine, that we may go and tell the king's household.

284
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,700
That we may go and tell.

285
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,560
No longer holding our peace, but going and telling.

286
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,200
I want you to notice with me in verse number nine that no one instructed them to do this.

287
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,460
No one told these four men, hey, go and tell the people in Samaria what you found.

288
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,960
No one tells them that.

289
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
No.

290
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,280
What they recognized is that what they had received was not just for them.

291
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,260
They recognized that what they had received was for the people of Israel.

292
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,660
And we notice that as we look in this passage of Scripture and we see what they received

293
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,220
and then what they recognized, I want you to note with me as we continue in the passage

294
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,260
how they responded.

295
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,960
The Bible tells us in verse number 10 how they responded.

296
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,940
See the reality is that they could have said, hey, listen, we do not well.

297
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,060
It's a day of good tidings.

298
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
We hold our peace.

299
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,440
And, you know, we probably should go tell someone.

300
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,760
And then just relax.

301
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,120
Not do anything.

302
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,080
No.

303
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,180
What they recognized impacted how they responded.

304
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,760
And I want you to notice the phrase in verse number 10, it says, so they came and called

305
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:36,360
unto the porter of the city, and they told them, saying, here's the message.

306
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,760
I want you to think about this as you think about what's happened.

307
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,020
Remember, it tells us that they rose up in the twilight in verse number 5, and they find

308
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,520
what they find that we've just recorded with regard to the camp of the Syrians.

309
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
And so they come and they call for the porter of the city, and they told them, and they

310
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,900
give this update, they give this report.

311
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,940
They came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no man there, neither voice

312
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,620
of man, but horses tied and asses tied in the tents as they were.

313
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,860
Can you imagine the message?

314
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,740
I want you to think about the person receiving the message.

315
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,220
Really?

316
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,660
Did the Syrians put you up to this?

317
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
That's what they could be thinking.

318
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,180
It says in verse number 11, he called the porters, and they told it to the king's house

319
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,860
within.

320
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,980
Notice the king's response.

321
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,660
The king arose in the night and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the

322
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,200
Syrians have done to us.

323
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,739
This is what the king thought.

324
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,780
This reveals to us the doubt that this man had.

325
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,960
It says, they know that we be hungry, therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves

326
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,980
in the field, saying, when they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get

327
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
into the city.

328
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,540
That's what the king thinks.

329
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,400
It's a setup, basically.

330
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
If you were to summarize verse 12 very, very briefly, you'd say it's a setup.

331
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,679
That's what the king believed.

332
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,480
He hears the report that these four leprous men brought, and he says, no, no, no, this

333
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,800
is a setup.

334
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,040
They know that we're hungry.

335
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,200
They know that they have been successful in laying the siege against the city, and they

336
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,880
are in this place, and they've just gone, and they've hid themselves, and when we come,

337
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,640
they're going to take advantage.

338
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,040
They're going to catch us alive and get into the city.

339
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Notice what one of the servants says in verse number 13.

340
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,160
He answered and said, let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain.

341
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,440
Now think about that.

342
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Five of the horses that remain.

343
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,559
It was a terrible situation in Israel.

344
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,880
It says this, which are left in the city, behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel

345
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,520
that are left in it, behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites

346
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
that are consumed, and let us send and see.

347
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,440
These four leprous men said that they needed to go and tell, and now these servants to

348
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,880
the king say, let us send and see.

349
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,960
Let us find out if this is legitimate.

350
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,080
Let us find out what's going on here.

351
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
and so what do they do?

352
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,260
They took therefore two chariot horses,

353
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,000
and the king sent after the host of the Syrians,

354
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
saying, go and see.

355
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,460
And they went after them unto Jordan,

356
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,460
and lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels,

357
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,640
which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.

358
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,020
And the messengers returned and told the king,

359
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,640
and the people went out and spoiled

360
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,600
the tents of the Syrians.

361
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,900
Here's the fulfillment, verse 16.

362
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,280
So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel,

363
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,820
and two measures of barley for a shekel,

364
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,500
according to the word of the Lord.

365
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,020
God always does what he says he will do.

366
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,420
He gave Elisha that prophecy to proclaim in verse number one,

367
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,460
and we find that these men,

368
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,660
as we consider how they responded, they took action.

369
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,100
They took action.

370
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,380
See, they didn't just talk about it.

371
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,340
They didn't just talk about, you know,

372
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,260
it's probably not a good thing that we just hold our peace.

373
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,820
We probably should go tell somebody

374
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,680
and just kind of have a discussion.

375
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,940
No, no, they did it.

376
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,160
They took action.

377
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
They went into the city.

378
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,960
They proclaimed the good news.

379
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,820
Notice I said this is a day of good tidings.

380
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't you think the people there in the city

381
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,040
would have need of these things

382
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,280
that we have come into contact with,

383
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
the sustenance and the substance?

384
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,360
And we see that they proclaimed this good news.

385
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,080
What a great response, by the way.

386
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,340
So they had freely received.

387
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
God had worked miraculously,

388
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,880
but they recognized we do not well.

389
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,560
We do not well, why?

390
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,020
For we hold our peace.

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,360
It's a day of good tidings,

392
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,980
and we need to go and tell the king's household.

393
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,860
As you continue looking through this passage,

394
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,320
we'll finish the historical aspect

395
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,520
and then make an application this evening.

396
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,000
The Bible tells us in verse number 17,

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,200
and the king appointed the Lord on whose hand he leaned

398
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,480
to have the charge of the gate.

399
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,260
Now, that's the same guy in verse number two

400
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,420
that said when Elisha made the proclamation,

401
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,660
he said, if the Lord would make windows in heaven,

402
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,980
might this thing be?

403
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,740
And here's what Elisha said.

404
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,140
Thou shalt see it with thine eyes,

405
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,580
but shall not eat thereof.

406
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,900
It's a very specific statement that Elisha makes.

407
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,520
And so this man, the same man from verse number two,

408
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,700
according to verse number 17,

409
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,620
is assigned to take charge of the gate.

410
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,740
And we find that it says,

411
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,360
and the people trod upon him in the gate,

412
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
and he died, as the man of God had said,

413
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,440
who spake when the king came down to him.

414
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,720
And it came to pass,

415
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,280
as the man of God had spoken to the king,

416
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,000
saying, two measures of barley for a shekel

417
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,800
and a measure of fine flour for a shekel

418
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,080
shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria,

419
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,400
and that the Lord answered the man of God and said,

420
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,360
now, behold, if the Lord shall make windows in heaven,

421
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,320
might such a thing be?

422
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,800
And he said, behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,

423
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,900
but shalt not eat thereof.

424
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
And so it fell out unto him,

425
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,120
for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.

426
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,200
And that's the historical context of this particular event.

427
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,640
What a great proclamation, a prophecy in verse number one,

428
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,960
and then the fulfillment of that prophecy.

429
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,280
But right in the midst of this passage of Scripture,

430
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,840
God gives us the account of these four leprous men.

431
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,160
It's very interesting as you study the chapter,

432
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,480
and we've reviewed it this evening,

433
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,100
but it's very interesting as you begin

434
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,760
to look at this chapter and to begin

435
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,480
to see all that's taking place,

436
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,820
how that God, in his infinite wisdom,

437
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,160
we know that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

438
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,800
We know that he said that it's profitable for us,

439
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,760
that he inserts for us, he desires for us to have on record

440
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,340
this account of these four leprous men and what happened.

441
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,120
The reality is that the prophecy that's given

442
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,960
in verses one and two, we could just skip down

443
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,520
and begin reading in verse number 16

444
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,980
and see the fulfillment of the prophecy

445
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,020
and just skip the middle part.

446
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,300
But God said, no, I want you to have the middle part.

447
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,860
I want you to understand what happened.

448
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
I want you to think about these four leprous men.

449
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,620
And this evening, as we make a spiritual application

450
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,380
from this Old Testament passage of Scripture,

451
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,540
I wanna think of ourselves as these four leprous men.

452
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,800
Not that we're lepers,

453
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,340
but in that we've received something.

454
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,120
See, they were in need.

455
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
They were gonna die.

456
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,620
They say, if we stay here, we're gonna die.

457
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,340
If we go in there, we're gonna die.

458
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,340
If we go to the Syrians, we may die, but we may live.

459
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,920
And they go out and they find that there's no man there.

460
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,940
Sustenance, food, and drink.

461
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,060
Substance, silver, gold, and raiment.

462
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,940
They received it.

463
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,740
This evening, we've received the gift of God,

464
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,860
which is eternal life.

465
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,580
Can I say to you this evening that we don't deserve it?

466
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,480
Those four leprous men,

467
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,380
they didn't deserve what they received.

468
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,940
We don't deserve eternal life.

469
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,420
None of us do.

470
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,940
None of us are worthy of it.

471
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,140
We all fall short, for there's none righteous, no, not one.

472
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,880
Isn't that what the Bible says?

473
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,280
Romans chapter number three?

474
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,600
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

475
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,940
We don't deserve heaven.

476
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,020
We don't deserve the gift of God, which is eternal life.

477
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,420
You read Romans six and verse number 23,

478
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,880
for the wages of sin is death.

479
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
That's what we deserve.

480
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,580
But the gift of God is eternal life

481
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,800
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

482
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,500
I'm so thankful for that gift of God.

483
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,620
I'm thankful for eternal life, and I've received it.

484
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,140
And when I begin to think about what I've received

485
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,760
being this gift of life, I also recognize this evening,

486
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,700
just as these men recognize these four leprous men,

487
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,080
they received this sustenance and the substance,

488
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,720
and we, this evening, we've received eternal life.

489
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,120
If you've been saved tonight, if you've been born again,

490
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,840
then you have eternal life.

491
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,280
But what we recognize, just as those men recognize,

492
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
we do not.

493
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,940
Well, why?

494
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,380
For today is a day of good tidings.

495
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,840
We hold our peace.

496
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,540
I want you to think about what we recognize.

497
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,420
We recognize that He, the Lord Jesus Christ alone,

498
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,620
is the Savior.

499
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,940
He's the only Savior.

500
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,360
There's no other name by which mankind can be saved.

501
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,180
Amen?

502
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,260
There's no other name but the name of Jesus.

503
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,420
We find that we understand this evening

504
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,740
that salvation is in no other name.

505
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,420
We find that the Bible teaches us,

506
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,540
as Paul would make this declaration,

507
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,400
that he says this, it's a faithful saying

508
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,720
and worthy of all acceptation,

509
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,000
that Christ Jesus came into the world

510
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,960
for what purpose?

511
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
To save sinners,

512
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,700
of whom I am chief.

513
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,840
In 1 Timothy 1 and verse number 15.

514
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,120
I would say this in Hebrews chapter number seven,

515
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,680
that the Bible tells us in verse number 25

516
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,560
that our God is able to save.

517
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,200
We recognize this truth.

518
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,160
It says in verse number 25 of Hebrews 7,

519
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,460
wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost

520
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,660
that come unto God by Him,

521
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,220
seeing that He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

522
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,300
Think about this truth that we recognize.

523
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
The Bible says in 2 Peter 3 and verse number nine,

524
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
the Lord is not slack concerning His promise,

525
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,860
as some men count slackness.

526
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,780
But as longsuffering to us were to not willing

527
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,660
that any should perish,

528
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,660
but that all should come to repentance.

529
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,740
You know, God desires for people to be saved.

530
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,080
He desires for people to be saved.

531
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,600
We find that we recognize these truths this evening,

532
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,560
and as we recognize these truths,

533
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,240
just as these men had recognized

534
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,600
that it was a day of good tidings, of glad tidings,

535
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,440
and yet they held their peace,

536
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,280
and they had to respond to what they had recognized,

537
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,960
we recognize that we've received the gift of God,

538
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

539
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,220
We recognize this evening that Jesus said,

540
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,860
I, singularly, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

541
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,780
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

542
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,340
We understand that He came into the world to save sinners.

543
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,580
We understand that He desires for all men to be saved,

544
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,780
according to 1 Timothy 2 and verse number four.

545
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,100
How do we respond to what we recognize?

546
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,280
How do we respond?

547
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:39,179
See, these four leprous men,

548
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,340
they responded by saying, we need to go and tell.

549
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,500
We can't hold our peace.

550
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,340
We need to go and tell.

551
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,119
So they rose up and they went, and they proclaimed.

552
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,940
I think about the recipients of that message,

553
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,739
even as we noted the king, it's a setup.

554
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,420
You know, sometimes people don't believe us.

555
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,720
Sometimes people don't recognize

556
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,020
that they need what we're trying to give them.

557
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,679
It happens.

558
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,820
Sometimes it happens more often

559
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,420
than we'd like for it to happen.

560
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,580
But as I think about the passage of Scripture there

561
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,619
in 2 Kings chapter number seven,

562
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,600
and I think about the behavior

563
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,540
before we get to verse number nine,

564
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,640
when they say we do not well,

565
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,500
and I want you to think about what they were doing.

566
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,820
As they were going from one tent to another,

567
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,420
what were they doing with the goods?

568
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,540
They were hiding them.

569
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,860
They were hiding them.

570
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,720
Turn to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

571
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,559
if you will.

572
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,400
2 Corinthians chapter number four.

573
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,820
They were hiding something that was of benefit to them,

574
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,239
but also would benefit others.

575
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,000
There was no way they could consume all the food.

576
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
It's just impossible.

577
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
There's no way they could be able to carry

578
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,380
and use all of the silver and gold and raiment.

579
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,940
If you think about the day in which they lived and all the things that were taking place,

580
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,940
I mean, it's just impossible.

581
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,140
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, we notice in verse number 1, the Bible says, therefore

582
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,340
seeing we have this ministry.

583
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,020
As we have received mercy, we faint not.

584
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,620
Listen, we've been given a ministry.

585
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,300
It's the ministry of reconciliation.

586
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,480
That's what God tells us.

587
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,460
And this ministry of reconciliation that He has given us, if you were to study the fifth

588
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,700
chapter, we don't have time to look at all of that, but you understand how that we that

589
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,340
have been saved, in fact, look at just two verses there in verse number 17 of 2 Corinthians

590
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
chapter number 5.

591
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,660
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

592
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Old things are passed away.

593
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,060
Behold, all things become new.

594
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:51,580
And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given

595
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,260
to us the ministry of reconciliation.

596
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,340
I'm thankful to be reconciled.

597
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,220
Praise the Lord.

598
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,020
But He's given us the ministry of reconciliation.

599
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,060
He says that we have this ministry, but I want you to also notice in verse number 1,

600
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,780
it says, as we have received mercy, we faint not.

601
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,820
I'm thankful that God said He would go with us.

602
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
He promises to go with us.

603
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,580
He gave us the power of the gospel.

604
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,520
Notice in verse number 2, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking

605
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,460
in craftiness or handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth,

606
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,600
submitting ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

607
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,380
But if our gospel, what does it say?

608
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,380
Be hid.

609
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
What were they doing with the goods?

610
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
They were hiding them.

611
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,420
They were hiding them.

612
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,260
And as they're in the very act of hiding these things, again, in your mind's eye, get the

613
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
picture this evening.

614
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,460
They go in, they leave the gate of Samaria where they were.

615
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
They're leprous men.

616
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,760
They say, if we stay here, we're going to die.

617
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,460
If we go to Samaria, we're going to die.

618
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,100
If we go to the Syrians, there's a chance, possibly, we may be spared.

619
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,540
And they go, and they find no man.

620
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,380
They go into a tent, and they eat, and they drink, and they find the silver and the gold

621
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,060
and the raiment, and they take it, and they hide it, and they go into another tent, and

622
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,460
they take more, and they hide it, and at that time, they're convicted.

623
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,980
They say, we do not well.

624
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,500
We do not well.

625
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,740
Today is a day of glad tidings, of good tidings, and we hold our peace.

626
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,760
And Paul says here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, speaking to New Testament believers

627
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:32,740
that if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

628
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,700
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.

629
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,100
In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest

630
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,100
the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto

631
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
them.

632
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,419
I'm so thankful for the truth of verse number 5, for we preach not ourselves, it is not

633
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:55,500
about us.

634
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,300
We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.

635
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,500
Isn't that a great message?

636
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,260
And ourselves, your servants for Jesus' sake, for God who commanded the light to shine out

637
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,440
of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory

638
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,540
of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

639
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:20,419
This leads us in verse number 7, but we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the

640
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:25,540
excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.

641
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,940
Listen this evening, as we make a spiritual application for us as New Testament believers

642
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,419
from this portion of Scripture in 2 Kings chapter number 7, and we look at these four

643
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:42,940
leprous men, they said, we do not well.

644
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,139
We're going about this the wrong way.

645
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:48,340
We can't hold our peace.

646
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:55,940
Remember, no one told those four men to go and tell anyone.

647
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,059
You know one great difference for you and I?

648
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,860
Our King has told us to go and tell.

649
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:10,820
He has commissioned us to be His representatives, to be His ambassadors, to go and proclaim

650
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,660
a message that the world needs.

651
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,059
I understand that oftentimes they reject the message.

652
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,059
They don't respond as they should.

653
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,059
I was leaving here this afternoon and was chatting with some folks that were having

654
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:28,500
lunch over in the fellowship hall, and as I made my way out, there was an Amazon man

655
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,179
that was making a delivery.

656
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:36,179
I walked out literally just as he was walking up the steps toward the fellowship hall.

657
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,179
And he handed me the box.

658
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,179
I took the box.

659
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,179
He said, I need to take a picture.

660
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,339
I held it out so he could take a picture.

661
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,339
I said, hey, what's your name?

662
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,339
He said, my name is Esau.

663
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,339
I said, really?

664
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:44,339
I said, that's pretty awesome.

665
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,339
I said, do you know anything about Esau in the Bible?

666
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,339
He's like, Esau's in the Bible?

667
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,339
I said, yeah, Esau's in the Bible.

668
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,339
I said, how'd you get your name?

669
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:49,339
He said, my mom gave it to me.

670
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,339
And I thought, yeah, it was kind of a dumb question, right?

671
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,339
Like, how'd I get my name, right?

672
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,339
But I was thinking, like, is it a family name, right?

673
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:53,339
That was my thought.

674
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,339
But he just said, my mom gave it to me.

675
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:55,339
And I thought, well, that's typically how it works, I guess.

676
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,339
And he said, how'd you get your name?

677
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,339
I said, how'd you get your name?

678
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:58,339
He said, my mom gave it to me.

679
00:34:58,339 --> 00:34:59,339
And I thought, yeah, it was kind of a dumb question, right?

680
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,339
Like, how'd I get my name, right?

681
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,339
But I was thinking, like, is it a family name, right?

682
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:05,580
That was my thought.

683
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,260
But he just said, my mom gave it to me.

684
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,480
And I thought, well, that's typically how it works, I guess.

685
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,540
I said, so you're not a junior, it's not a family name?

686
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
He said, no.

687
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,899
I said, man, last Sunday night, I was preaching about Jacob and Esau.

688
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:23,820
And after 20 years and all the circumstances that had caused me to be divided, how they

689
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
met again.

690
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,420
And there was a reconciliation and there was forgiveness.

691
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,860
What a great, just a reunion that God gave them.

692
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,140
I began to talk to him about Esau.

693
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,860
And he was listening there and he had to kind of go.

694
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,380
And I said, listen, I said, do you go to church anywhere?

695
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,940
You know, that typical response.

696
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,940
I said, listen, man, more important than going to church, knowing for sure when you die,

697
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,940
you're going to go to heaven.

698
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,459
So are you 100% sure if you're going to die, you're going to go to heaven?

699
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,459
He said, I hope so.

700
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:57,420
You know how many people say, I hope so?

701
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,580
I hope so.

702
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,860
I said to that man, Esau, I said, Esau, how are you going to get to heaven?

703
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,300
You say you're hoping that you're going to get there.

704
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
How are you going to get there?

705
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,220
He said, well, I'm doing the best I can, trying to do good.

706
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,980
You know how many people have that thought as well?

707
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,220
And here's what I said to Esau, I said, Esau, what if God says that your good is not good

708
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
enough?

709
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
He said, well, then I'll do better.

710
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,380
That's what he said to me, right in the steps, I'll do better.

711
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,980
I said, and what if God says that you're better is not good enough?

712
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,220
He said, well, I don't know what's better than better, but I'll do what I got to do.

713
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
That's what he said to me.

714
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,380
And I said, Esau, can I tell you that God tells us in His Word that all of our good

715
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,820
works are as filthy rags?

716
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,920
Because we're not saved by our own good works.

717
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,559
We can't get to heaven by our own good works.

718
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,399
At that particular time, I shared a couple of other Bible verses with him, and I could

719
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:05,320
tell he was getting antsy to go make the next deliveries, probably dealing with some conviction

720
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,660
because the Bible was being used, I was quoting Scripture to him.

721
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,800
Before he left our property, I said, listen, Esau, will you promise that you'll read that

722
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
gospel tract?

723
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
He said, I will.

724
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,600
And I pray that he does, and I pray that he gets saved.

725
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,160
And why do I share that testimony with you this evening?

726
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,679
Because there are people that need to hear the truth.

727
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:35,760
As we think about the blessing that God has given us and saving us, and we recognize this

728
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,239
evening that we've received eternal life, but He's the Savior of the world, and there's

729
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,559
a lost and dying world.

730
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:51,760
And God in His infinite mercy and His infinite wisdom, He has determined that it's saved

731
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,040
people that tell lost people how to get saved.

732
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,880
He didn't write the gospel in the stars.

733
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
He didn't.

734
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,119
He didn't make the rocks cry out the gospel.

735
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,160
He told us as His people, go and tell.

736
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,399
Go and tell.

737
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,239
Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

738
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:22,640
That's what He told us in His Word.

739
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:33,479
And this evening, as we think about receiving and recognizing, we noted how they responded,

740
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,400
those four leprous men.

741
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,599
And I ask you this evening, how will we respond?

742
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,200
Will we hold our peace or will we go and tell?

743
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,220
Because really, there's only two options.

744
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,039
As those four leprous men were there, they had two options, to hold their peace or to

745
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,039
go and tell.

746
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,320
To hold our peace or to go and tell.

747
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:10,119
I'm going to read to you a note that Brother Stephen Trell wrote just a couple of weeks

748
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,479
before the Lord called him home.

749
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:18,720
He jotted it down on a napkin at a little restaurant.

750
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,440
Here's what he said, "'Cowardice is contagious, but courage is also contagious.

751
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,640
If I am willing to go over the ramparts, I might be surprised to see who would follow

752
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,039
me if I will but issue the challenge of come with me.'"

753
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,919
I think about those words that he wrote, just simple words.

754
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:48,200
But a heart that said, I've received something, I've received eternal life and I can't just

755
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,039
hold my peace.

756
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,880
I must go and tell.

757
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,599
You know how many people tried to tell Stephen not to go to Baghdad, Iraq?

758
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,479
Scores, scores of people.

759
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:06,819
I would sit and talk with him, and he'd tell me about meetings that he had at churches

760
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:13,419
where pastors would say, don't go there, you're going to die there.

761
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,419
Don't go there.

762
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:17,159
You know what he said?

763
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,299
God's called me.

764
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:24,539
I can't let my gospel be hid.

765
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:30,539
And this evening, unfortunately, scores of people that would try to discourage someone

766
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:37,179
from following God's will for their life without any risk, I should say with little risk of

767
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:44,059
any personal harm in this country, hold their peace.

768
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:47,819
Hold their peace, and we can go in town.

769
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:55,939
Those four leprous men, it's an amazing event that took place, and a count in Israel's history.

770
00:40:55,939 --> 00:41:00,819
But I believe tonight there's a spiritual application for each and every one of us,

771
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:01,819
and it's in that response.

772
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:02,819
What are we going to do?

773
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:07,279
Are we going to hold our peace, or are we going to go in town?

774
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,279
Let's pray together.

775
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:12,599
Father, how we love you.

776
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,679
Thank you for loving us.

777
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:25,879
God, I pray that you would help us to be obedient to the command that you've given us to go

778
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:30,199
and tell, to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

779
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:37,439
I pray, God, that as we've looked at this account in Israel's history, we've sought

780
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:40,239
to make spiritual application.

781
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:47,519
Lord, that you'd help us in these quiet moments of invitation to be doers of the Word.

782
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:55,199
Help us to be purposed in our confronting people and engaging people with the gospel.

783
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,759
Help us to be armed with gospel tracts.

784
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:05,399
Help us to be diligent in seizing the opportunities that you'd give us.

785
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:11,759
I pray, Father, that not one of us would be guilty of holding our peace, of hiding

786
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:17,959
the gospel, knowing that if our gospel be hid, it's hid to them that are lost.

787
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:23,399
I pray, God, that you'd work, move in a distinct way tonight, and we'll be careful to give

788
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:25,919
you the honor and glory for all that you'll do.

789
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
