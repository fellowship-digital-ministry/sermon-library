1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,199
before and just be looking at a few verses of scripture this evening in the book of Philippians.

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:09,279
And of course, as you know, here on Wednesday evenings for the last couple of months, we've

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,539
been dealing with the subject matter of teach me.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,680
And we began this series by looking at the psalmist and looking at the heart cry, the

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,399
plea of the psalmist when he says, teach me.

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,840
And I'm so thankful that he desires to teach us.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,280
And of course, as we echo the words of the psalmist and we have that heart attitude

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,680
of surrender and humility, and we recognize that we need to be taught of the Lord, he

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,680
will teach us many valuable lessons.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,400
The last couple of weeks on Wednesday evening, we've kind of dealt with various classrooms

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,159
of instruction, various means in which God will use in our lives to teach us certain

12
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,479
lessons.

13
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,720
And this evening, I want to look at this passage of scripture here in Philippians chapter four,

14
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,840
Look in verse number 10 with me nearing the end of this book.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
And the Bible says,

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,400
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,239
again, wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:20,239
Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith

19
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,879
to be content.

20
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,319
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound everywhere, and in all things

21
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:34,360
I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,239
And we're just going to look at verses 10 through 12 this evening of Philippians four.

23
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,599
It's interesting to me because two of the subjects that Paul references in the book

24
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,160
of Philippians are joy and contentment.

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,519
It's very interesting when you consider the fact that Paul is writing from a Roman prison

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,879
and it's great impact in my life when I think about him writing from a Roman prison and

27
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,360
understanding the circumstances in which he was dealing with.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,720
And yet throughout these four chapters, two of the subjects that are referenced often

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,480
are the idea of joy.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,119
Of course, that's the broader, the more common theme of the book of Philippians, but he also

31
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:17,360
deals with the subject of contentment here in this passage of scripture.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,199
When we think about these two particular subjects, joy and contentment, we understand

33
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,279
that they're needed in our lives even today.

34
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:32,139
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message this evening, I have learned to be content.

35
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,000
I have learned to be content.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,399
The word content, according to the 1828 Webster's Dictionary, here's a definition and I like

37
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,399
this.

38
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:50,979
It says, rest or quietness of mind in the present condition, satisfaction which holds

39
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,759
the mind in peace, restraining complaint.

40
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,919
That's a good definition.

41
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,919
Let me say it again, content, rest or quietness of mind in the present condition.

42
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:12,759
So, many people say, I'd be content if, no, no, content is that rest, that quietness in

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,320
the present condition.

44
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,919
Whatever it is, Paul says here, whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

45
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,839
So, we see in that present condition, and then it goes on to say the satisfaction which

46
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:31,000
holds the mind in peace, restraining complaint.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,759
And what a great need for us when we think about the subject and how Paul says, I have

48
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:44,679
learned, in whatsoever state I am, I have learned to be content.

49
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:50,880
As we think about this lesson that Paul learned and a lesson that we could learn, I want you

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,720
to think about some things because I find in verse number 11, when Paul makes the statement,

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
it's very informative to me.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,039
Notice again in verse number 11, he says, not that I speak in respect of want.

53
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,800
Now, understand, he's writing to these Philippian believers, and contextually, as you study

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,679
the book, as you understand during his missionary journey, the way in which the church at Philippi

55
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,600
communicated with the Apostle Paul.

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,720
In other words, they were giving to his needs.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,940
They were sacrificial in their giving.

58
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,559
They were praying for the Apostle Paul.

59
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:27,519
He mentions that later on near the end of the chapter here, the end of the book, and

60
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,839
he says that in verse number 10, I rejoiced in the Lord greatly.

61
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,839
Why?

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,799
That now at the last, your care of me hath flourished again.

63
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:43,200
And he says later on in verse number 14 that ye did communicate with my affliction.

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,920
In verse number 15, now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,000
I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Notice this.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
But ye only.

68
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:04,040
So, Paul is rejoicing because of the opportunity that they had to partner with him and to invest

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,079
in the ministry, and he says at the end of the verse, he says, wherein ye were also careful,

70
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,480
but ye lacked opportunity.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,320
Now, look in verse number 11.

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,299
He says, not that I speak in respect of want.

73
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,359
He's not writing to them.

74
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,239
He's not saying I'm speaking, I'm not speaking in respect of want, and then he says this,

75
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:28,559
For I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.

76
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,760
This statement in verse number 11 is very informative to me.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,239
Number one, I would say this, to be content is not our default setting.

78
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:41,320
To be content is not my default setting.

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,920
To be content is not your default setting.

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,399
I mentioned on Sunday morning when I preached the message there from Numbers 11, when the

81
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,880
people complained, and I said this in that message, that the default setting for the

82
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,399
children of Israel was to complain.

83
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,600
Every time something went a little bit off course for the children of Israel, their default

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
setting was to complain.

85
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,000
It was not, what is God doing in this situation?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
What is God going to do miraculously?

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,940
We've seen him do this, we've observed his power here, and the excitement, the anticipation

88
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,600
of what is God going to do?

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
No, their default setting was to complain.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,559
We looked at that thoroughly on Sunday morning, and as I look at this subject and consider

91
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:28,720
this lesson learned by the Apostle Paul, I would say to be content, it's not our default

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
setting.

93
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,880
If you think about babies, babies, you don't have to teach them to be discontent.

94
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,920
They cry just for the purpose of being held, and they want what some other child in the

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,920
nursery has, and you can understand if you've worked in the nursery, if you've worked amongst

96
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,920
children, even your own children, and you just kind of can see there's an immediate

97
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,920
understanding that they don't have to be taught to be discontent, and neither do we.

98
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,359
To be content is not my default setting.

99
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:10,000
I must therefore, as Paul says, I, we must learn to be content.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,480
And I would ask this question, I asked myself as I was preparing the message, and I asked

101
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,000
myself this question, I wonder what it is that I would say, I wonder this evening what

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,679
it is that you would say, I wonder if we would say this, I have learned to be content.

103
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:29,440
Or maybe, here's what I would say, I am learning to be content.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,279
I can't be where the Apostle Paul is, I'm just being transparent and honest with you

105
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,279
this evening.

106
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,839
I'm not to that point where I have learned that I can say I have learned in what sort

107
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,640
of state I am there with to be content.

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,679
That's my goal, that's my aim, that's my desire.

109
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:48,880
But the reality is that if I'm honest and I evaluate appropriately before the Lord,

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,760
and I'm honest with you this evening, I have to say I am learning in what sort of state

111
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,880
I am there with to be content.

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,440
And I think for most of us, that's probably where we are.

113
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,160
We're learning.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,679
We're learning to be content.

115
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:07,480
And so we have this subject matter of teach me, and we see that Paul specifically says

116
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,359
I've learned this truth, I've learned this lesson in what sort of state I am there with

117
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,359
to be content.

118
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:18,440
I would ask the question, if we understand this evening that it's not my default setting,

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,839
if I understand this evening that I must learn to be content, I would ask the question, how

120
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,940
is it that we learn to be content?

121
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,359
What is it that God does in our life to teach us contentment that we can come to the place

122
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:36,479
where we say, as Paul said, I have learned in what sort of state I am there with to

123
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,479
be content?

124
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,000
I would say this, Paul learned this lesson, I believe, in the classroom of want.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
He learned this lesson in the classroom of want.

126
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,760
We talked last week about the classroom of loneliness with Joseph and the great lessons

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,239
that he learned in the classroom of loneliness, and we find this evening that Paul says not

128
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:58,979
that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in what sort of state I am there with

129
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,200
to be content.

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,679
Notice what he says in verse number 12, I know both how to be abased and I know how

131
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,679
to abound.

132
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:12,979
Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to

133
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,359
abound and to suffer need.

134
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:20,039
I believe that it's in this classroom of want that God often will teach us the subject of

135
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,239
contentment and understanding that He gives us that which we need.

136
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:32,080
See there's this inappropriate perspective that is so common in our society today, and

137
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,000
it's not just common amongst Bible believers, I believe that it's common amongst generally

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,440
within society, and that is this, if we have plenty, then we're having God's favor, God's

139
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,760
pleased with us.

140
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Why?

141
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,859
Because we're abounding, we have plenty.

142
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:54,320
And if we lack, well then that's God's judgment.

143
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,440
But, you know, that's not true biblically.

144
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,960
Biblically, we understand that there are times in which, if you think about the church of

145
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,520
the Laodiceans, when they're increased with goods and have need of nothing, that's what

146
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,239
they're indicted for, right?

147
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,919
Because they're in a place where they think, I don't need anything, not even God really

148
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,679
is what's being referred to there in Revelation chapter number 3.

149
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,880
And we think about this perspective that is skewed by the world in which we live, and

150
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,080
we must understand biblically that the reality is that, look, the children of Israel, when

151
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Jeremiah is prophesying to Judah, and Jeremiah, the captivity takes place, and these guys

152
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,440
say go pray for us, and whatever God says we're going to do, and then Jeremiah comes

153
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,679
and gives them the message, and they say no, we're not going to do that because you're

154
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,159
lying to us, and then they have this perspective, when we were offering to the queen of heaven,

155
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,599
we had all of these things, we weren't suffering, we weren't having this trouble, and so here's

156
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:55,960
what we're going to do, we're going to go back to doing that.

157
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,000
Terrible perspective, terrible perspective.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,059
And this evening, if I'm going to learn to be content, oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes

159
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,960
God will use that classroom of want, but I would say this, what really helps us to learn

160
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:19,679
this contentment into being content is having a proper view of God.

161
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,559
Because the reality is that in verse number 11, Paul says in the middle of what I've used

162
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,640
as the title this evening, I have learned to be content, he says this, in whatsoever

163
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,960
state I am.

164
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,599
In whatsoever state I am.

165
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:39,719
So when I have a proper view of God, when I understand that present condition, remember

166
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:44,159
that was part of that definition that I shared of what it means to be content in the present

167
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,679
condition, it's not being content in what we think will make us content, it's being

168
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,280
content in contentment, true contentment is in whatever our present condition is, in that

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,520
whatsoever state I am.

170
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,039
And we find that he says I know how to be abased, I know how to abound, but the reality

171
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,760
is that if I understand this evening, and I have a proper view of God, and I understand

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,760
tonight that God is in control, that God is sovereign, we believe that biblically,

173
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,840
the Bible clearly communicates to us as the people of God that he is sovereign, that he

174
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,679
rules in the affairs of mankind.

175
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,400
And when we understand that this evening, when we have that proper view of God, when

176
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,119
we see him as Isaiah saw him, high, holy, and lifted up, and we see him sitting upon

177
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:41,520
his throne, and we understand that he's in control, then, since God, because we understand

178
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,640
that God is in control, then we also must understand that he has allowed whatever state

179
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm in, and he's allowed it for his purpose.

180
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,960
He's allowed it for his glory.

181
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,960
And so Paul is sitting in a Roman prison, he's writing to the church in Philippi, and

182
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,520
he's writing to them about rejoicing, about being joyful, but he's also writing to them

183
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,080
about being content, and he's saying, I have learned in what sort of state I am therewith

184
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,799
to be content.

185
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,280
Sitting in a Roman prison, Paul was content.

186
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,679
Paul was content.

187
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,919
You say, I don't get it.

188
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,159
How?

189
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,000
How could you be content in that situation?

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,919
Because he knew God was in control.

191
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,840
He knew that his life was in God's hands.

192
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,760
And when we understand this evening, we sing songs about the fact that I am his, and I

193
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,119
belong to him, and here, Lord, here's my life.

194
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:47,020
I give you control, and take my life, and let it be, and we sing songs such as that,

195
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:55,479
but the reality is that as we surrender to God, we sing, I surrender all.

196
00:13:55,479 --> 00:14:00,200
Sometimes when we think about all those songs, we say, I'm in God's hands, and God has a

197
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,719
perfect plan and a perfect purpose for everything that he allows, and so therefore, I can be

198
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:13,840
content because I know that God's in control, and I know that he has a purpose.

199
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Think about this.

200
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,799
We're going to work backwards and make our way to Philippians 1, but look in Philippians

201
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,799
4.

202
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,080
We're in verses 10 through 12, but look back in verse number 4, a verse that many of us

203
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
have memorized.

204
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:35,200
Rejoice in the Lord always, and again, I say rejoice.

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,260
Now, how can I rejoice in the Lord always?

206
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,960
Because he's always good, because he's sovereign, because he's God, because he has a plan, because

207
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,900
he has a purpose, and as I'm rejoicing, that is evidence of that contentment, right?

208
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,940
Because remember, I mentioned in that definition that content, to be content, is that satisfaction

209
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,780
which holds the mind in peace, restraining complaint.

210
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,500
So instead of me complaining about my circumstances, instead of me complaining about my lot in

211
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,419
life, I'm understanding that God's in control, I've learned to be content, and I'm rejoicing.

212
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,500
Why?

213
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Because God has a plan.

214
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,859
I was talking to one of our missionaries on Monday afternoon.

215
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,419
Actually, it was early evening when I was speaking to him, and it was actually Lacy

216
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,700
Wheeler down in Mexico, and I had mentioned a few weeks ago about him sending me a video

217
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,619
of them getting some scriptures down into Honduras and the vehicle breaking down and

218
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:37,619
them having to be towed and just all the situation with that.

219
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,940
And we were rehearsing and talking about that because we were talking about getting scriptures

220
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,419
in Guatemala and some of the difficulties that they had, and they were aiming to go

221
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:48,559
there and ended up in Honduras because of some border issues.

222
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,880
But the reality is that when they're in Honduras, man, the vehicle that's got all the scriptures

223
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
in it, it breaks down.

224
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:01,919
And you can get all kinds of bothered and sideways and upset, but because it broke down

225
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,320
where it did, they had more opportunities.

226
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,080
You mean to tell me that God isn't in control?

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,000
He could keep that vehicle running.

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,559
He could allow that vehicle.

229
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,400
We in our minds, we could say, well, there's a better place where I could have broken down.

230
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,440
God says, no, no, I allowed you to break down exactly where I allowed you to break down.

231
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Why?

232
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Because I have a purpose.

233
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,960
I have a plan.

234
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,799
And there were contacts that were made in that particular village and then in the adjacent

235
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,599
city that never would have been made had they not broken down where they did.

236
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,520
So we learn to be content.

237
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,960
I am learning to be content.

238
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,640
Rejoice in the Lord always.

239
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,159
And again, I say rejoice.

240
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,880
We looked at this verse on Sunday morning, but turn back, if you will, to chapter number

241
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,440
two and look at verse number 14.

242
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,159
We kind of finished with this verse on Sunday, but here in Philippians 2 and verse 14, do

243
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,559
all things without murmurings and disputings.

244
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:00,599
Again, we see all things, not some things, not the things that we enjoy, not the things

245
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,319
that we want to do, but do all things without murmurings and disputings.

246
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,959
And we understand that God gives us the ability to do that.

247
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
And I'll turn back to chapter one and look at verse number 12.

248
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,319
I often reference this verse of Scripture.

249
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,800
I'll be honest with you, it's one of the verses of Scripture that has had a profound impact

250
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
in my life.

251
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,400
And I'm thankful for God's Word.

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,760
There's so many verses of Scripture that I could go to and I could say, God used these

253
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,920
verses in such a profound way in my life.

254
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,000
And this is one of them.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,079
This is definitely in the top, I'll say, 25 verses that I would run to and say, God used

256
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,680
this verse in my life.

257
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,400
And notice what Paul says to these believers in Philippi.

258
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,760
He says, but I would, ye should understand, brethren, that the things which have happened

259
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,239
unto me have fallen out rather under the furtherance of the gospel.

260
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:56,199
Now those things that happened unto Paul, he says that he wanted these believers in

261
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,000
Philippi to understand this.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,520
He wanted them to have a knowledge of this.

263
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,079
He goes right into the next verse and speaks about the bonds that he has in Christ.

264
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,119
And when you begin to understand, listen, for Paul, the things that happened to him

265
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:14,319
are different than the things that happened to you, than the things that happened to me.

266
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,040
But the reality is that we all have things that happen in our life.

267
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,380
And when we understand that those things that happen in our lives are ordained by God who

268
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,959
is sovereign and who is in control, and we understand that he has a greater purpose and

269
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:36,839
why he's allowed those things, I can be content.

270
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,040
I can rest and rejoice.

271
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,319
Why?

272
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,479
Because my God's in control and he makes no mistakes.

273
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,239
You believe this evening that he doeth all things well?

274
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,239
I do.

275
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,239
I believe that.

276
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,239
He doeth all things well.

277
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,599
He makes no mistakes.

278
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,680
In this evening, as we think about this truth of how do we learn contentment, there are

279
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,920
times in which God will use the classroom of want.

280
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,040
It is absolutely essential that we have that proper view of who God is and that we just

281
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,439
remove ourselves from that inappropriate perspective that is so common in our society today that

282
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:19,000
plenty equals God's favor and lack equals God's judgment, but that we would learn that

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,479
God is in control and God has a plan and God reigns supreme, and I can be content in whatsoever

284
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,479
state I am.

285
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:32,119
Turn over to the book of Hebrews, if you will, in chapter 13.

286
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,520
Look at two verses as we close this evening, one here from the New Testament, one from

287
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
the Old.

288
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:45,479
In Hebrews 13 and verse number 5, the Bible says this, Hebrews 13 and verse number 5,

289
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:55,520
let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have,

290
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,239
for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say,

291
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:07,439
the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

292
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,599
You know, we have so many things that money cannot buy.

293
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,400
So many people today are looking to be content in the things that they can buy and how they

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,920
can have more and how that's going to bring them a level of contentment, but here the

295
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,199
Bible says that we're to let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with

296
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:34,839
such things as you have, and then he reminds us of the promise of God's presence, that

297
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,520
he said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

298
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,599
He reminds us that that means that we can boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

299
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,839
Aren't you thankful for that?

300
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,439
He says, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

301
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:54,000
In closing this evening, we see it here in verse number 5 when he speaks about covetousness

302
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and contentment.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Turn to the book of Jeremiah, if you will.

304
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,359
Let me just give you a warning as we close this evening.

305
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,560
Beware of the enemy of contentment.

306
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,959
You know what the enemy is of contentment?

307
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,160
It's covetousness.

308
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,119
And we see in Jeremiah chapter 6, very quickly, I want you to see what the Bible says about

309
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,680
this thing of covetousness.

310
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,800
No doubt we see this in our society today, and it's the enemy of contentment.

311
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,880
And if I'm seeking to learn to be content, if I'm desiring to learn what Paul learned,

312
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,319
what he references here in the book of Philippians, then I must be aware of what the enemy of

313
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,640
contentment is.

314
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,359
Listen, we live in a society that bombards us with advertisements, the marketing industry

315
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,239
on telling you what you need and why you need it, right?

316
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,239
Don't we?

317
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:53,280
I mean, there are things that you purchase that you never even thought you needed, but

318
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,439
you saw some kind of something and it's like, man, I guess I do need that.

319
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,239
I've never been able to operate without that.

320
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,479
I mean, isn't that amazing?

321
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:06,199
And that's what the marketing industry, that's what they do, that's why they exist.

322
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,839
Look at Jeremiah 6 and verse 13.

323
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:18,359
For from the least of them, even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to covetousness.

324
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,599
And from the prophet, even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.

325
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,319
That is a sad indictment on the children of Israel, is it not?

326
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,040
Judah, terrible indictment.

327
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,160
Every one of them, from the least, even to the greatest, every one of them is given to

328
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,239
covetousness, and every one of them, from the prophet, even unto the priest, dealeth

329
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,959
falsely.

330
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:49,000
This morning, this evening, whatever it is, this evening, our society is geared to cause

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,959
us to be covetous.

332
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:58,439
But as we look in the Word of God, we're to be content.

333
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:02,160
And Paul says, I have learned.

334
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,359
I learned a valuable lesson.

335
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:12,079
What I learned is in what sort of state I am therewith to be content.

336
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,800
This evening, as I mentioned already, I would simply say I am learning to be content.

337
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,640
But I want to be able to reach that place where I can say, I have learned to be content.

338
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Amen?

339
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,800
Because, listen, somebody said this, when God is all you have, you find out for the

340
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,680
first time in your life that God is all you need.

341
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,119
He's saying in a little course, He's all I need.

342
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,119
He really is.

343
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,599
And He takes such good care of us.

344
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:46,119
And oh, that we learn to be content, and it will lead us to a place of rejoice in the

345
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,119
Lord always.

346
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,280
And again, I say rejoice.

347
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Why?

348
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,719
Because there's no room for complaint.

349
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:56,599
Complaint has been restrained because I've learned to be content.

350
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,599
Let's pray.

351
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,780
Father, we love You.

352
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,560
We thank You for loving us.

353
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,000
I thank You for the testimony of the Apostle Paul here in this passage of Scripture.

354
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,040
And God, I pray that You'd help each of us this evening.

355
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:18,800
Lord, I pray that You would help us to evaluate honestly our lives in this area of contentment.

356
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,599
That God, You would help us to be in a place, perhaps there's some that could say with Paul

357
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,319
that I have learned to be content.

358
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,479
Perhaps there's others that would say I am learning to be content.

359
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,079
I pray that it'd be each of our desires that, God, You would teach us contentment, that

360
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:43,400
You'd help us, Lord, to see You in Your proper place, Lord, to understand that You're sovereign

361
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,640
in control.

362
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,839
You do all things well, that You make no mistakes, and help us, Lord, to be content.

363
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,040
Thank You for the privilege of prayer.

364
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,839
I pray that You'd bless our time, and we'll thank You for all that You'll do, for it's

365
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,839
in Christ's name we pray.

366
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,839
Amen.

367
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,339
Does anyone need a bulletin this evening?

368
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,500
You did not get one when you came in.

369
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,099
You need one?

370
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:04,619
Miss Dionne.
