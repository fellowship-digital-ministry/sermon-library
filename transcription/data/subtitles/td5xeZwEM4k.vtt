WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
All right, good evening, and due to the wintry weather that we're experiencing, we made the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.199
decision to go ahead and record the message earlier this evening than our normal scheduled

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:16.040
time at 7 p.m., and so we're going to continue with our study.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.319
The last few weeks we've been dealing with the doctrine of Christ, and so if you would

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:24.360
take your Bible and turn to the book of 1 Peter, 1 Peter chapter number 2, and as we've

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.760
been studying the doctrine of Christ, we answered that question that Jesus asked the disciples

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.119
in Matthew chapter number 16.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.759
You'll recall a few weeks ago we dealt with that, and he said this,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:38.000
Whom do men say that I am?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.119
Of course, the disciples said some say that you're John the Baptist, some say Jeremiah

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:48.080
or Isaiah or one of the other prophets, and Jesus then said to his disciples,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.400
But whom do you say that I am?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.000
And of course, Peter stood up with great confidence, and he said,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.520
And what a great declaration that was made there by Peter, and I think about Peter making

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.760
that declaration, and I think about Peter and how we can relate to him, and then as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.959
we think about Peter being used of the Lord in the start of the early church, you can

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:15.720
see the way God used him through the book of Acts, and then as he was used of God to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.559
write 1 and 2 Peter, and we read 1 Peter and just read about the way in which Peter is

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:29.360
seeking to encourage these believers, and he says this in chapter number 2, in verse

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.040
number 2, As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.559
he says, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious, I think Peter understood

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:47.440
personally how gracious our God is, and he's speaking to these believers, and he's speaking

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.519
about the graciousness of our God, and then if you skip down to verse number 7, it says,

00:01:52.519 --> 00:02:00.519
Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious, I think each of us would agree, those of us

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:06.680
that know the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, that indeed, he is precious, and many

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.880
have written songs about our Savior and just our relationship to him, he's a wonderful

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.360
Savior to me, and we think about that song, and we think about the song, Jesus is all

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.479
the world to me, and we've actually used that as our title last Wednesday evening, Jesus

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:29.759
is all the world to me, that was part 1, today will be a continuation of that study, and

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:35.720
so if you are taking notes, Jesus is all the world to me, part 2, and as we think about

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.800
this declaration of the songwriter, Jesus is all the world to me, why? And as believers,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.320
I think that we would agree with the songwriter that Jesus indeed is all the world to me,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.600
but why is that? I do not in any way suggest that the reasons that I will provide you with

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.119
are an exclusive list, or excuse me, an exhaustive list, we find that there are many, many reasons

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:08.039
that we could give as to why Jesus is all the world to me, I have, for the purpose of

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:14.000
this study, tried to narrow it down to five particular areas, and in our study last Wednesday

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.639
evening, part 1 of Jesus is all the world to me, we said this, why? Because of who He

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.399
is, He is God, and we dealt with the humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ, we then went and

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:32.839
dealt with the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, that He indeed is God in flesh, and what a

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:40.240
joy to know who He is, then we looked at this, Jesus is all the world to me, why? Because

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.639
of His mighty power. As you study through the Word of God, you understand that God has

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.479
all power, you understand that God has demonstrated His power in a multitude of ways throughout

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:56.320
the Scriptures, and as you zero in on the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.240
as recorded in the Gospel records, you have the privilege of being able to see the power

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.360
of God, and when we dealt with the mighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ, we said this,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.899
and we looked at examples throughout the Scriptures, He demonstrated His power over

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:19.600
the demons, He demonstrated His power over disease, He demonstrated His power over death,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.799
and He demonstrated His power over nature. I'm so thankful that our God is omnipotent,

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:30.640
that He has all power, in fact Jesus said before He ascended to heaven, all power is

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.279
given unto me in heaven and in earth, and then He gave the great commission to the disciples.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.200
So as we continue our study this evening, Jesus is all the world to me, part two, we

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.600
would say this, reason number three, because of His death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.600
I'm going to invite you to go to the book of Matthew in the 27th chapter, here in Matthew

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.480
chapter number 27, we'll look through a lengthy portion of Scripture that God has given us

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.679
with regard to this, the death and the burial and the resurrection of our Savior, and as

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.760
you're turning to Matthew 27, I'm going to remind you of what Paul said to the believers

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.920
in the region of Galatia, in Galatians 3 and verse 13, Paul said, Christ hath redeemed

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.200
us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.079
everyone that hangeth on a tree. When we think about the death, burial, and resurrection

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:36.720
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we understand the power of what we're dealing with, and

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.200
the gospel is, as Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 15, the gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.399
of Jesus Christ. And so when we think about Jesus is all the world to me because of His

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.859
substitutionary atonement, and of course He was buried in a borrowed tomb and He rose

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:58.160
conquering sin, death, and the grave, we must consider the suffering at Calvary. In Matthew

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.839
chapter number 27, if you'd begin reading with me in verse number 27, the Bible says

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.119
this, then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered unto

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:16.200
Him the whole band of soldiers, and they stripped Him and put on Him a scarlet robe, and when

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.640
they had plaited a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head and a reed in His right hand.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.239
They bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews. Verse

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:38.679
30 tells us that they spit upon Him, took the reed, and smote Him on the head. And after

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:44.480
they had mocked Him, they took the robe off from Him and put His own raiment on Him and

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.959
led Him away to crucify Him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:58.480
name, Him they compelled to bear His cross. And when they were come unto a place called

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:06.279
Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, they gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:13.279
gall, and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink. And they crucified Him and parted

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:19.480
His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.920
They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture did they cast lots. And sitting

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:33.760
down they watched Him there, and set up over His head His accusation written, This is Jesus,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.440
the King of the Jews. Then were there two thieves crucified with Him, one on the right

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.959
hand and another on the left. And they that passed by reviled Him, wagging their heads."

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.079
Notice what they said in verse number 40,

00:07:51.079 --> 00:08:00.079
Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save thyself, if thou be

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:07.720
the Son of God, come down from the cross. I've not made much commentary through the

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.000
reading of this portion of Scripture, but I'd like to pause just for a moment and mention

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.959
something from verse number 40. I am so thankful that as I read this portion of Scripture,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:28.959
I'm so thankful that Jesus did not come down off of that cross. They say, Save thyself,

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:35.200
if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. He indeed is the Son of God. He

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:42.320
is God in flesh, yet He stayed upon that cross, and I'm so thankful that He did. It was necessary

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:46.880
for Him to stay upon that cross in order to pay for your sin and my sin and the sin of

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.080
the world, and I'm so thankful that He did not come down off of that cross. I'm thankful

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.039
that He finished the work that God gave Him to do. He paid for my sin and your sin. Notice

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:05.039
in verse 41, Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him with the scribes and elders said,

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:12.559
He saved others, Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:21.440
down from the cross, and we will believe Him. I'm thankful that He did save others. I'm

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:27.599
thankful that as we discussed last Wednesday evening, speaking about His mighty power and

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:33.039
how that He demonstrated His power over the demons and over disease and over death and

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:39.440
how He delivered many, many people, and what a joy to see His power revealed through those

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.440
mighty miracles, and I'm thankful that He did save many. I'm thankful that it was not

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.440
a matter of that He could not save Himself, it was that He would not save Himself. Why?

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:57.960
Because He understood that which was before Him. He understood the work that He had to

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960
complete, in fact, all year long.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.160
we've dealt with Hebrews 12

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.220
as being our theme looking unto Jesus.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.920
And what a great theme it's been.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.520
I've thoroughly enjoyed studying

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.920
through the book of Hebrews.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.620
The Bible says looking unto Jesus,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.600
the Author and Finisher of our faith,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.400
who for the joy that was set before Him

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.320
endured the cross,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120
despising the shame,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.720
and is set down at the right hand

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.480
of the throne of God.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.920
I'm thankful that He did not come down

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.760
from that cross.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.080
These that are speaking here

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.600
according to v. 41,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.480
it's the chief priest mocking Him

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.320
with the scribes and elders.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.600
And notice what they say

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.760
at the end of v. 42.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.120
If He were to come down and save Himself,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.800
they would believe Him.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.560
Oh, He had performed countless miracles

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.160
and had demonstrated to them

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.400
on a number of occasions

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.280
that He is God.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.320
And yet, they did not believe.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.600
I'm mindful of the account in John 9.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.640
That's the account in which God gives us

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.480
when the man that was born blind

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.560
that He's healed.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.520
And of course, Jesus healed this man

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.840
and there was much debate

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.080
with regard to this healing.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.840
And they had questioned the man many times

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.680
with regard to what had happened.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.480
And He eventually,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.480
seeming as if He's tired of hearing

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.040
the same questions,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.600
He says, one thing I know

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.920
that whereas I was blind,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.560
now I see in John 9 v. 25.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.760
And then in v. 27,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.960
He answered these that were questioning Him

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.400
and He said, I have told you already,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.440
and you did not hear.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.200
Wherefore would you hear it again?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.920
Will you also be His disciples?

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.520
Then they reviled Him and said,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.920
thou art His disciple,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.440
but we are Moses' disciples.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.160
We know that God spake unto Moses.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.360
As for this fellow,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.000
we know not from whence he is.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.760
And the man that was born blind,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.400
He answered these religious leaders

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.520
and said unto them,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.480
why, herein is a marvelous thing

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.400
that ye know not from whence he is,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.760
and yet, he hath opened mine eyes.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.800
They had seen so many miracles.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.240
Christ had manifested,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.040
demonstrated to them

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.680
that He was the Messiah,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.280
and yet, they're going to say

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.440
that if He were to come down and save Himself,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.880
then they would believe the reality

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.560
is that they had been given much revelation.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.640
Verse 43 back in Matthew 27.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.320
He trusted in God, let Him deliver Him now.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.960
If He will have Him,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.800
for He said, I am the Son of God.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.840
The thieves also which were crucified with Him

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.800
cast the same in His teeth.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800
Verse 45, now from the sixth hour,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.680
there was darkness over all the land

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.960
unto the ninth hour.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.120
And about the ninth hour,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.920
Jesus cried with a loud voice saying,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.960
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.800
That is to say, my God, my God,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.280
why hast Thou forsaken Me?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.000
Some of them that stood there

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.760
when they heard that said,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.640
this man calleth for Elias.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.160
And straightway one of them ran

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.800
and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.400
The rest said, let be.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.920
Let us see whether Elias will come to save him.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.520
Jesus, when He had cried again

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520
with a loud voice,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.880
yielded up the ghost.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.680
As you look at verse 50,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.720
and the Bible says that He cried again

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.840
with a loud voice,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.920
yet Matthew does not record

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.360
what it is that He said.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.520
And I believe that as you compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.640
you would conclude that what He proclaimed

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.080
at this particular moment

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.680
was that great statement,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.240
It is finished.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.040
Verse 51,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.680
And behold, the veil of the temple

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.560
was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.080
The earth did quake and the rocks rent.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.160
We begin to say and agree with the songwriter

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.000
that Jesus is all the world to me.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.040
I would say, yes, He is.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.720
Because of His death, His burial,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.960
and His glorious resurrection.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.680
The substitutionary death of Jesus Christ

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.040
that He went and willingly paid

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.320
the ultimate price to pay for your sin

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.000
and for my sin.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.840
The burial is now in view.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.840
If you skip down to verse 57,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.960
the Bible says when the even was come,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.520
there came a rich man of Arimathea

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.080
named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.320
He went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.160
Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.560
When Joseph had taken the body,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.040
he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.160
and laid it in his own new tomb,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.040
which he had hewn out in the rock.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.400
And he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.840
and departed.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.800
There was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.320
sitting over against the sepulcher.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.120
Now the next day that followed,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.960
on the day of the preparation,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.800
the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.800
In verse number 63,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.440
this is what these religious leaders say to Pilate.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.160
They say, sir, we remember that that deceiver said

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.000
while he was yet alive,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.480
after three days, I will rise again.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.120
It saddens my heart to read verse 63

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.440
and to see how these religious leaders

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.320
refer to my Savior as a deceiver.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.120
The Bible says that Jesus proclaimed in John 14

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.080
in verse number 6,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.200
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.440
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.480
The emphasis from that verse with regard to this statement

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.080
is the fact that He said He was truth.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.520
God is not a man that He should lie.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.440
We understand that our God is not going to be a deceiver,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.560
a liar, and yet they come to Pilate with this terminology

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.040
and then they say, here's what He said,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.960
after three days I will rise again.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.000
Well, He said that because He was going to do that.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.520
We know that in just a few moments

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.600
we're going to read the passage that records for us

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.280
the resurrection of our Savior,

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.560
but you notice that they come

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.400
and they now say, command, in verse 64,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.200
therefore that the sepulcher be made sure

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.320
until the third day.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.160
Lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.360
and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.960
so the last error shall be worse than the first.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.640
Pilate said unto them, you have a watch,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.680
go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.000
So they went and made the sepulcher sure,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.040
sealing the stone and setting a watch.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.920
They were concerned that the disciples might come by night

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.360
and steal away the body of Jesus

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.480
and proclaim that He'd been risen again.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.160
The reality is that the resurrection of Jesus Christ

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.120
had nothing to do with the disciples.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.280
They had no part in the resurrection.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.040
These religious leaders, they set the watch

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.440
and they tried to keep people out,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.440
but the reality is that Jesus would rise,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.800
conquering sin, death, and the grave,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.040
and He would walk out of that borrowed tomb.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.640
In fact, as we think about the section of Scripture,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.920
we enter straight into the declaration of the resurrection

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.720
and we think of, and I've often referred to it as,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.240
the glorious resurrection.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.160
Notice in verse number one of chapter 28,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.320
in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.000
toward the first day of the week,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.880
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.480
to see the sepulcher.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.960
And behold, there was a great earthquake,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.600
for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.640
and came and rolled back the stone from the door

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.040
and sat upon it.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.960
Verse three says, his countenance was like lightning

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.280
and his raiment white as snow.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.480
Notice verse number four,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.000
these folks that they used to set the watch,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.680
they'll be referenced later

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.960
in the passage of Scripture as well.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.840
You could read that later in verses 11 through 15,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.800
but notice what happens to these keepers.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.520
These were the men that were selected

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.000
by these religious leaders to keep the sepulcher.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.720
The Bible says this, and for fear of him,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.880
the keepers did shake and became as dead men.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.640
The angel answered and said unto the women,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.040
verse five, fear not ye,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.960
for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.960
He is not here, for he is risen, as he said.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.600
Those are three precious words to me.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.280
He always does what he says he will do.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.960
He had made the proclamation that he would rise again.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.440
And sure enough, he rose, conquering sin,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.880
death, and the grave.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.720
The invitation that is mentioned in verse number six,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.600
at the end of the verse,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.760
the Bible says that this angel speaks to the women

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.200
and says, come, see the place where the Lord lay,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.880
and go quickly and tell his disciples

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.280
that he is risen from the dead.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.760
And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.640
There shall ye see him.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.679
Lo, I have told you.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.480
And they departed quickly from the sepulcher

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.920
with fear and great joy,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.000
and did run to bring his disciples word.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.080
Wow.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.280
I love reading about the resurrection of our Savior.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.119
As I read about the crucifixion of our Savior,

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:24.000
my heart is saddened to think about what he suffered

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.360
and endured for me.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.240
But I'll tell you, if you ask me this evening,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.679
why is Jesus all the world to you?

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:36.760
If you sing the song that the songwriter has written,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.360
Jesus is all the world to me.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.320
And someone were to come and say, why?

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.840
Why is Jesus all the world to me?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.679
I hope that you'd say, well, because of who he is.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:48.040
He's God.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.760
Because of his mighty power.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.320
Because of his death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.559
We understand as Acts would record for us,

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.840
turn to Acts one just for a moment, if you will.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.240
We understand that after his resurrection.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.920
that He ascended to heaven.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.420
I love the way the book of Acts

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.920
puts it in verse 3

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.340
with regard to the resurrection.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.080
It says in Acts 1 and verse 3,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.380
"...to whom also He showed Himself alive

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.420
after His passion

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.580
by many infallible proofs,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.480
being seen of them forty days."

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.120
And speaking of things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.620
during that period of time,

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.520
He would give instruction to the disciples.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.600
He would, of course, give the Great Commission,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.600
even recorded here in verse 8 of Acts 1.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.900
And then, of course, He would ascend up to heaven.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.600
The Bible says in verse 9,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.300
"...and when He had spoken these things,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.600
while they beheld, He was taken up,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.000
and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.800
as He went up, behold,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.100
two men stood by them in white apparel,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.900
which also said,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.100
Ye men of Galilee,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.400
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.180
This same Jesus,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.180
which was taken up from you into heaven,

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.580
shall so come in like manner

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.680
as ye have seen Him go into heaven."

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.080
Of course, today, we're still awaiting

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.880
the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.380
I don't say it in that manner to say that it's been delayed.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.980
We know that He will not tarry His coming.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.980
He'll come exactly on time,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.280
just as He came the first time.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.780
In fact, during this Christmas season,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.580
we celebrate the first coming

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.380
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.260
But He will return.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.160
And I'm looking for the return of my Savior,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.560
and I believe that it will happen just as He said.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.060
So this evening,

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.760
we see because of His death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.560
Number four, if you're taking notes,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.860
we've said because of who He is,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.260
because of His mighty power,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.960
because of His death, burial, and resurrection.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.560
Number four, we'd say this,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.660
because of His work today.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.660
You understand that as Jesus conquered sin, death,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.040
and the grave, and rising from the dead,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.640
and then ascending up into heaven,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.140
that He is still ministering today,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.840
and He's engaged in a work today

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.340
that ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.140
In fact, throughout this calendar year in 2020,

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.940
we've studied through the book of Hebrews.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.940
And as we've studied through the book of Hebrews,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.740
we have been confronted with much of that work

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.140
that our Savior is doing even now.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.640
And if you'd take and turn to Hebrews chapter number four,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.940
I'd like to read just a few verses of Scripture with you

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.120
with regard to His work today.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.820
I'll make mention of four different aspects

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.020
of His work today.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.920
Number one, He's our great High Priest.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.220
He's our great High Priest.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.220
In Hebrews chapter number four and verse number 14,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.020
the Bible says,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.220
seeing then that we have a great High Priest

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.920
that is passed into the heavens,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.720
Jesus, the Son of God.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.020
Let us hold fast our profession,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.520
for we have not an High Priest

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.800
But as in all points tempted,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.500
like as we are yet without sin,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.000
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.200
that we may obtain mercy

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.800
and find grace to help in time of need.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.800
Over the next several chapters in the book of Hebrews,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.100
chapters five through 10,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.700
you'll begin to read about the priesthood

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.000
of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.800
and how it's superior to the Aaronic priesthood.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.100
Of course, we've studied through these chapters

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.280
and I've preached through them here in 2020.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.580
That content is on our website,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.080
if you'd be interested in going back

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.180
and listening to some of those messages.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.580
I'm so thankful,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.880
when I think about the work of Christ today,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.380
that He is my great High Priest.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.380
Notice, not only is He our great High Priest,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.280
He's our intercessor.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.280
The Bible says in Hebrews chapter number seven,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.980
a few pages over in your Bible,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.480
in verse number 25.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.580
We understand He's speaking about Jesus here.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.060
Notice in verse number 22,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.860
by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.560
And they truly were many priests

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.260
because they were not suffered to continue

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.160
by reason of death.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.960
We understand that in the Old Testament,

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.160
the death of the High Priest and so on and so forth.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.460
Then notice in verse 24,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.660
but this man, because he continueth ever, why?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.360
Because he conquered sin, death and the grave.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.360
He rose in victory, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.360
Wherefore, verse 25,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.140
He is able also to save them to the uttermost

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.940
that come unto God by Him.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.640
I'm thankful for salvation,

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.440
for redemption through the blood.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.240
Then notice the last phrase of the verse,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.240
seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.740
I'm thankful that He is our intercessor.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.940
He's making intercession for us.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.340
Notice, not only is He our great High Priest,

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.640
our intercessor,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.840
number three, He's our advocate.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.140
Turn to the book of 1 John, if you will.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.920
1 John chapter number one reminds us

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.720
of the sweet fellowship that we can have with our Savior.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.120
And I'm so thankful for the privilege of fellowship.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.720
We find that He speaks about the fellowship

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.720
that we have with Him.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.320
Verse three, that which we have seen and heard,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.720
declare we unto you,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720
that you also may have fellowship with us,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.020
and truly our fellowship is with the Father,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.320
and with the Son, Jesus Christ.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.720
These things, right, we unto you,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.920
that your joy may be full in His presence,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.700
His fullness of joy, according to the psalmist.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.000
We find not only the privilege of fellowship,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.900
but we find the promise of forgiveness.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.600
The Bible says in verse number nine,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.800
if we confess our sins,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.900
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.600
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.000
I'm thankful for that great promise of forgiveness.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.700
In the Old Testament, we see that the Bible says

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.600
that God is a God who is ready to pardon,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.800
ready to forgive.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.600
With Thee there is forgiveness.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.280
Here we have this promise of forgiveness.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.080
We enter into the second chapter,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.380
and we find in verse number one,

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.280
the Bible says, my little children,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.380
these things write I unto you,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.880
that ye sin not.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.180
Now we understand biblically

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.680
that we'll never reach a place of sinless perfection.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.880
We'll never be sinless until this mortal puts on immortality

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.780
as I preached on Sunday morning this past week.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.680
But the reality is as a child of God,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.260
I ought to be sinning less each day.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.260
What do I mean by that?

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.860
Well, as I understand the truth of the Word of God,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.860
as I yield myself to Christ,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.460
as I walk in the Spirit

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.460
so that I do not fulfill the lust of the flesh,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.560
as I am crucified with Christ,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.960
I should be sinning less and less.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.360
But we have found it to be so that we continue to sin

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.860
because we have this flesh.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.940
So we find that though we have this flesh

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.640
and though we sin and we seek to not sin,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.640
the promise that is attached here is so precious

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.840
because the Bible says,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.640
and if any man sin,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.740
and you say I'm trying to sin less,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.140
but I'm still sinning,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.340
and I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.740
that if any man sin,

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.740
we have an advocate with the Father,

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.640
Jesus Christ the righteous.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.220
Oh, how precious this truth is.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.520
The Bible tells us that the enemy,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.020
one of the ways in which Satan is described

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.420
is as being the accuser of the brethren.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.020
He'd like to cast accusation at the people of God.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.620
And I'm thankful that though sin no longer

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.120
has dominion over me,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.520
though I can have victory through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.620
and though I seek to walk in the Spirit

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.500
so that I do not fulfill the lust of the flesh,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.200
that when I sin,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.000
I have an advocate with the Father,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.600
a representative.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.700
One who pleads my case.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.000
One who says,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.500
I paid for that.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.800
What a joy, what a blessing.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.200
We think about His work today.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.700
I rejoice that He's my great High Priest.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.700
He's our intercessor.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.000
He's our advocate.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.100
Finally, as we think about His work today,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.680
He's preparing a place for me.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.680
Turn back to the Gospel of John, if you will,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.680
to the 14th chapter.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.280
I want to draw your attention here

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.980
to a precious promise in the Word of God.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.080
In John 14,

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.080
Jesus is speaking to His disciples.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.880
Of course, He would soon go to the cross of Calvary.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.580
It begins the passage by saying,

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.080
let not your heart be troubled.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.080
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.760
My Father's house are many mansions.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.160
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.660
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.560
I'm so thankful for that truth.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.560
He then says this in verse 3,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.860
and if I go, He just said He was,

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.660
and so since He's going

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.660
and preparing a place for you,

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.560
He says this, I will come again

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.960
and receive you unto Myself.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.540
That where I am, there ye may be also.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.540
You know, He's preparing a place for us.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.540
He's preparing a place for me, for you.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.540
It reminds me of what Paul says

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.540
to the believers in Thessalonica

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.540
in 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.540
as he is giving them truth

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.540
with regard to the rapture of the church.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.540
And it says in 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.040
in verse 16,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.120
The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120
with a shout,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.120
with the voice of the archangel,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120
with the trump of God.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.120
Then we which are alive and remain

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.120
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.120
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.120
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.120
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.200
And how comforting these words are for the child.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:07.360
of God. As I begin to think about this study of the doctrine of Christ and I

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:14.840
think about the truth that Peter declared to the Lord Jesus Christ on

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.540
that day nearly 2,000 years ago when Jesus after receiving their answer whom

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:25.000
do men say that I am he says but whom say ye that I am and Peter said thou

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.760
art the Christ the Son of the Living God we find that as we look at that

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.800
declaration that years later Peter as he would sit down under the inspiration of

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.200
the Holy Spirit of God and pen the words of Scripture that he would say in 1st

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.240
Peter chapter number 3 and verse number 7 excuse me chapter number 2 in verse

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:55.140
number 7 unto you therefore which believe he is precious Jesus is all the

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.640
world to me I know that we sing the song I believe that each one of us would

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.640
would proclaim it Jesus is all the world to me but if someone heard you say that

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.840
if someone heard you sing that song and say why why is Jesus all the world to

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.240
you what would you say what would your answer be how long would your list be

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:23.200
as I mentioned in this really gonna be a three-part study of Jesus is all the

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.520
world to me I'm just looking at five different aspects but it's not an

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.200
exhaustive list and I would challenge you to sit down and meditate upon this

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.640
thought meditate upon that wonderful hymn that Jesus is all the world to me

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.880
and say why is he all the world to me and if he is all the world to me I

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.560
ought to be able to give answer as to why he's all the world to me how he's

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.160
changed my life how he's affected me and impacted me and so on and so forth and

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:56.080
we begin to articulate the answer to the question when someone says why is Jesus

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:03.200
all the world to you and if he is all the world to you we would repeat the

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.360
words of John the Baptist when he declared he must increase I must

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:20.440
decrease not only that but we would proclaim to a lost and dying world the

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:26.240
truth of who Jesus is there's as much confusion today as there was when Jesus

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.840
first asked that question to his disciples as recorded in Matthew 16 our

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.560
people all around us that have no idea who Jesus is and for those of us that

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.280
would say Jesus is all the world to me we ought to be equipped and we ought to

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:49.960
have zeal to go out and tell people how wonderful of a Savior he is he is

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.040
precious he is all the world to me father we love you we thank you for

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.520
loving us we thank you for the truth of your word we thank you for the power of

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.720
your word we pray that you would use your word in our hearts in our lives
