1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,579
Number 11, and as you take a moment

2
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:04,559
to grab your Bible and turn there,

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,400
I just wanna once again thank the church

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,020
for your support of our young people.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,960
It is the future of our church,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,159
and we need to invest and influence

7
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:18,440
and pray for the young people,

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,159
and so I wanna encourage you to pray for these

9
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:24,459
that have made decisions and certainly thankful

10
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:27,159
for what God has done in this past week

11
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,719
and how God is working in their lives.

12
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,080
Hebrews chapter number 11, I referenced briefly

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,959
at the end of the message this morning

14
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,279
as we looked at Hebrews 12, one and two

15
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,880
in closing the message this morning,

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,139
I referenced some about this 11th chapter

17
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:43,200
here in the book of Hebrews.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
We've often referred to, I'm sure you've heard somebody

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,779
refer to this passage as being the hall of faith chapter.

20
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:52,439
Many would refer to those that are written here

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,639
and named in this chapter as the heroes of the faith,

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,439
and we see that these are individuals

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,639
that were called by God to fulfill

24
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,199
what God had for them as individuals.

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,260
By faith, they obeyed the Lord,

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,919
they finished, fulfilled what God had for them,

27
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:13,480
and it certainly is encouraging to read this chapter

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,160
and to be encouraged by what God has done in their lives,

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,779
but even before you get into all of the real,

30
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:24,559
maybe well-known events, I notice a statement

31
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:28,120
in verse number five that just captured my attention

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,080
as we were praying for our young people

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,000
throughout the week, being at teen camp,

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,400
and as I was preparing the message this morning

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
and just looking even in our Sunday school class

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,360
this morning with the life of Samuel

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,800
and how the Bible says that Samuel judged Israel

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,440
all the days of his life, and he was faithful to serve God,

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,180
though he had a ministry that was taxing, no doubt,

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,540
traveling from city to city and judging the people,

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,339
and yet, because of his connection to God,

42
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:00,459
we find that he was able to serve God

43
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,739
all the days of his life.

44
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,480
If you look in the passages I mentioned

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,980
in Sunday school this morning,

46
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,100
the key to that portion of scripture

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,500
is that in Ramah, his hometown,

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,580
he built there an altar unto the Lord,

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,179
and how important worship is in our time with God.

50
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,500
I was so just disappointed to hear the statistic

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,660
that Brianna shared that the average,

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,580
I'm not sure who they survey

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,539
when they come up with those statistics.

54
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,580
I wasn't called, I'm sure that many of you were not called,

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,679
but it's so frightening to me to think

56
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,919
that there would be any group of people

57
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,500
that would claim to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,419
and the average time spent in prayer to be two minutes.

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,220
That's sad.

60
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,339
There's a book that I was made aware of back in 1997,

61
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:58,339
and that book was on a very prominent display

62
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,660
in a Christian bookstore,

63
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,139
and that book was entitled

64
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,860
How to Pray in Nine Minutes and 59 Seconds,

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,940
and I thought how horrible of a title of a book that must be

66
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,940
that we're gonna try to squeeze God

67
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,539
into less than 10 minutes.

68
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:17,020
The reality is that now two minutes

69
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,100
is what this statistic is,

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,539
and yet the reality is that we can spend

71
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,720
as much time with God as we want.

72
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,059
What a privilege.

73
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:30,220
I'm so thankful that God doesn't say time's up, next.

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,339
We just enter into his presence,

75
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:34,779
bring our petitions before his throne.

76
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,820
As I look at this passage of scripture,

77
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
I've used the title from verse number five.

78
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,660
He had this testimony.

79
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,660
Look at what the Bible says in Hebrews 11 in verse five.

80
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,020
And by faith Enoch was translated

81
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,860
that he should not see death and was not found

82
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,860
because God had translated him for before his translation,

83
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,699
he, Enoch, had this testimony.

84
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,860
Notice that he pleased God.

85
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,699
I wonder this evening if someone were to summarize my life,

86
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,220
if someone were to summarize your life

87
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,899
with just one statement,

88
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,320
that's all they were allowed to have,

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,260
was one statement to summarize your life,

90
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,260
I wonder what it would be.

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,059
I wonder how somebody would summarize.

92
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm not asking how you would summarize your life.

93
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,420
I'm asking how someone else might summarize your life.

94
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,739
And then if we take it even a step further,

95
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,260
we can ask ourselves this question,

96
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,859
how would God summarize our lives?

97
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:45,779
Because here God is giving us a summary statement

98
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,899
of the life of Enoch.

99
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,940
We know the Bible says in the book of Genesis,

100
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
if you were to go back there,

101
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,500
we won't take the time to do so.

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,899
But Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him.

103
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,239
Huh, what an amazing testimony.

104
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,100
As I think about the summary statement

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
that's found here in our passage of scripture,

106
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,859
the Bible says he had this testimony,

107
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:10,700
four simple words that he pleased God.

108
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,859
We really could say it's three words, he pleased God.

109
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,579
Wow, what an incredible testimony.

110
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,299
These three words that are provided to us in Hebrews 11

111
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:25,820
in verse number five, he pleased God.

112
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,859
I believe that those three words, this testimony of Enoch,

113
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,859
those words are insightful.

114
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:35,220
They reveal to us something about Enoch's walk with God.

115
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,579
They reveal something to us about the seriousness of Enoch

116
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,899
seeking to please the Lord with his life

117
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,739
and having that single mindedness.

118
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,380
I think about Enoch and I think about us today,

119
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,000
how much we have that he did not have.

120
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,380
We have the whole Bible.

121
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,899
We have the Holy Spirit of God that indwells us.

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,200
And Enoch had this testimony, he pleased God.

123
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,140
Not only is the testimony that's given here

124
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,239
in Hebrews 11 in verse five insightful,

125
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,279
I believe it should be impactful to each of us

126
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,239
as we evaluate this testimony, as we ponder the thought

127
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:19,239
of what's really the full meaning of this statement

128
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:22,480
that he pleased God, that we too as a child of God,

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,519
that we would say that it would be our desire

130
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,440
that God would summarize our lives

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,880
with those same three words, that they pleased God,

132
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,519
that they pleased God.

133
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,920
See, this evening we must, as we look at the day and age

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,959
in which we live, we must avoid the temptation

135
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,720
to please ourselves.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,359
We live in a society that's pumping our minds full

137
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,779
of the idea that you just live your life

138
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,160
to please yourself and you do what makes you feel good

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,500
and you do what brings you that fulfillment.

140
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,640
That is not biblical, that is not having

141
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,320
a biblical worldview and we must avoid the temptation.

142
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,440
We find that there are those, in fact, Paul says this

143
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,279
in Philippians two, in verse number 21,

144
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,040
when he's speaking about sending Timothy

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,380
to the church in Philippi, he says of others,

146
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,579
he says the reason he's sending Timothy is because he knew

147
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,739
that Timothy was like-minded and would naturally care

148
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:25,440
for their estate, but he says for all seek their own

149
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,000
and not the things which are Jesus Christ.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,140
I think this evening that what Paul,

151
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,079
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

152
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,320
acknowledged to the believers in Philippi

153
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,679
of those that were seeking their own is certainly true

154
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,320
even in the day and age in which we live.

155
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,779
So many are just seeking to please themselves.

156
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,279
There's a danger in trying to please others.

157
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,579
People live their lives trying to please someone.

158
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,640
The only one that we should really desire to please is God.

159
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,559
And the reality is that if we walk with God

160
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,480
and we have that testimony that he pleased God,

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,480
then God's gonna take care of all the other things.

162
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,320
See, I'd rather have the testimony of Enoch

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,679
that he pleased God and maybe disappointed some other people

164
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,739
than to please some other people and disappoint God.

165
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,119
As I think about this testimony of Enoch

166
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:27,899
in these three simple words that he pleased God,

167
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,760
I wonder this evening how it could be said of you

168
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,119
and how it could be said of me that we would please God.

169
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:39,119
How could we live a life that's pleasing to God?

170
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,200
Have you ever had maybe an employer, a supervisor,

171
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,099
that you sought to please and found it

172
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,520
to be quite frustrating because you just didn't know

173
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,840
what you could do to please that person?

174
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,359
It didn't seem to matter from day to day,

175
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,919
things would shift and change

176
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,039
and maybe they had a shifting type of personality

177
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,320
and you did something yesterday that pleased them

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,239
but today it's not satisfactory

179
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,359
and it's frustrating and it just can be infuriating

180
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,520
because some people come to the end of themselves

181
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,320
and I just don't know what to do to please you.

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
People can feel that way.

183
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,359
Can I tell you this evening,

184
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,640
we don't ever have to feel that way with God.

185
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,919
You know why?

186
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,859
He's given us a full Bible and he's told us

187
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,159
within the pages of this wonderful book what pleases him

188
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,599
and he's told us those things that do not please him

189
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,000
and we ought to be thankful for that.

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,559
We ought to rejoice in knowing that God has given us

191
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,159
in his word the revelation of not only himself

192
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,799
but of those things that please him

193
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,159
so that we can take note as we study

194
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,880
through the pages of this book

195
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
and as we read and meditate upon the truth

196
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,960
that's contained therein and we find that these things

197
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,719
please God and these things displease God

198
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,599
that we can personally apply those things in our lives

199
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,440
so that why?

200
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,000
So that we can have that testimony that we please God.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
that we please God.

202
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:10,600
As I think about this testimony of Enoch, I am mindful of the Apostle Paul and his concern

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,000
for those that he had the opportunity to minister to, and this evening I just want to share

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,639
two thoughts with you with this idea of pleasing the Lord within the parameters, if you will,

205
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,440
of the ministry of the Apostle Paul.

206
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,319
Of course, God used Paul in a great way, and Paul is a man that desired to please the Lord.

207
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:31,399
We looked at Philippians 2.21, but in 1.21 he says, for me to live is Christ and to die

208
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,720
is gain.

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,279
And I think that summarizes a life testimony of the Apostle Paul that he was living his

210
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,240
life in such a way that his single focused desire was to please God.

211
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't think Paul was concerned about pleasing Peter.

212
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,799
I don't think Paul was concerned about pleasing Timothy or fill in the blank.

213
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,080
Paul was concerned about pleasing God, singularly.

214
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,840
As we understand the Apostle Paul in his own life and his ministry, God used him to

215
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,080
serve and minister a number of people.

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,319
Churches that were established through missionary journeys, churches that were contacted and

217
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:14,519
written to under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God so that they would grow in their

218
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,160
faith, and Paul, as we look at his writing and we look at his ministry and God gives

219
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,360
us a picture, a glimpse into the heart of Paul, I notice this evening within the context

220
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,199
of this subject matter of pleasing God, if you're taking notes, number one, I want you

221
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,480
to consider with me the concern of the Apostle Paul.

222
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
I want you to think about the Apostle Paul and his concern for those that God would give

223
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,220
him the opportunity to minister to.

224
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,959
Look over the book of Ephesians, if you will, and as we look at the book of Ephesians and

225
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:51,040
understand here what's taking place and looking at the ministry of the Apostle Paul and we

226
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,599
find here that Paul has this understanding that as he is writing to these and as he's

227
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:05,839
had the opportunity to minister to these individuals, that he speaks about hearing, receiving a

228
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,479
report with regard to their walk with God.

229
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,000
Now why is that important?

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Well Paul was praying for these believers.

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,520
Often you find in the letters that he writes that he's writing to them and he shares with

232
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,520
them how he's praying for them, but you also find that Paul is concerned on receiving a

233
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:31,479
report to know how they're doing, to understand how their walk with God is, how they've been

234
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:34,720
able to endure the attacks of the enemy.

235
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,080
When you look at the believers in Thessalonica, he deals with that specifically, and we find

236
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,000
that Paul, it's revealed to us his concern.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Notice with the believers in Ephesus, in Ephesians 1 and verse 15, the Bible says this,

238
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:55,639
Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints,

239
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,039
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, and then we find that

240
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,360
Paul begins to, and we're not gonna unwrap all of what he prays throughout the end of

241
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,600
the chapter, but we find that Paul specifically is saying I'm praying for you.

242
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,320
But when I think about the concern of the Apostle Paul, I want you to understand that

243
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,199
in the particular time, they don't have the technology that we have today, and Paul is

244
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,639
interested in receiving a report from these believers at Ephesus.

245
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,160
He wants to know how they're doing in their walk with God.

246
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,919
He wants to, he's interested, he's concerned to know if these believers at this church

247
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,360
in Ephesus that he was privileged, allowed of God to see planted and established, he

248
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,720
wants to know are they continuing in the faith, are they walking with God, are they

249
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,279
pleasing the Lord.

250
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,919
We find that Paul no doubt sends and he's interested in receiving words so that he can

251
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,720
hear this report.

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,279
We find in the book of Philippians that Paul is writing to this church, again that he had

253
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:05,399
the opportunity to be able to see established, and we find that Paul mentions even in the

254
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,440
first chapter again to the believers at Philippi in Philippians 1 and verse 27, notice what

255
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,919
he says, only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ, that whether

256
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,359
I come and see you or else be absent, notice what he says, I may hear of your affairs,

257
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:28,760
that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind, striving together for the faith of the

258
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,160
gospel.

259
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,679
Paul says, listen, whether I'm there or I cannot come, I desire to hear.

260
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,040
I want to receive this report, I want to be aware of the fact that you're serving and

261
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,279
pleasing the Lord.

262
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:47,399
As best we can tell, in the book of Colossians, Paul is writing to a group of people that

263
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,480
he never had the privilege of actually personally ministering to.

264
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,859
The church at Colossae is not a church that Paul had the privilege of starting and establishing,

265
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:03,640
but we find that Paul hears about their faith, he receives word about this group of believers

266
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,720
in the city of Colossae, and we find that Paul, when he heard about their walk with

267
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,600
God, it was encouraging to him, and he then sends a letter, yes, under the inspiration

268
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,519
of the Holy Spirit of God, but in that letter, he reveals to them how he's praying for them

269
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,480
that they would please God, that they would serve the Lord, that they would stand fast,

270
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,239
that they would continue in the faith.

271
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:32,799
Notice the Bible says in Colossians 1 and verse number 3, we give thanks to God and

272
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,359
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith

273
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:45,679
in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints, and we find that the

274
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,660
Apostle Paul, if you were to read verses 9 through 14, you can see the content really

275
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,079
of how he's praying for their growth.

276
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:01,559
Notice specifically in verse number 10, that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all

277
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,640
pleasing.

278
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,320
What's Paul's concern for these believers in Colossae?

279
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,640
That they would have the testimony that Enoch had, that they pleased God.

280
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,320
He's praying to that end, that they would walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.

281
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Notice it says, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.

282
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:34,000
It's a great study to study the prayers of the Apostle Paul, and then to take as we learn

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,359
how Paul prayed for believers, and to incorporate those same truths in our prayer lives.

284
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:47,399
So often, if we're not careful, our prayer time consists of more temporal things one

285
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,440
for another, than spiritual things.

286
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,720
And we find that as you would read the prayers of the Apostle Paul, as he's writing to these

287
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,040
believers, that they are full of spiritual truth.

288
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,959
He's praying for their spiritual growth.

289
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,600
He's praying here that they would be fruitful in every good work, as it's already been said

290
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,059
by our missionary and by Brianna during the testimony time.

291
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,720
We don't do good works to get saved or to stay saved.

292
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,959
As you study through the pages of God's precious Word, you find that salvation is a free gift.

293
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,440
He didn't just put a down payment on your salvation.

294
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,200
He paid for it all.

295
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,559
There's nothing you can do to earn or to keep your salvation.

296
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,519
We are kept by the power of God, and for that we must rejoice.

297
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:50,320
But we find that Paul is concerned that these believers in Ephesus, in Philippi, in Colossae,

298
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,959
that they would have this testimony that they pleased God.

299
00:17:54,959 --> 00:18:00,260
Notice in the book of 1 Thessalonians, I mentioned earlier how Paul is so concerned for this

300
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,160
group of believers.

301
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,720
It's interesting when you see the heart of the Apostle Paul here with the group of believers

302
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,399
in Thessalonica.

303
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,760
And you know that his time was short there in Thessalonica.

304
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,559
Those that were against him and the enemy, they ran him out of town very quickly.

305
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,959
But we find that in 1 Thessalonians 2, in verse number 12, notice the Bible says that

306
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:28,119
you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his kingdom and glory.

307
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,119
Think about that.

308
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,320
Again, pleasing God, that he pleased God, that's what it said of Enoch.

309
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,239
Here he says that they would walk worthy of God.

310
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:40,039
I do not think that it would be inappropriate to say that those terminologies could be used

311
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,039
synonymously.

312
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,080
That they'd walk worthy of God, that they would please God.

313
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,000
And we find here that Paul has that desire, he has that concern for these believers in

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Thessalonica.

315
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
In chapter 3, in verse number 1, it says,

316
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,719
Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone

317
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,520
and sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the gospel

318
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,119
of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

319
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,119
Why?

320
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,159
That no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves.

321
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,580
Know that we are appointed thereunto, for verily when we were with you, we told you

322
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,119
before that we should suffer tribulation, even as it has come to pass, and ye know.

323
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,119
For this cause.

324
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,119
Notice what Paul says.

325
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,320
When I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith.

326
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,520
And that's concern on the part of the spiritual leader, the apostle Paul.

327
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Why does Paul care?

328
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,880
Because he knows they're going to stand before Christ one day.

329
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,719
And he wants them to be able to have that testimony that they pleased God.

330
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:51,880
Did Paul have that desire himself?

331
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
Absolutely.

332
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,239
But Paul had that desire, that concern for those that God would enable him to minister

333
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,239
to.

334
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,919
He continues in verse number five and says,

335
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,079
Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labor be in vain

336
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,319
We have an enemy

337
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,559
We have an enemy and the Bible tells us the enemy is seeking whom he may devour

338
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,519
That's what the enemy is doing. He's active

339
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,999
And we find that Paul I love the language in verse number five when he says when I could no longer forbear

340
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:29,319
I mean Paul was in a position. He's like I just need to know

341
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:37,439
I need to know how they're doing. He's not concerned about a physical condition. He's concerned about their spiritual well-being

342
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,519
It's interesting to me that so often in our lives today

343
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:51,199
Even in our everyday conversation with brothers and sisters in Christ our conversation primarily consists of how are you doing?

344
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,799
temporally

345
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,999
It's

346
00:20:55,999 --> 00:21:02,079
Not very common that even a brother or sister in Christ has a conversation with another brother or sister in Christ

347
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,999
Hey, how are your devotions going? How's your time with God?

348
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,239
What are you reading? How's God working in your life?

349
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:17,839
Seems like those are questions that almost we act as if are off limits in conversations

350
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,119
Brethren, it ought not be the case. I

351
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,559
Remember in 2018 meeting a pastor that I'd never met before and

352
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,759
Kimberly, you know pastor Scotty Buckhouse

353
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,759
I think when your family was traveling you

354
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,919
Met him and I met him in 2018 never met them fella before my life brother Armando

355
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,319
We sat down at a big table and he sat across from me to eat lunch and I just met him. Hi, I'm Scotty

356
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,319
Hi, I'm Chris just met him

357
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,999
Sit down to eat lunch. We prayed and he said brother. How are your devotions? What's God teaching you in his word?

358
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,559
And I was excited by that. I

359
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,719
Was encouraged I wasn't offended by that and we had one of the best conversations

360
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,559
Talking about what God's teaching us in our own lives

361
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,039
It was awesome

362
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,039
But you know how rare that is

363
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:11,719
So rare, but Paul says I could no longer forbear

364
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:16,959
I just had to know how they were doing why because he's concerned that they're pleasing God

365
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,879
It wasn't concerned how they were doing financially how the job was going how this was going how that how are you doing spiritually?

366
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,399
How are you doing spiritually?

367
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,519
Not only do we see the concern of Paul

368
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,999
Quickly, we see the charge from Paul

369
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,799
Paul gives a charge to those that he's ministering to that aligns with his concern for them

370
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,039
and we find again as we look at some of these same passages scripture go back if you were to the book of

371
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,039
Ephesians in chapter 5

372
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,359
And notice what the Bible says

373
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,999
Ephesians 5 as we consider the charge of the Apostle Paul

374
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,519
Why would he say this to these believers that he's writing to these?

375
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,399
Saints at Ephesus, why would he say these things because he wants them to have the testimony that they please God

376
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,119
And he says to them in in Ephesians 5 and beginning in verse number one be therefore

377
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,159
followers of God as dear children follow the Lord and

378
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:21,599
Walk in love as Christ hath also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice of God for a

379
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,639
sweet-smelling

380
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:25,859
savor he then goes through a number of things to avoid and to

381
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:30,319
To not be partakers of and then he says this notice as we

382
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:38,119
Look at the the statement in verse number 10. He says proving what is acceptable unto the Lord

383
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,239
So what's he saying to these believers of Ephesus?

384
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,879
Listen you have a responsibility to prove

385
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,519
What is pleasing what is acceptable unto the Lord?

386
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,559
here are some things that you ought not do in fact as you look and you study here in the in the previous chapter in

387
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,239
Ephesians chapter before you find beginning in verse 17 down through the end

388
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:05,399
he talks about this principle that we see in the book of Colossians as well the put off put on principle and

389
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:13,279
Why is the Apostle Paul telling these believers in Ephesus to put off these things and to put on these things

390
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,519
Why is he telling them to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord for this purpose?

391
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,319
They please God

392
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,839
They please God

393
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:29,679
We read Colossians 1 10 already turn to the book of 1st Thessalonians and we'll look there very quickly

394
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,719
At what the Apostle Paul says to these that he needed to know their affairs he needed to know what was

395
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,199
Going on in their lives spiritually

396
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:45,239
We find that in 1st Thessalonians 2 in verse number 4

397
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:49,879
Notice what Paul says it's a great perspective that he had for ministry

398
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,719
He says but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel

399
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:58,959
Even so we speak not as pleasing men, but God which triath our hearts

400
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,519
so keeping in mind that Paul is sharing with them their his perspective of the

401
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,839
Privilege that they had that they were allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel

402
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,639
Even as we have been allowed of God to be entrusted with the gospel

403
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:15,719
But you notice that he says that he wanted to please God

404
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:21,199
He doesn't want to please men but look at chapter 4 in verse number 1 because he gives them a charge

405
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:26,739
It wasn't enough for the Apostle Paul to just have the personal desire that he would please God

406
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,319
But he wanted to give a charge to those that he was spiritually

407
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,359
Ministering to that they too would please the Lord notice in verse number 1 of chapter 4 furthermore

408
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,079
Then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus

409
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:48,799
That is he as he have received of us notice when he says how ye ought to walk and to please God

410
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,839
So you would abound more and more

411
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:57,039
What's his desire that they would please God

412
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:04,039
His charge to them is that they would live their lives in such a way that they would please the Lord

413
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:10,839
Let me close with this charge in 2nd Timothy. We're familiar with chapter 2 in verse number 2

414
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:17,519
When the Apostle Paul is giving this charge to Timothy his son in the faith and he speaks to him about

415
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,239
the importance of influence and generational influence

416
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:28,839
but we notice that in the same chapter that the Apostle Paul is is giving a charge to Timothy and even to

417
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:35,879
Us this evening and to all of those that God has enlisted into his army that we would please him notice in verse number 3

418
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:42,319
Of 2nd Timothy 2 the Bible says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ

419
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:49,719
No man that worth and tangle with himself with the affairs of this life notice that he may please him who hath chosen

420
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,039
Him to be a soldier

421
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,999
Paul says I want to give you this charge that you please God

422
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:03,479
Paul was concerned about the spiritual well-being of those that God enabled him to minister to and

423
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,039
Then he gives the charge

424
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,359
Live your life in such a way that you please the Lord

425
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,999
You know, we sang several songs today in fact about heaven kind of interesting how

426
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,079
that worked together and

427
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,479
We will see him one day face to face

428
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,759
What a wonderful wonderful Bible truth that is

429
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,559
But I wonder this evening if we'll hear that we pleased God

430
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,559
As

431
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,839
We think about how our life might be summarized

432
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:45,039
I think about the teenagers and being at camp and all of the the pressures that they have at the

433
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:47,159
time that they're in in life and

434
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,639
Do this and do that and chase this and do what makes you all of those things that they hear

435
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,719
I'm to please God

436
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,719
But it's not just teenagers

437
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,879
from the youngest to the oldest

438
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,799
To every child of God

439
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,519
It ought to be that our desire

440
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,519
Is to have the testimony?

441
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:16,279
That is said here of Enoch he had this testimony he pleased God

442
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,079
He pleased God

443
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,599
I'm not asking you to summarize your life. I'm not asking us to

444
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,119
Proclaim our own goodness

445
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:33,440
I'm saying as we evaluate. I've said this so often from this pulpit

446
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,279
Self-examination requires humility and honesty

447
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
It's easy for us to just say oh, yeah, I'm pleasing God

448
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,279
Take some time evaluate

449
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,519
Prove what is acceptable unto the Lord, you know proving is is a process

450
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:55,760
It was used that term in Ephesians 510 that's used with metal work

451
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,959
And you're proving those metals and you're you're heating them up to get the the impurities out and all that's taking place

452
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,320
and that's the term they would understand that and

453
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,239
God says to us proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. How do we do that?

454
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Compare scripture with scripture

455
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,959
Here's this thing that I'm thinking about doing or this okay

456
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:25,559
How does it please God does it not please God and I'm gonna prove what is acceptable unto the Lord. It's a process

457
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,839
It's work

458
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:31,679
But it's worth it. Why because we can have this testimony

459
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,839
They pleased God. I hope tonight as we think about this

460
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,760
simple statement in Hebrews 11 5

461
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,839
Absolutely, just captivate at my attention this week. I just couldn't get away from it and

462
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,799
I just wonder tonight

463
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,279
Do we really have a desire?

464
00:29:52,279 --> 00:30:00,000
That our lives are pleasing to God above everything else that it would be

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,719
be said of us that we have this testimony that we please God. Let's pray. Father, we

466
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:11,159
love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the testimony of Enoch. Thank you

467
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:21,920
for the complete canon of Scripture. You've given us truth. You've revealed to us those

468
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:29,200
things that please you. You've revealed to us those things that do not please you. God,

469
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:40,240
I pray that we'd have that desire that above all else we would please you. Help us, God,

470
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,520
to prove what is acceptable in the sight of God. I pray that as we have a moment of invitation

471
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,959
tonight, I pray, Lord, that you'd work in hearts and lives. Help us, Lord, to be honest

472
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:58,639
and humble. Help us, Lord, to truly seek to live our lives in such a way that it would

473
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,599
be a Philippians 121 for me to live as Christ, not a Philippians 221 that all seek their

474
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:12,319
own. I pray, God, that you would move and work as only you can. We'll thank you for

475
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,400
every decision. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
