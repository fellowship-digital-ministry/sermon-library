1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,219
chapter number 14, and we have been studying through the book of Genesis now for I don't

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,219
know how long.

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:12,439
I know this is lesson number 39 through the book of Genesis, and I'm very thankful for

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:19,040
the opportunity that God has given us to study this foundational book and how important the

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,959
first 11 chapters.

6
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:26,760
Of course, we know the whole of Scripture is of profit to us as the people of God and

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
is important.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
It's all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, but we find that it's those first

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,360
11 chapters of the book of Genesis that are under great attack in our world today and

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,720
laying that foundation, and I'm thankful for this great book that God has given us.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,279
As we come here to the 14th chapter, we find that there's been a period of time that has

12
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:55,799
passed from what we studied in the 13th chapter, and we find that God is giving us here a record

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,360
of this great military campaign that took place in the region.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,080
The battle that is described will take place in the Vale of Siddam, which is the Salt Sea,

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,599
according to verses 3 and 8, and we'll see as we get through the passage here how the

16
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,980
Lord is at work and what God is doing, of course, providing us with the historical aspect

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,519
of things, and we'll take special note also as to the life of Lot.

18
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,160
We mentioned last week some things about Lot that we found in Genesis chapter 13, and

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
we'll continue to reference those this evening.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,440
Notice with me in verse number 1 of Genesis 14.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
The Bible says,

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,120
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shanar, Ariok king of Elessar, Chedor

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,879
Laomer king of Elam, and Tadal king of nations, that these made war with Bera king of Sodom,

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:56,519
and with Bersha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shomerber king of Zeboiim, and

25
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,440
the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,959
All these were joined together in the Vale of Siddam, which is the Salt Sea.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,039
We'll continue reading as we go through the passage, but I want you to notice in verse

28
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,639
number 12, if you will, the Bible says,

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:21,399
And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

30
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:24,759
This evening, if you're taking notes, I'd like to preach a message that I've simply

31
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,679
entitled, And they took Lot.

32
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,380
And they took Lot.

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,919
For 12 years, as we begin to look at the passage of Scripture, we find that these kings served

34
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:43,479
Chedor Laomer, and they had the opportunity as they were serving, no doubt, he was benefiting

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:50,639
through their service, and it would seem with that particular time of era and history that

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,800
they probably paid taxes, and so on and so forth.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,440
And we do not have all of the details, God did not give us every detail, with regard

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,279
to this arrangement between these particular kings and these regions, but we find that

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
they served for 12 years.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,880
And then all of a sudden, in year number 13, they rebelled.

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,759
And perhaps, again, as we do not have all of the details, we do not know exactly what

42
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,279
led to their revolt or to their rebellion.

43
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:24,320
We don't know if it was a situation in which they felt that they had enough strength and

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,720
enough power now to resist whatever these kings and authorities and powers were imposing

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
upon them.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,199
We're done with paying these taxes, we don't need to do this anymore, we can rebel.

47
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,479
And that took place in year 13.

48
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,839
And we find that in year 14, the coalition comes and there is a battle that ensues.

49
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:52,279
As we look at the passage of Scripture, we find that the news of this rebellion was not

50
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:59,320
well received, and therefore, Chedor Laomer and his coalition, his confederacy, if you

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,000
will, they came in purpose to resolve the matter.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,960
It's interesting, if you look in verse number 4, it says, 12 years they served Chedor Laomer,

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,839
and in the 13th year, they rebelled.

54
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:19,600
And so, he didn't receive payments and whatever it was that was happening, and in year 14,

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,000
he's going to deal with it, according to verse number 5, and the 14th year came Chedor Laomer

56
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,440
and the kings that were with him.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,359
This confederacy that is mentioned in verse number 1, and we find that as they go, the

58
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:39,040
Bible says that they smote the Rephaims in Ashtaroth Cairneim, and the Zuzims in Ham,

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:47,320
and the Emims in Shavah Kirathim, excuse me, and the Horites in their Mount Seir, unto

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,119
El Peron, which is by the wilderness, verse 7, and they returned and came to En Mishpat,

61
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:59,480
which is Katish, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,600
dwelt in Hazazon Tamar.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,040
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah,

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,119
and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, the same as Zoar, and they joined battle with

65
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,079
them in the Vale of Sidhum.

66
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,399
We read all of these verses, and we see how God is setting the scene as to this battle

67
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,760
that's going to ensue, and we find that He lists out the kings and the side in which

68
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,040
they find themselves on, and these kings of the east, if you will, that there are four

69
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,519
of them, and they're going to battle against the king of Sodom and Gomorrah and their coalition,

70
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,880
and there are five of them.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,559
We see that in verse number 9.

72
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:44,119
It says, with Chedor Laomer, the king of Elam, and with Tidok, king of nations, and Amraphel,

73
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:50,959
king of Shinar, and Ariok, king of Elessar, four kings with five.

74
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,760
Now it would seem that the side that had the five kings, Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah,

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,399
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that they had the upper hand, if you will, from a human

76
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,399
perspective, for they, the four kings, were coming to travel into their territory.

77
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,959
And so they kind of had that home field advantage kind of thought, if you will.

78
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,559
They also had a greater number of people, it was five versus four as far as the kings

79
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:23,160
and their groups of people, but we find that when these, this coalition, this confederacy

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:31,640
led by Chedor Laomer, we find that they cleaned house, and they came into their territory

81
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,459
and they cleaned house, and there was a great victory on the part of this confederacy.

82
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:42,359
In fact, the Bible says in verse number 10, and the vale of Siddam was full of slime pits,

83
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:46,440
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there, and they that remained fled to

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
the mountain.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,799
Now, it's interesting, for the vale of Siddam, again, was their territory, no doubt they

86
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:57,760
were aware of the slime pits that were there, and yet they were the ones to fall victim

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,239
to that very thing that they were aware of.

88
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:06,600
And they find themselves in a very precarious situation, they come to this place where they're

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,000
in these slime pits, and then those that remained, the Bible says that they fled to

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the mountain.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,119
And I want you to notice what happens, and as it leads up to our discussion of Abraham,

92
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:24,640
and of course his name at this point is still Abram, and we begin to see how God is working

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,839
and how Abram gets involved here, and really we find what happens if you're taking notes

94
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,519
number one in verses 11 and 12, notice that Lot is captured in battle.

95
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,359
Lot is captured in battle.

96
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:43,720
The Bible says in verse number 11, and they, that coalition, the four kings, the confederacy

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,320
led by Chedorah Laomer, we find that they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah,

98
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,799
and all their vittles, and went their way.

99
00:07:54,799 --> 00:08:02,040
It continues in verse number 12 and says, and they took Lot, Abram's brother's son,

100
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,679
who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

101
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:12,760
As we begin to think about Lot, we think about how the Bible would reveal to us here this

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,600
battle and how the battle went, and the fact that, of course, Lot is now here referenced

103
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,399
and that he was taken in verse number 12, but really these kings, they had great victory.

104
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,140
The Bible says that they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah.

105
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,419
They went in and they took everything.

106
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,739
The Bible tells us that they took all the vittles and they went their way.

107
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:42,419
They came in and they took everything, and then the Bible specifically makes mention

108
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,419
about Lot.

109
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,419
Why?

110
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:49,739
Because we see how that's going to play into Abram becoming involved in this particular

111
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,140
situation.

112
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,580
And we find that the Bible tells us that they not only took Lot, but they tells us that

113
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,299
they took his goods and they departed.

114
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,059
I want you to notice what the Bible says in verse number 12.

115
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:11,820
In the middle of the verse, it says this of Lot, who dwelt in Sodom.

116
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,020
We go back to chapter number 13, and I made reference of this in our previous study, but

117
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,020
in chapter number 13, we find that there was a difficulty that was being dealt with.

118
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,099
There was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.

119
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:31,780
We find that Abram, of course, he dealt with that situation with wisdom, and we find that

120
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,859
he gave the choice to Lot, and Lot, according to verse number 10, lifted up his eyes and

121
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:42,179
beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed

122
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:47,099
Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou

123
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,880
comest unto Zoar.

124
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
So Lot chose that.

125
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,539
It says in verse 11, then Lot chose him, all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east,

126
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,080
and they separated themselves, the one from the other, and it says this, Abram dwelt...

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
dwelt in the land of Canaan,

128
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,620
and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain,

129
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,400
notice, and pitched his tent toward Sodom."

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
He was not in Sodom,

131
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,000
but he had pitched his tent toward Sodom.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,120
Now it's interesting,

133
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,300
for in verse 13,

134
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,280
God gives us some insight

135
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,880
as to the character and the behavior

136
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,680
of these that inhabited Sodom.

137
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,220
It says this in verse 13,

138
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,340
"'But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners

139
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,340
before the Lord exceedingly.'"

140
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,220
That's a pretty interesting description

141
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,100
that God gives us of the inhabitants of Sodom.

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,460
And we find that Lot made this decision

143
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,740
and he pitches his tent

144
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,780
and he's looking toward Sodom.

145
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,540
It would not be long.

146
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,580
We find that now as we come to the 14th chapter,

147
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,460
we do not know exactly how much time has passed

148
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,140
between these two events that are recorded here,

149
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,300
but we now find that Lot is dwelling in Sodom.

150
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,220
We know as we study the Scriptures,

151
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,940
as we read through the book of Genesis,

152
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,660
if you've been around the Word of God

153
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,860
for any length of time,

154
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,420
you understand that before long,

155
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,780
Lot will be at the city gate.

156
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,820
In chapter 19, we read of that.

157
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,860
We read of the way in which Sodom

158
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,300
no doubt got the hearts of his children

159
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,100
and you think all that takes place

160
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,820
and of course, the way in which God

161
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,220
would destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.

162
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,660
We'll get to that in several weeks

163
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,980
as we make our way through the book of Genesis,

164
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,300
but I want you to consider with me this evening

165
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,540
that Lot made this decision

166
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,020
to pitch his tent toward Sodom

167
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,700
and before long, he was living in Sodom.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,940
And we need to be very careful

169
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,300
that we learn a life lesson

170
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,660
from this very truth with regard to Lot.

171
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,420
Listen, the devil, he wants you.

172
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,580
He's gonna try to do whatever he can

173
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,140
to corrupt you and to destroy your testimony

174
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,700
and he just wants to desensitize you to some things.

175
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,580
He wants you to get comfortable with some things

176
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,340
and before long, if we look at it long enough,

177
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,060
if we are exposed to it long enough,

178
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,780
we have this thing that we get desensitized to it.

179
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,020
And before long, we become okay with certain things

180
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,020
that perhaps earlier on in our walk with God

181
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,620
we would not have been okay with.

182
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,500
And maybe we make some excuses.

183
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,860
Well, you know, everybody's doing it.

184
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,460
Well, it's just kind of the accepted thing.

185
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,700
I mean, we can think about our nation.

186
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,820
You see the wickedness that goes on in our society

187
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,540
and the way in which we,

188
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,380
if we would like to take and stand upon the truth

189
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,500
of the Word of God,

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,180
that there are many that would criticize

191
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,980
the fact that we would simply desire

192
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,580
to take a biblical position

193
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,340
on the social issues of the day.

194
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,020
Why? Because so many have just gotten desensitized to it.

195
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,140
They say, well, that's just normal.

196
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,220
No, it's not normal.

197
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,420
It's wicked.

198
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,900
And we find that Lot got himself in a position

199
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,020
where he faced Sodom long enough

200
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,660
that now he's okay living in Sodom.

201
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,700
And that's terrible.

202
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,820
And by the way, we find that because Lot lived in Sodom,

203
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,980
he now is taken captive.

204
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,500
And we find that he is captured in battle.

205
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,580
As we continue moving through the text of Scripture

206
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,220
and we look at verses 13 and 14,

207
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,180
we see that Abram, number two,

208
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,860
Abram prepares for battle.

209
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,500
Lot is captured in battle

210
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,900
and now Abram will prepare for battle.

211
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,740
The Bible tells us this in verse number 13.

212
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,340
And there came one that had escaped

213
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,460
and told Abram, notice this, the Hebrew.

214
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,260
This is the first mention of the word Hebrew

215
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,580
in all of the Bible.

216
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,780
You find that Abram is referred to as a Hebrew.

217
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
It really carries with it the idea

218
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,420
of being one that is a stranger or pilgrim.

219
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,980
Isn't that interesting when you read

220
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,660
Hebrews chapter number 11?

221
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,220
And I know that it was just our study last Sunday morning,

222
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,900
but let me just go back and read it just for a moment.

223
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,180
We find that this in Hebrews in chapter number 11,

224
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,940
in verse number 13, speaking of Abraham,

225
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,660
it says, these all died in faith,

226
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,380
not having received the promises,

227
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,260
but having seen them afar off

228
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,580
and were persuaded of them and embraced them

229
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,180
and confessed that they were strangers

230
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,300
and pilgrims on the earth.

231
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,860
For they that say such things

232
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,340
declare plainly that they seek a country

233
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,740
and truly if they had been mindful of that country

234
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,020
from whence they came out,

235
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,140
they might have had opportunity to have returned,

236
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,740
but verse 16 says this,

237
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,420
but now they desire a better country

238
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,740
that is in heavenly,

239
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,580
wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God,

240
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,420
for He hath prepared for them a city.

241
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,780
Pilgrims and strangers.

242
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,540
I said this last Sunday morning,

243
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,500
that we're away from home,

244
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,900
but we're going home.

245
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,380
And as the people of God,

246
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,300
we understand this evening

247
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,020
that we are citizens of heaven.

248
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,300
If you've been born again,

249
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,180
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior,

250
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,660
you have citizenship in heaven.

251
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,420
This world is not my home.

252
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,980
I'm just a passing through

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,500
is what the old songwriter said.

254
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,380
And what a joy to know

255
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,580
that we are just pilgrims and strangers upon this earth.

256
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,220
It's not all that there is to have

257
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,180
and how grateful I am for that truth.

258
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,300
We find that it says that there came one

259
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,260
that escaped and told Abram the Hebrew

260
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,980
back in Genesis 14.

261
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,420
In verse number 13, it says,

262
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,500
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre in the Amorite,

263
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,740
brother of Eshcol, the brother of Einar.

264
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,020
And these were confederate with Abram.

265
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,260
So they understood some things about Abraham,

266
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
about Abram.

267
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,700
We find that as we had studied

268
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,100
the latter part of chapter number 13,

269
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,340
that as we followed the steps of Abram,

270
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,460
that the Bible says that then Abram in verse number 18,

271
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,540
removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre.

272
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,740
And as we began talking about that last week,

273
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,620
it really carries with it the idea

274
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,600
is that as he was moving through the land of promise,

275
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,580
he would move his tent, he moved to another place,

276
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,180
and he'd moved to another place.

277
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,580
He was a stranger, a pilgrim.

278
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,020
And we understand that.

279
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,820
We mentioned in fact, last Sunday morning,

280
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,580
as we studied the passage in Hebrews chapter number 11,

281
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,500
that Abraham had been given a promise.

282
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,220
It was a promise of a land and a seed.

283
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,020
And we find that when he died,

284
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,200
there was no land that he possessed.

285
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Save a plot of land for his wife that he buried.

286
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,420
But yet he had been given a promise.

287
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,620
We find here that these that dwelt in the land

288
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,380
that they knew, and they even referred to him

289
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,100
as the Hebrew.

290
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,300
We find that it says in verse number 14,

291
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,180
when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive,

292
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,860
he received the news.

293
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,820
He was informed of what had taken place.

294
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,300
No doubt with the size of these armies

295
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,300
and the battle that ensued there in the Vale of Siddam,

296
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,100
no doubt there was some level of awareness

297
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,840
that Abram would have as to what was going on.

298
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,000
But now he receives the news that his brother,

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,440
as it says his brother, his nephew,

300
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,040
we understand his brother was taken captive.

301
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,920
It says this, that he armed his trained servants,

302
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,720
born in his own house, 318,

303
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,280
and pursued them unto Dan.

304
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,920
Abram said, we got to take care of this.

305
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,960
And he prepared for battle.

306
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,880
He understood that there was work to be done.

307
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,120
We see the way in which God had blessed Abram.

308
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
We have mentioned throughout our study

309
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,160
as we entered into the latter part of the 11th chapter

310
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
of the book of Genesis,

311
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,560
how that God begins to focus squarely

312
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,440
and specifically upon Abram and upon his line.

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,000
And we understand that God had promised to bless

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,780
and God was blessing 318 trained servants

315
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,560
that were born in his own house.

316
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,280
And he prepares these.

317
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,400
The Bible says that they pursued them unto Dan.

318
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,880
And so the Bible tells us in verses three and eight

319
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,520
about the Vale of Sidon, which is the Salt Sea.

320
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,400
And we find that as you would begin to look

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,920
at the geography of the area,

322
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,520
that they would have traveled north westward

323
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,160
as they would seek after this coalition,

324
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,920
this confederacy that had been successful

325
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,280
on defeating these five kings and their peoples

326
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
and taking Lot and all his goods,

327
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,679
he's now pursuing them.

328
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,000
We find that Abram not only prepared for battle,

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,080
but as we continue looking at the passage of Scripture,

330
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,360
we see that Abram is victorious in battle.

331
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
He's victorious in battle.

332
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,960
We see his approach is given to us in verse number 15,

333
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,520
where the Bible says that he divided himself against them,

334
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
he and his servants by night.

335
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,559
We find that he divided his forces

336
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,200
and sought to attack at night.

337
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,200
You think about the power of this coalition as they came in

338
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
and what they were able to successfully do.

339
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,880
And now Abram is going to do battle against them.

340
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,119
And we find that no doubt in my mind,

341
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,760
God has given Abram wisdom and direction

342
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
as to the direction to take

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
with attacking this group of people.

344
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,360
The Bible says, as you look in verse 15,

345
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,200
and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah,

346
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,880
which is on the left hand of Damascus.

347
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,799
So you find that there was victory,

348
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,400
that Abram prepared for battle,

349
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,239
but then Abram was victorious in battle.

350
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:50,360
We find that the Bible tells us that he smote them

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,720
and he pursued them.

352
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,600
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 16,

353
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,320
as we think about the return after smiting them

354
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,920
and after having this victory,

355
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,620
we get the insight that it was a complete victory.

356
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,500
The Bible tells us in v. 16,

357
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,580
and he, Abram, brought back all the goods

358
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,740
and also brought again his brother-in-law

359
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,280
and his goods,

360
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,940
and the women also,

361
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,440
and the people.

362
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,620
You look at the victory here in v. 16

363
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,580
and you see how that Abram

364
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,000
was enabled by God to go against this coalition,

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,540
this force that had come in

366
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,580
and had conquered these five kings

367
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,720
and their people.

368
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,680
And we find that God had given victory

369
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,960
and He was able to go and to return

370
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
all of the goods and all of the people.

371
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
In fact, as we begin to look at the passage

372
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,720
and see the victory that is recorded

373
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,400
on this particular day,

374
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,480
and to consider the significance

375
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,080
of this victory,

376
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,240
we would find that in v. 22,

377
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,000
and though we'll study the latter part

378
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
of chapter 14 next Sunday evening

379
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,940
as we get into the situation

380
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,060
with Melchizedek,

381
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,720
I do want to draw your attention

382
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,320
to v. 22.

383
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,400
I believe that it reveals to us

384
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,160
some very important insight.

385
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,960
Abram said to the king of Sodom,

386
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
the king of Sodom comes to meet with Abram

387
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,720
according to v. 17,

388
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,560
and he speaks to him in v. 21,

389
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,920
and as Abram would respond to the king of Sodom

390
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
in v. 22,

391
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,520
I want you to notice what Abram says.

392
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,180
He says,

393
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,080
I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord,

394
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,120
the Most High God,

395
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,840
the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

396
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,360
Abram knew some things about God.

397
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,880
God had revealed Himself to Abram.

398
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,520
We understand all the way back

399
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,520
when God placed that call on the life of Abram

400
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
when he was still in the Ur of the Chaldees

401
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,960
where there was still that false idol worship

402
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,120
that was taking place

403
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
that God revealed Himself to Abram

404
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,480
and God called Abram,

405
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,120
and now Abram is standing before the king of Sodom

406
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,000
who is now having this conversation with him,

407
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,320
and Abram reveals to him

408
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
that he had lifted up his hand unto the Lord,

409
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,320
and he says that he is the Most High God.

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,560
He is the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

411
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,680
Isn't that refreshing to understand this evening?

412
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,320
That we serve the Lord God Almighty.

413
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,800
It's interesting to note that in chapter 15

414
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,080
in verse 1,

415
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,400
that after these things,

416
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
the Word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,

417
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,680
notice what God tells Abram.

418
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,200
He says,

419
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,880
Fear not, Abram.

420
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,520
I am thy shield

421
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,360
and thy exceeding great reward.

422
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,200
We find that in this particular context

423
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
of all that had happened,

424
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,480
as Abram would go and defeat this coalition

425
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,800
and bring back the spoils and the people,

426
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,440
that there could be the thought

427
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,320
that they're going to regroup

428
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
and they're going to come after Abram.

429
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,520
And God says,

430
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't be afraid.

431
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm your shield.

432
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm your great reward.

433
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,720
As we begin to think about this passage of Scripture

434
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,560
and this historical record that is given to us,

435
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,040
and we find that God has given us

436
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
the historical record

437
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,880
so that we'd understand this event as it's happened,

438
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,280
but I wonder this evening

439
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
as we begin to think about some lessons,

440
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,080
some applications for us,

441
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,480
of course, first and foremost,

442
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,120
we see that application

443
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,840
with regard to the life of Lot.

444
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,600
We need to be careful.

445
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
We need to be careful

446
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
that we do not listen.

447
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,720
The devil is sly.

448
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,800
He is subtle.

449
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,480
He doesn't care how long it takes

450
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,840
to get you into Sodom.

451
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,120
He's not going to try to get you into Sodom tomorrow.

452
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,080
He feels like he's got time on his side.

453
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Honestly.

454
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Some of these young people need to understand that

455
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,000
from some of the older people.

456
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Amen?

457
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Because the devil just a little bit,

458
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,080
a little bit,

459
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,680
a little bit,

460
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
just kind of desensitizes you just a moment.

461
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,560
We use the analogy about the frog

462
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,600
in the pot of water, right?

463
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
And that analogy, it's as old as the hills.

464
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,960
People have been using that for as long as I know, right?

465
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,920
But the reality is that that's how Satan works.

466
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,080
He's just trying to incrementally desensitize you

467
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,400
to wickedness

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,640
and bring you to a place where you're okay with it.

469
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,080
That what we once stood against,

470
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,120
we now tolerate.

471
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,040
What we once tolerated, we now accept.

472
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
It's just the progress.

473
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,760
It's just the way it works.

474
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,480
We can look at the history of our nation.

475
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
We can look at the history of others.

476
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,080
We see it.

477
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,640
We can look in the lives of individuals.

478
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
We can look in the history of churches

479
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
and we can see how there were churches

480
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,320
that stood for certain things 40, 50 years ago

481
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,880
that all of a sudden don't stand

482
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,480
for those same things today.

483
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,920
They've allowed some things to come into the church.

484
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,560
They've desensitized.

485
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
They've allowed some things to come into the church

486
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
that are not in the church today.

487
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,840
Listen, God's not changed.

488
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,520
He's still holy.

489
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,840
Amen?

490
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,320
He still said, come out from among them and be separate.

491
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
I told you months ago, I've not preached it yet,

492
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,720
but I'm working on it.

493
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,120
This whole thing about social distancing,

494
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm preaching a message on spiritual distancing.

495
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,120
Man, we need it.

496
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,960
And I'm just waiting for God to say,

497
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,800
we're just getting desensitized.

498
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,960
We take no of lot.

499
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,520
He pitched His tent towards Sodom.

500
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,920
He's now dwelling in Sodom.

501
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,480
We notice the lesson from the life of Abram.

502
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,160
We know that here in this passage of Scripture,

503
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,880
we're talking about a physical war that takes place.

504
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,080
A physical battle.

505
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,280
And we understand as the people of God today,

506
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,640
as we look at New Testament Christianity,

507
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,600
that we understand that we're not engaged

508
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,280
in a carnal warfare.

509
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,080
We're not engaged in a wrestling against flesh and blood.

510
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,280
We're engaged in a spiritual battle.

511
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,120
And we take the example of Abram

512
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,720
and how that he was trusting in the Lord God Almighty,

513
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,840
the Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.

514
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,040
We've this year had our theme as I will,

515
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,120
looking unto Jesus.

516
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,680
And we've been singing that song from Psalm 121,

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,120
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.

518
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,520
From whence cometh my help?

519
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,960
My help cometh from the Lord,

520
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,040
which made Heaven and Earth.

521
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,200
He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things.

522
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
But we understand that as we're engaged

523
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,600
in this spiritual battle that we need

524
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,760
to go in the power of God.

525
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,480
We cannot win this battle in our own power.

526
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Abram must have been dependent upon the Lord

527
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,560
in order to have the victory that is recorded

528
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,400
here in Genesis 14.

529
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,840
And this evening if we're going to be victorious

530
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,200
in this spiritual battle that we're engaged in,

531
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,960
we must be dependent upon the Lord.

532
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,760
Take your Bibles and turn to Ephesians 6 if you will,

533
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,040
and as you're turning there,

534
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,560
I'll read to you a verse of Scripture

535
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,040
from 1 Corinthians 15.

536
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,080
It's a verse that we're familiar with in verse 57

537
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,920
when Paul says,

538
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,360
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

539
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,320
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

540
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,760
We sang this morning, Victory in Jesus.

541
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,960
It's a great song, is it not?

542
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,600
And what a joy to sing about the victory

543
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
that we can have in Christ

544
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,280
and we find that we can be victorious,

545
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,920
that we are more than conquerors.

546
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
Here in the book of Ephesians,

547
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
God begins to inform the church at Ephesus

548
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,880
about this battle that they're engaged in.

549
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,520
Of course, the Apostle Paul,

550
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,360
as he would be the human penman of this particular book,

551
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,560
he'd already met with the Ephesian elders.

552
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,000
It's recorded back in Acts 20.

553
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And if you go back and read Acts 20,

554
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,880
you'll take note that Paul warns them

555
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
that there are going to be some wolves

556
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,320
that come in after his departure.

557
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
He warned them of those things.

558
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,160
And we find here that as we look at this,

559
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,680
if you want to jot down the exact text of Scripture,

560
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,640
it's Acts 20 and verse 29.

561
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,780
He says, for I know this,

562
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,900
that after my departing shall grievous wolves

563
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,260
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

564
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,740
He's trying to help them to understand

565
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,140
this thing of spiritual warfare.

566
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,060
And as he would be writing this last chapter

567
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,340
as we have in our Bibles,

568
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,740
this last section of Ephesians,

569
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,220
we come to verse number 10 of chapter number 6.

570
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,600
And he says, finally, my brethren,

571
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.

572
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Put on the whole armor of God.

573
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,820
Why?

574
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,060
That you may be able to stand

575
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,940
against the wiles of the devil.

576
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,260
The deceitfulness, the craftiness, the trickery.

577
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,420
By the way, I hope you'll be back next Sunday evening

578
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,380
because as you look at the last part of chapter number 14,

579
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,460
you see how the king of Sodom comes

580
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,700
and tries to offer Abram some things.

581
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,620
It's just like the enemy.

582
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,660
It really goes well with what I preached this morning

583
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,220
of living by faith, the last section there

584
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,740
that we looked at in Hebrews 11,

585
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,860
dealing with Moses and all of that,

586
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,800
and all that the king of Sodom would offer.

587
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,140
I'm so thankful that Melchizedek showed up

588
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,820
and spoke with Abram before the king of Sodom did.

589
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,560
But that will be next week.

590
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,840
Notice, in verse number 12 of Ephesians 6,

591
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,680
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

592
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,580
but against principalities, against powers,

593
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,140
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

594
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,780
against spiritual wickedness in high places."

595
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,880
This spiritual battle that we're engaged in,

596
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,520
this spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

597
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,400
We find that this evening

598
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,200
as we even go through our lives

599
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,780
and begin to examine the things

600
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,180
that are going on around us,

601
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,820
we must be aware of the spiritual aspect of it.

602
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,260
We must be aware of the fact

603
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,340
that there's spiritual battle that's taking place.

604
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,620
And we find that there is an enemy

605
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,460
and his name is Satan, the devil,

606
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,300
the old deceiver, that serpent.

607
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,980
And he seeks to destroy and devour

608
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,780
anything that God is for.

609
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,140
We find that one day, that old serpent,

610
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,020
according to Revelation 20,

611
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,660
he's going to be cast in the lake of fire

612
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,620
and he's going to be tormented day and night

613
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,180
forever and ever.

614
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
Amen?

615
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,180
That's what the Bible tells us.

616
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,460
And we find here that as we're engaged

617
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,860
in this spiritual warfare,

618
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,100
this spiritual battle,

619
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,460
that we understand that our enemy

620
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,780
is ruthless and relentless.

621
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,700
The reality is that the Bible tells us

622
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,020
as Peter would say in 1 Peter 5,

623
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,260
that we're to be sober, be vigilant,

624
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,180
because your adversary is a roaring lion

625
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:31,180
that walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

626
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,300
He's got nothing good for you or me.

627
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,660
So God gives us the instructions.

628
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,060
Verse 13 of Ephesians 6,

629
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,380
Wherefore, take unto you,

630
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,100
again, you see it, the whole armor of God,

631
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,660
that you may be able to withstand

632
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,900
in the evil day,

633
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,020
and having done all, to stand.

634
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,780
Stand therefore,

635
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,740
having your loins girt about with truth.

636
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,460
Sanctify them through thy truth.

637
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,220
Thy Word is truth.

638
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,820
I'm so thankful for the Word of God.

639
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,940
I'm so thankful that God has given us truth.

640
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm thankful for the power of truth.

641
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,980
By the way, you just stand on truth.

642
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,180
And you just proclaim truth.

643
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,340
We find that it says,

644
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,380
and having on the breastplate of righteousness,

645
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,300
your feet shod with the preparation

646
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,180
of the Gospel of peace,

647
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,260
above all, taking the shield of faith,

648
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,060
wherewith ye shall be able to quench,

649
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,500
notice, all the fiery darts of the wicked.

650
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,900
Take the helmet of salvation

651
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,100
and the sword of the Spirit,

652
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,540
which is the Word of God.

653
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,500
Praying always with all prayer and supplication

654
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,300
in the Spirit,

655
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,860
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

656
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,140
and supplication for all saints.

657
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,780
Paul then makes specific prayer requests

658
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,540
for himself in verses 19 and 20.

659
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
But as we look at the passage of Scripture,

660
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,380
and we're mindful this evening

661
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,900
of this physical battle that took place

662
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,940
in Genesis 14,

663
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,740
and we see the way in which

664
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,100
Abram prepared for battle.

665
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,460
And he prepared for battle

666
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
because it was a physical battle.

667
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,980
And he went forth with his trained servants

668
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,340
and he dealt with what he had to deal with.

669
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,700
But as New Testament believers,

670
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,620
as we understand that we are engaged

671
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,420
in a different kind of battle,

672
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,540
nonetheless, we're still engaged in battle.

673
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Then we take the truth of the Word of God

674
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,620
and we say we need to be prepared for the battle.

675
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,980
Every day when we leave our homes,

676
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,260
when we go out into this world,

677
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,380
we understand that we're entering the battlefield.

678
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,300
And I would submit to you this evening

679
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,740
that if you think about it in that way,

680
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,500
it will change your perspective.

681
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,180
Because when you leave and you enter out there

682
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,820
and you're aware of the fact

683
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,020
that you're engaging in spiritual battle

684
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,340
and that you're entering the battlefield,

685
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,100
you're going to take certain precautions.

686
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,540
You're going to do certain things.

687
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:09,020
If you just live just another day,

688
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,740
I'm going out, pie in the sky,

689
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,980
everything's great, so on and so forth,

690
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,020
you're unaware of the battle that's taking place.

691
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,660
You can very easily become a casualty.

692
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,260
I've never served in the military,

693
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,100
but you know that I grew up

694
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,700
and my dad was in the Marine Corps

695
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,620
all of my life when I was at home.

696
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,780
When I was born, he was in.

697
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,820
When I went to college, he was in.

698
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,780
My brother served, so I was around military quite a bit.

699
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,380
If you tell those guys to prepare for battle,

700
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,460
there's a certain number of things

701
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,220
that they're going to do.

702
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,060
They've been trained.

703
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,260
They've gone through the process.

704
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,180
And they're going to take those items that they need.

705
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,940
Spiritually speaking, we've been given

706
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,300
some instruction in the Word of God.

707
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,900
Oh, that God would help us

708
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,220
to be aware of this battle that we're engaged in.

709
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,340
And that we would be prepared.

710
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,060
That we would be dependent upon our God.

711
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,940
And that we'd understand that victory

712
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,420
is possible through the Lord Jesus Christ.

713
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,020
Listen, Paul says this to conclude

714
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,340
with this passage of Scripture

715
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,460
over in 2 Corinthians 10.

716
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,660
Again, dealing with the subject matter

717
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,340
of this warfare that we're engaged in.

718
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,980
And we understand that here,

719
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,700
Paul is seeking to encourage this church in Corinth.

720
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,020
And he gives them this important truth

721
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,900
in verse number three of chapter 10.

722
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,620
2 Corinthians 10 and verse three.

723
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,220
For though we walk in the flesh,

724
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,540
notice, we do not war after the flesh.

725
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,340
For the weapons of our warfare

726
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,200
are not carnal, but mighty through God

727
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,840
to the pulling down of strongholds.

728
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,280
They're mighty through God

729
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,840
to the pulling down of strongholds.

730
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,720
We find the instruction in verse five,

731
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,000
casting down imaginations

732
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and every high thing that exalted itself

733
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,160
against the knowledge of God

734
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,680
and bring into captivity every thought

735
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,200
to the obedience of Christ.

736
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,720
And we find this evening

737
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,040
that Abram was victorious in battle

738
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,960
back in Genesis chapter 14.

739
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,600
We see that Lot was captured in battle.

740
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,480
Abram prepares for battle,

741
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,160
but then the fact that Abram was victorious in battle.

742
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,240
And he details there as he's speaking

743
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,840
to the king of Sodom,

744
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,400
he reveals that he was dependent upon the Lord,

745
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,400
the Most High God, the Possessor of Heaven and Earth

746
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,080
this evening.

747
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,480
Do you want to be victorious?

748
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,480
In the battle that we're engaged in,

749
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,640
in the spiritual warfare that we're engaged in,

750
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,700
we better take heed to Ephesians 6, verses 10 through 17.

751
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,960
And every day we better put on the whole armor of God

752
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,920
so that we can go in the power of God,

753
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,200
not in our own power,

754
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,680
that we be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

755
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,760
But thanks be to God,

756
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

757
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,720
I hope this evening that as we look

758
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,760
at a passage of scripture from Genesis 14,

759
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,680
that we not only learn some history

760
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,720
of this particular account and what took place,

761
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,200
but that we can learn the application,

762
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,520
one valuable life lesson from Lot

763
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,480
and another valuable life lesson from Abram.

764
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Next week, we'll study the latter part of Genesis 14

765
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,960
and we'll look at this great interaction

766
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,560
with Abram and Melchizedek.

767
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,420
If you've been with us through Sunday mornings

768
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,600
as we studied the book of Hebrews,

769
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,720
of course, there was much discussion

770
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
on the subject matter of Melchizedek.

771
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,000
And I look forward to sharing that

772
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,740
with you next Sunday evening.

773
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,760
Let's go to the Lord in prayer.

774
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,640
Father, we love you.

775
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
We thank you for loving us.

776
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,840
We thank you for the privilege

777
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,480
of being able to gather together once again this evening.

778
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,880
We thank you for the record that is given to us

779
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,300
here in Genesis 14.

780
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,000
And Lord, we thank you for the valuable life lessons

781
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,520
that we can take and apply in our lives.

782
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,220
I pray, Father, that you would help us

783
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,740
to learn these lessons.

784
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,460
God, that you would help us to stand upon truth.

785
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,740
Help us to understand the tactics of our enemy.

786
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:25,660
You'd like to desensitize us to wickedness, immorality.

787
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,140
Lord, I pray that we would stand upon the truth of your Word.

788
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,700
Help us to learn this lesson from the life of Abram

789
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,660
that we would be dependent upon you,

790
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,900
that we'd recognize that we're engaged in battle,

791
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,580
but that we must be strong in the Lord

792
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,900
and the power of his might to put on the whole armor of God.

793
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,460
I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can.

794
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,940
I pray, God, that we'd respond to you this evening.

795
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,780
Perhaps there's a particular area in our lives

796
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,780
in which you have pinpointed.

797
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,540
You've sought to encourage us.

798
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,660
You've sought to challenge us and to convict us.

799
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,540
I pray, God, that you'd have your will and way

800
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,420
in these next few moments.

801
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,740
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

802
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,660
Would you stand with me?

803
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,100
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
