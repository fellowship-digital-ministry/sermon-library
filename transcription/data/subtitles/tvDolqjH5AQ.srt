1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
Verses 5 through 10, 1 John 1, verses 5 through 10 on the back of your bulletin this morning,

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,239
you see that the title for the message is, God is light.

3
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,239
God is light.

4
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:14,920
We see that in verse number 5, this then is the message which we have heard of him and

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,680
declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:30,799
We find that here, the note again, the consistency in which John communicates with those that

7
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:35,479
he's writing to, of course, for us by way of preservation, the source of his message.

8
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,000
You'll remember at the beginning of verse number 3, it says that which we have seen

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,080
and heard declare we unto you.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,080
And then here in verse number 5, to begin that verse, he says, this then is the message

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,159
that we have heard of him and declare unto you.

12
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,240
Of course, John had the privilege of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,279
ministry and what a tremendous blessing that was.

14
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:03,919
And we find that as John is now under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, writing

15
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:08,599
to these recipients in the first century, and of course, by preservation for us, he's

16
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,559
helping us to understand that this is the message which we've heard of him and declare

17
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:13,559
unto you.

18
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:14,559
What is that message?

19
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:18,400
That God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,919
In fact, it reminds us of what we read in John chapter number 1.

21
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,760
Hold your place here in 1 John.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,879
In turn of the gospel of John, if you will, in John chapter number 1, and you know in

23
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,959
the gospel of John, we mentioned last week how that there's great similarity between

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:41,360
the opening of John, the gospel of John, and the epistle, 1 John, with regard to just getting

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
right at it.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,879
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and just

27
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,760
right out of the chute, a hundred miles an hour, if you will, and just proving the deity

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,599
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,239
We find that now in verse number 5, he begins to deal with the subject of light, just as

30
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,720
he does in 1 John chapter number 1 and verse number 5 as well.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,680
Notice in verse number 4, in him was life and the life was the light of men and the

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,240
light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not or comprehended it not.

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,479
There was a man sent from God whose name was John, that speaking of John the Baptist,

34
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,759
not the apostle John, it says in verse number 7, the same came for a witness to bear witness

35
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,240
of the light that all men through him might believe.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,039
He, John the Baptist, was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light.

37
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,320
That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,160
He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,639
And we find again, as John begins in 1 John chapter number 1, this is the message that

40
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,639
we have heard of him in declaring to you, what is that message?

41
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,039
That God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

42
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:07,720
We find that this contrast of light and darkness is revealed to us in the first chapter of

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,080
this epistle.

44
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:13,639
In fact, you will find many contrasts within the book of 1 John.

45
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,679
This is just one of them, light and darkness.

46
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:21,479
We find that there are many references to light and darkness throughout the remainder

47
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,240
of the epistle of 1 John, but this is not a contrast that is exclusive to the book of

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
1 John.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,919
In fact, as you read the entirety of the New Testament, you'll find many references in

50
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,800
contrasting the truth of light versus darkness.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,039
The initial understanding is dealt with with regard to salvation.

52
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:49,880
Darkness would be representative of being lost of our condition before we trust that

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:57,279
Christ as our Savior were in darkness and light would be that individual that has been

54
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,720
saved that is in Christ.

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,320
And that's the understanding, if you will, one of the applications with regard to light

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,000
versus darkness, lost versus saved, or I should say saved, light versus darkness, lost.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
And we find that throughout the word of God, Ephesians chapter number five mentions it

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,480
this way in Ephesians five and verse number eight.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,399
And we spoke about several references of the book of Ephesians to begin our study through

60
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,760
1 John with regard to the walk of a believer.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,640
But I want you to notice what it says in Ephesians five and verse number eight.

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,519
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.

63
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,239
Walk as children of light.

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:48,399
So what you were, darkness, you were lost, unregenerate, you wereâ€¦that was your condition,

65
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,320
but now are ye light in the Lord.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,359
It says this, that we're to walk as children of light.

67
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:01,959
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number five, we find that to these believers in Thessalonica,

68
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:08,000
this same truth, the contrast is given where he talks about the fact that we are the children

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,359
of light, not of darkness.

70
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:15,920
And again, the understanding of salvation, he deals with it in 1 Peter chapter number

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
two.

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,519
In fact, I know that on a Wednesday evening, this passage of scripture was referenced in

73
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,040
1 Peter chapter number two.

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,880
In verse number nine, the Bible says, but you're a chosen generation, a royal priesthood

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,480
and holy nation, a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him.

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Notice this, who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

77
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,720
And so we understand the truth of the word of God with regard to this contrast that immediately

78
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,239
it's referring to light and darkness, salvation and lost, our condition before the Lord.

79
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:01,799
But we also understand that we are commissioned as we find in verse number seven of 1 John

80
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:06,600
one, but the truth of walking in the light, it's our theme for the year.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,059
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another

82
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:15,679
in the blood of Jesus Christ, his son cleanseth us from all sin.

83
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:21,440
Therefore, there's an understanding of this light versus darkness of walking in fellowship

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,880
Because I am in the light, because I've been born again, that initial truth of light versus

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
darkness.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,839
Now I can walk in the light and have that fellowship with the Lord.

88
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,640
Paul says this to the believers in Corinth.

89
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
You don't need to turn there.

90
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,839
But at the end of verse number 14 of second Corinthians six, he asked this question, what

91
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,160
communion hath light with darkness?

92
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,880
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture and understand what's taking

93
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,000
place, again, the truth that was revealed to us in the first four verses in the introduction

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,119
last week, with regard to the reason of the writing, obviously, we talked about that your

95
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:09,160
joy may be full in one way to have our joy full, really, we looked at the two ways.

96
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,200
One is knowing that you're saved.

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,239
But number two is walking in fellowship.

98
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:20,880
When I'm out of fellowship with the Lord, my joy is affected, it's impacted.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,079
What is it that can steal my joy?

100
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,679
The reality is that no man can steal my joy.

101
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,239
The devil can't steal your joy, and I'm thankful for that.

102
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:36,440
But the reality is that sin robs us of the joy of our salvation, and our fellowship with

103
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
the Lord is hindered.

104
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,640
As we look at this passage of scripture, if you're taking notes, notice number one, the

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,179
blessedness of fellowship.

106
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:47,420
We really see this in verse five, and then in verse number seven.

107
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,720
We see this blessedness of fellowship.

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,880
I would say this, that John was faithful to deliver the message that he'd been given.

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,200
We note that in the beginning of verse number five, when he says, this then is the message

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,839
which we have heard of him and declare unto you.

111
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,000
Aren't you thankful for faithful messengers, faithful servants of the Lord?

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We find that he has received the message, and now he's distributing the message.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,760
He, John, knew what it was to personally walk with God.

114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,040
He knew what it was to walk with the Lord on this earth, physically in his presence.

115
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:30,000
But then you think about after the ascension, this letter of 1 John is written many years

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,760
after the ascension of Jesus Christ.

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,340
And so John has now learned not only what it was to physically walk with the Lord during

118
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,619
his earthly ministry, but now to walk with the Lord even after the Lord has ascended

119
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:44,960
up into heaven.

120
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,039
Now think about the transition for the disciples, the apostles, that did in fact walk with the

121
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,159
Lord Jesus Christ, but then before the ascension in Acts chapter number one, they watched the

122
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,679
Lord Jesus Christ ascend up into heaven.

123
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,979
Man, that was a great change for them.

124
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:05,880
They were called out of whatever field they were in, whatever their occupation was, they

125
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,200
were saved and they became followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,119
And they walked with him and they saw the miracles and they slept where he slept and

127
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:18,960
they ate where he ate and they did all of these things and they walked with him physically

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,840
in his presence and then the presence is removed as far as physically speaking, but now they're

129
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,320
walking with the Lord the same way in which we walk with the Lord.

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,400
And that's a precious truth and we find that John is seeking to communicate this truth

131
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,039
to us under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God with regard to fellowship.

132
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,700
Of course, when we speak about the blessedness of fellowship, I am so thankful that the God

133
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,460
of the universe, the God of heaven has an interest in having fellowship with me.

134
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,700
Does that not blow your mind?

135
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,700
When you understand who God is, when you understand how great our God is, when you understand

136
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,460
understand that He's in control of everything,

137
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,340
He's created everything,

138
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,240
and that He would be interested in you,

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,640
in me, to have fellowship with us.

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,640
There are some people on the face of this earth

141
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,120
that are important, powerful people

142
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,220
from the world's perspective.

143
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,120
And they would not give you one second of their time.

144
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
Right?

145
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,460
They don't know you.

146
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,560
They don't have any interest in having

147
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,260
any kind of communication with you.

148
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,220
But the God of the universe,

149
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,100
the omnipotent, almighty God of the universe,

150
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,740
He desires to have fellowship with us.

151
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
And what is it that enables that fellowship?

152
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,500
We dealt with it in our very first message,

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,740
introductory message to this study

154
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,300
through the book of 1 John.

155
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,220
And we said this, that fellowship requires relationship.

156
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,080
Fellowship requires relationship.

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,780
I cannot have fellowship with the Lord

158
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,380
if I do not belong to Him,

159
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,180
if I've not been saved,

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,280
if I've not trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior.

161
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,020
We find that in verse number two,

162
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,440
remember one of those subjects

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,680
that He was going to deal with

164
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,620
as we spoke about the content

165
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,020
of this witness that is provided to us

166
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,680
was that of eternal life.

167
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,660
The source of eternal life is the Lord.

168
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,260
And we understand it's through the blood of Jesus Christ.

169
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,000
And when we have that relationship,

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,460
when I belong to Him, He belongs to me,

171
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,900
He's my Father, I'm His child,

172
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,800
that relationship now enables fellowship.

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
I cannot have fellowship with Him

174
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,540
if I do not belong to Him.

175
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,500
And I only can belong to Him

176
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
is if I come through the blood.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,780
There's only one way to approach the Lord,

178
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,040
and it's through the blood.

179
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
It's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,180
Remember what Jesus said in John 14,

181
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,240
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

182
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,280
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

183
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,620
There's only one way to have access to God,

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,980
and that's through the Son,

185
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,420
through the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

186
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,340
We see that in verse number seven.

187
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,180
Notice the Bible says, but if we walk in the light

188
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,620
as He is in the light, because He is light,

189
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,300
and in Him is no darkness at all,

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,360
it's already been settled in verse number five.

191
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Notice we have fellowship one with another,

192
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,200
and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,

193
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,360
cleanseth us from all sin.

194
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm so thankful to be saved.

195
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,140
I'm so thankful to be forgiven.

196
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,300
But that forgiveness leads to not only eternal life

197
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,340
and the truth with regard to my eternal destiny,

198
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,840
but it also leads to having fellowship with God,

199
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,980
and that sweet communion with the Lord.

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
The fact that we can commune with Him,

201
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,420
that I can speak to Him.

202
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,480
I can enter into a time of prayer and seek His face.

203
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,220
I can take this precious book, the Bible,

204
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,900
and I can sit and I can read

205
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
and learn the mind of the Lord,

206
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,060
and He speaks to me through His word,

207
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,920
and what a blessing that is.

208
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,460
And we think about the blessedness of salvation,

209
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,400
and we understand that a fellowship,

210
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,580
the blessedness of fellowship,

211
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,020
and that this is only possible because we are saved.

212
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,220
The content of this section of 1 John

213
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
addresses the blessedness of fellowship,

214
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,780
but then really focuses upon the hindrance to fellowship,

215
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,480
and then how to have that hindered fellowship restored.

216
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,620
So number two in your notes,

217
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,080
if you are taking notes this morning,

218
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,800
I want you to notice the hindrance to fellowship.

219
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
We've mentioned the blessedness of fellowship,

220
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
and I'm thankful for it,

221
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
but we understand that though we have been saved

222
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,740
and though we have a relationship with the Lord,

223
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,080
and I'm His and He is mine,

224
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,220
and what a blessed truth that is,

225
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,280
we understand biblically that my fellowship can be hindered.

226
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,800
We mentioned this last week

227
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,160
as we spoke about relationships on this earth.

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,520
We spoke about a relationship between a husband and a wife,

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,640
between a parent and a child,

230
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,880
and those relationships are understood,

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,280
and we understand those relationships,

232
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,400
but we also understand that the fellowship

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,240
in those relationships can be hindered.

234
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,120
There are parents and children

235
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,480
that unfortunately are not in good fellowship

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,960
one with another.

237
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,640
Oh, they have a relationship.

238
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,800
It's still the father, it's still the mother,

239
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,080
it's still the son or the daughter.

240
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,200
There's a relationship that is there,

241
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,740
but the fellowship has been hindered.

242
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,440
The fellowship is not what it's been designed to be,

243
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,800
and we find that there can be hindrance in our lives

244
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,480
and our fellowship with the Lord,

245
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,840
and we see this really in verses six, eight, and 10,

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,420
the even verses here in our passage of scripture

247
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,559
that we're looking at this morning.

248
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,140
We see what it is that would be a hindrance

249
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,040
to our fellowship.

250
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,000
In one word, we'd say sins,

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
and we find that in verse number six, eight, and 10,

252
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,360
it's very interesting that each of these verses

253
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,760
begin with this phrase, if we say.

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,040
Isn't that interesting?

255
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,400
If we say.

256
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,720
The reality is that you can say anything,

257
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
and I can say anything,

258
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,200
and what we find in these verses of scripture

259
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,960
is what we claim versus what we really are.

260
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
By the way, we see that in Revelation three

261
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,520
with the church of the Laodiceans.

262
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,880
We see that they say they have an opinion,

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,480
they have a perspective as to their condition,

264
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,260
but God says something entirely different

265
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,480
about their condition.

266
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
In fact, what they really were

267
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,040
had hindered their fellowship with God.

268
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,080
How do we know that?

269
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,400
Well, because in Revelation three in verse number 20,

270
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
it says, behold, I stand at the door and knock,

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,279
and if any man will open, I will enter,

272
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,040
and I will sup with him, right?

273
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,640
That fellowship with him that is possible,

274
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,520
and we know that that fellowship is hindered,

275
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,040
and here we see three occasions, verse six, eight, and 10,

276
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
where the Bible speaks about this hindered fellowship,

277
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,440
and we notice that it begins with if we say.

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Notice what it said in verse number six.

279
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,480
If we say that we have fellowship with him,

280
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,700
and yet we walk in darkness,

281
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,700
we lie and do not the truth.

282
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,559
If we say that we have fellowship with him

283
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,559
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

284
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
We find in verse number eight, notice what we say.

285
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,920
If we say that we have no sin,

286
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,920
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

287
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Do you see in verse number six, it says that we lie.

288
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,000
If we say that we have fellowship,

289
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,559
but we walk in darkness, we lie.

290
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,800
But now in verse number eight,

291
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,080
if we say that we have no sin,

292
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,040
notice what he says, we deceive ourselves.

293
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,480
When we lie, typically, if you lie,

294
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,820
if someone lies to you, they're trying to deceive you, right?

295
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,640
If I lie to you, it's because I'm trying to deceive you.

296
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,200
If you lie to me, it's because you're trying to deceive me.

297
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
Is that fair?

298
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,200
And we find here, however, notice the progression

299
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,720
that if we say that we have fellowship with him,

300
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
but we're walking in darkness, we lie,

301
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,000
and we do not the truth.

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
Or, and then we find in verse number eight,

303
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,920
he says, if we say that we have no sin,

304
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,760
notice we deceive ourselves.

305
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,480
No longer are we deceiving someone else

306
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
because of our lying,

307
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,600
but now our lying is deceiving ourselves.

308
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,559
Self-deception, I've said over the years,

309
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,460
is the worst form of deception.

310
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,779
It's one thing to be deceived by someone else,

311
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,180
but it's a far worse thing to be deceived by yourself,

312
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,140
to think that you're something that you're not.

313
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,320
You've pretended for so long, you've lied for so long,

314
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,260
that you've deceived yourself.

315
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,260
Notice what he says, and the truth is not in us.

316
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,540
Notice verse number 10.

317
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,940
If we say, again, we notice the approach

318
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,260
and we notice the claim, notice here,

319
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,260
that we have not sinned, we make him a liar.

320
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,880
Who's the him?

321
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,720
That's God.

322
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,680
Wow.

323
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,360
This is a serious progression, is it not?

324
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,740
If we say that we have fellowship with him

325
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,740
and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.

326
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,380
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,

327
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,300
and the truth is not in us.

328
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,299
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar,

329
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,460
and his word is not in us.

330
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,760
Can I tell you this morning that God is not a liar?

331
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,179
Amen?

332
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,660
God has said, for all have sinned

333
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,820
and come short of the glory of God.

334
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,100
There's not a just man, a righteous man,

335
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,020
that walketh upon the face of the earth,

336
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,580
and we understand here that he says,

337
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,900
here's what you're saying.

338
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,780
You're saying that you're walking in fellowship,

339
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,739
but you're actually walking in darkness.

340
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,900
You say that you have no sin.

341
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
You're deceiving yourselves.

342
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,980
You say that you've not sinned,

343
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,220
and you're making him a liar.

344
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,980
There's also a similarity between each of these verses.

345
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,559
We note what is said.

346
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,580
We note the claim.

347
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,780
We note the progression of we lie, we deceive ourselves,

348
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,780
we make him a liar, but I want you to also reference,

349
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,700
did you see, did you note,

350
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,580
as we've looked at these verses of Scripture,

351
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,020
the reference to God's word in each verse?

352
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,040
What is the reference in verse number six?

353
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,340
We do not the truth.

354
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,900
What is the truth?

355
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Thy word is truth.

356
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,059
Is that not what John 17 says?

357
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:37,739
Thy word is truth, and so we note that it says

358
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,900
that we do not the truth.

359
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,859
Notice in verse number 18, at the end of the verse,

360
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:47,260
and the truth is not in us.

361
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Notice in verse number 10 that his word is not in us.

362
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,380
An absence of truth is directly linked

363
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,299
to hindered fellowship in this portion of Scripture.

364
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,260
It was D.L. Moody that said many years ago.

365
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,100
He made the statement, I read it and I've repeated it many times over the years, that

366
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,100
sin will keep you from this book, or this book will keep you from sin.

367
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,660
And the reality is what we find here in 1 John, in the first chapter in verse 6, 8,

368
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,420
and 10, when we think about this hindered fellowship, we note that there's an absence

369
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:30,140
of the Word of God, the truth, it says that we do not the truth, we're not doers of

370
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,140
the Word.

371
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,460
1 John speaks about the importance of being doers of the Word and not hearers only, that

372
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,140
we're not applying truth in our life.

373
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,220
We say in verse number 8 and again in verse number 10 that His Word, His truth is not

374
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,420
in us.

375
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,820
Well then we find that there's a great secret that is revealed here to us in this portion

376
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,540
of Scripture and that is the importance, the place that God's Word would serve in our lives,

377
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,700
to help us remain in fellowship with Him.

378
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,580
Think about the truth, turn to 2 Timothy chapter number 3 if you will, and consider

379
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,220
the truth that is before us with regard to what is said about the Word of God in this

380
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,860
portion of Scripture.

381
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,460
When you think about the hindered fellowship, the hindrance to fellowship that is mentioned

382
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,420
in 1 John chapter number 1, and you notice what is said, but you notice that there's

383
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,300
an absence of truth in this link between the absence of truth to hindered fellowship.

384
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,100
In 2 Timothy chapter number 3 in verse number 16, a familiar verse of Scripture, the Bible

385
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,580
says this, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

386
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,660
It says this, and is profitable.

387
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm thankful that God gave us His Word, inspiration, God breathed.

388
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,100
We notice that He mentions in verse number 15 that from a child thou hast known the Holy

389
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Scriptures.

390
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,940
He'd be referring to the Old Testament.

391
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,620
The New Testament's not yet completed at this time.

392
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,660
But He says that all Scripture, the entirety of it, every part of it is given by inspiration

393
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,700
of God, and it is profitable.

394
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,260
What is it profitable for?

395
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:10,620
Well, it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.

396
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,020
And we find that the Word of God is profitable to us, yes, for doctrine, for our beliefs,

397
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,380
for that body of doctrine that we hold dear, the faith as it's referred to by Jude that

398
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,380
we're to earnestly contend for the faith.

399
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,900
But you notice the phraseology of for reproof and for correction.

400
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,660
The fact that there are times in which we're wrong and we need to be reproved.

401
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,860
There are times in which we need to be corrected, that the Word of God, as we get into the Word

402
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,860
of God, as we study the Word of God, as we apply the Word of God, the Word of God will

403
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,460
correct us.

404
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,260
It will show us where we're wrong in our thinking.

405
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,100
It'll show us where we're wrong in our actions.

406
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,380
And when we find that we go to the Word of God, it not only is profitable for doctrine,

407
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,500
for reproof, for correction, but for instruction in righteousness.

408
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,700
It teaches us how to live a life that is pleasing to God.

409
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,580
It teaches us what God is pleased with and what God is not pleased with.

410
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,900
How is it that we would know that I have...

411
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,380
Well, let me just give you this.

412
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,740
Turn to Romans chapter number 7.

413
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,780
Look at this passage of Scripture because Paul testifies of himself here with regard

414
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,060
to this truth of how sin is revealed to us through the Word of God.

415
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,940
There are people, very few people, that I've ever met that have denied ever sinning.

416
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,100
There's just been a couple of people that I've ever met that I've asked them, have you

417
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
ever sinned?

418
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
And they say, no, not me.

419
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm like, man, we got some work to do here, man, because I am sure that I can show you

420
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,820
that you've sinned, amen?

421
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,080
And we try to get into it.

422
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,540
But let me say this.

423
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,420
We know that to be the truth, and of us that are sitting here this morning, I think most

424
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,740
of us would say readily, yes, we acknowledge sin.

425
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,380
We understand that there's sins in our lives.

426
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,220
I said this as I was preaching through the book of Colossians last year when we dealt

427
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,060
with the sins of a believer, and there was this reference of this interaction between

428
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,100
the preacher and one of the church members, and the church members said to the preacher,

429
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100
I don't understand why you're preaching about sins in the life of believers.

430
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,339
Don't you understand that sin in the life of a believer is different than sin in the

431
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,180
life of an unbeliever?

432
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,540
The preacher said, yeah, it's worse.

433
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,680
That's really true.

434
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,660
But here's the problem sometimes in our lives.

435
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,300
If we say what we're looking at here, this hindrance to fellowship, you know what happens

436
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
sometimes?

437
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,380
We'll get to our point in just a moment as we finish up the message this morning of confession

438
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,100
and having that restoration, but we say something like this, Father, if we've sinned, what do

439
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,779
you mean if?

440
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,339
Do you understand what I'm saying?

441
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,860
But sometimes that's how we pray.

442
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,900
What do you mean if we have sinned?

443
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,540
There's a testimony of a preacher that was working with someone in a, it was like a tent

444
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,339
meeting situation, and this man, man, he heard the preaching of the Word of God, and there

445
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,380
was this, it was kind of a citywide crusade.

446
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,180
There were many churches that were represented, a lot of lost people there.

447
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
People were getting saved.

448
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,420
People were getting right with God, and this man comes to the aisle, and he's dealing with

449
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,540
this local pastor in this area where this tent meeting is, and the man is just, he's

450
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,059
just, man, God just worked in my heart through this message, and I'm just, I got so many

451
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,339
things going on in my life, and this, that, and the other thing, and blah, blah, blah,

452
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:26,779
and he goes through, and let's pray, and let's get this thing straightened out, and he begins

453
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,059
with what I just said, if I have sinned.

454
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,020
And the preacher stopped him and said, no, no, no, you just told me that you have.

455
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,020
So now, why, when you pray to God, are you saying, if we have sinned, or I have sinned?

456
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,540
And the reality is that, look at what Paul says in Romans 7.

457
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,339
In verse number 7, he says this, what shall we say then?

458
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,779
Is the law sin?

459
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,779
God forbid.

460
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:58,020
Notice what he says, nay, I had not known sin, but by the law, for I had not known lust,

461
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:05,140
except the law had said, thou shalt not covet, right?

462
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,460
And so, when we understand, listen again, the absence of truth in verse 6, 8, and 10

463
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,380
is a direct link to hindered fellowship.

464
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,940
The sins that would hinder the fellowship, the absence of the Word of God, you do not

465
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,339
the truth, the truth is not in us, His Word is not in us.

466
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,740
And when we get the Word of God, and we begin to study the Word of God, and we regularly

467
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,860
feast upon the Word of God, you know what God's Word does?

468
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,660
It confronts us about our sins.

469
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,220
The closer you get to the light, the more you see the sins, right?

470
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,020
That's how it works.

471
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,460
You say, man, I feel like the closer I get to God, the more He reveals.

472
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Yeah.

473
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,180
You ever see those?

474
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,660
I've never used one.

475
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,180
I've seen them.

476
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,540
But ladies have these makeup mirrors, right, 35X, lights all around them.

477
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,460
I remember as a child sitting in my grandmother, my mom's mom, sitting in her kitchen, and

478
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,619
she would get her makeup on, and it was a process.

479
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,619
I'm serious.

480
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,300
I mean, it was like, it was a process.

481
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,619
And she'd bring this light out, and I mean, all these, back then there were no LEDs, right,

482
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:21,460
all these light bulbs around this thing.

483
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,660
It looked like, I don't even know what it looked like, it was kind of a weird little

484
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,220
deal with a mirror in the middle, all these lights.

485
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,980
And I remember sitting there, I was probably seven or eight years old.

486
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,779
I called her my mom, that was what we referred to her as, and I said, my mom, why do you

487
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,779
use that?

488
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,180
She said, well, all these lights show the imperfections.

489
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,140
She said, so I know where I have to put the makeup.

490
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,660
That's what she said to me.

491
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,220
Now, all these years later, not just now, but several years ago, I wasn't saved at the

492
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,860
time, didn't go to church at that time, but when I read 1 John, I was beginning to realize

493
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,779
the truth of what she told me as a child with regard to her makeup mirror with all these

494
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:04,380
lights, and the spiritual truth that the closer I get to the light, God is light, and in Him

495
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,820
is no darkness at all, that all of a sudden that light starts shining and revealing sins

496
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
in my life.

497
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,900
There's been a time when you're walking with Christ, and you're like, man, I didn't even

498
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,980
realize that was, I didn't realize I was doing that, I didn't realize it was wrong, I didn't

499
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,460
realize, and God's Word confronts us with sins, and as we're confronted with sins, we

500
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,140
better deal with sins, amen?

501
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:31,380
There were sins of commission and sins of omission in the Old Testament that are dealt

502
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,179
with, and we understand that, but here, as we look at this portion of Scripture, and

503
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,559
we really look at the hypocrisy in verses 6, 8, and 10, we look at the self-deception,

504
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,820
we look at the individual that is kind of above the situation, and they've gotten into

505
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,979
this position where now they have this hindered fellowship.

506
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:58,100
As we look at the passage of Scripture back in 1 John chapter number 1, we note the blessedness

507
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,619
of fellowship, we note the hindrance to fellowship, but I want you to focus on verse number 9

508
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:10,960
with me as we conclude this morning and look at the restoration of fellowship, the restoration

509
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
of fellowship.

510
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,479
I'm so thankful that hindered fellowship doesn't have to remain hindered fellowship.

511
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm thankful that there's a way back to God, amen?

512
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,559
And the way back to God isn't that you have to get saved again.

513
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,119
Salvation, being born again, is a one-time event in your life.

514
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:37,440
It's a time in which you understand that you are on your way to hell because of your sin,

515
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,600
you're on your way to the lake of fire, and that you're a sinner and that you're guilty

516
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,119
and that Jesus Christ is the only Savior, and you place your faith and trust in Jesus

517
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:51,600
Christ alone for your salvation, and He gives you the gift of God, which is eternal life.

518
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,160
And you shall never perish and no man shall ever pluck you out of the Father's hand.

519
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,359
We are kept by the power of God.

520
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,239
But when our fellowship is hindered, how do we have it restored?

521
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,199
The restoration of fellowship is dealt with in verse number nine.

522
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,519
I want to ask you this. Look at verse number nine.

523
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:14,159
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all

524
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,959
unrighteousness. Now, isn't that a precious verse of Scripture?

525
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,839
It is a verse of Scripture in which many of us have committed to memory.

526
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,999
We find that in this verse of Scripture, I wonder if you noted the sins

527
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:31,639
plural in verse number nine,

528
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:39,239
versus the sin in verse number seven and eight that is referenced as being singular. At the end of verse number seven,

529
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,879
notice the Bible says in the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,

530
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:46,359
cleanseth us from all sin.

531
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:50,439
In verse number eight, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

532
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:55,159
The truth is not in us, but notice what he says in verse number nine. If we confess our sins,

533
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,279
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I want to be careful.

534
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,439
I hope to explain this in such a way that there's no confusion.

535
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:09,079
And I know on Wednesday evening, Jeff did a great job dealing with some of this with regard to the offerings.

536
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,039
And when he spoke about the offerings, he talked about what enabled fellowship,

537
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:17,239
but then also what maintains fellowship. If you didn't hear that on Wednesday night,

538
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:21,479
we'll make sure that we get you a copy. But it was a great message that he shared on Wednesday evening.

539
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:27,079
I appreciated it. As we look at this contrast in sins versus sin, I want you to think about it this way.

540
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,679
Sin would really be representative of our condition, what we are. We're sinners.

541
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,359
Right? We sin because we're sinners.

542
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,159
Right? That's why we sin.

543
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,879
It's not that we become sinners because we sin, for we know that we're born sinners.

544
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:47,799
Right? You don't have to teach a child to do wrong.

545
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,879
You don't have to teach a child to sin.

546
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:55,959
Everyone that's had a toddler understands that and says, where did this kid get this from? He's got a sin nature.

547
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,979
Right? Now there are some things that they learn, no doubt, but they have a sin nature.

548
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,759
Sins, if we think about it plural in verse number nine, is what we do. It's our conduct.

549
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,879
Now think about it this way.

550
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,799
It's my sins that hinder my fellowship with the Lord.

551
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,199
Sin has been dealt with. Remember, John is writing here to believers.

552
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:28,919
He's writing to those that have trusted Christ as their Savior, that have the privilege of fellowship because they've been born again.

553
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:33,879
That privilege of fellowship with God is reserved to the child of God.

554
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,039
And as we think about that privilege of fellowship that has been reserved to the child of God,

555
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:47,479
we note that that same fellowship that is a privilege to every child of God can be hindered because of our sins.

556
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,719
And if my sins hinder my fellowship with God,

557
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,699
how is it that I can have that fellowship restored? I would say that it begins with this. Number one, with an honest evaluation.

558
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,559
With an honest evaluation.

559
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:08,699
Looking into the perfect law of liberty. That's what is said in James chapter number one, in verse number 25,

560
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,139
James calls the word of God the perfect law of liberty.

561
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:16,059
And I want you to think about what he says in this passage of scripture.

562
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,899
He talks about being doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving our own selves.

563
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:22,379
But he says this in verse 25 of James one,

564
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:29,519
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein,

565
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:35,419
he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

566
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:39,599
I believe that as we look at our lives in this honest evaluation,

567
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:44,799
it must be that we go to the word of God. We look into the perfect law of liberty.

568
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:52,779
If I'm going to determine how my fellowship has been hindered with my God and how my sins have hindered my fellowship with God,

569
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:58,779
it's not that I'm going to compare my life with Michael's life or Michael's going to compare his life with Ryan's life

570
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:03,499
and try to determine, well, I'm better than he is. No, no, we look into the perfect law of liberty.

571
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:07,979
And as we look into the perfect law of liberty and as we ask God,

572
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,619
show me, Lord, from your word,

573
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,059
things

574
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,459
that I'm not doing that I need to be doing.

575
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:21,019
Show me, reveal to me the things that I'm doing that I need not to be doing. Reveal to me the sins

576
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,160
in my life that need to be addressed.

577
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:31,019
Oftentimes, even as we mentioned the book of Colossians, as we preached last year through that book,

578
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:37,500
many times the people of God don't care much when you're preaching about murder and you're preaching about

579
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:44,699
these great sins and say, man, I'm not guilty of murder. I'm not guilty of adultery. That's wonderful.

580
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,339
But what about gossip?

581
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,220
We don't like hearing preaching about gossip. You know why? A lot of us are guilty.

582
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
And we just don't like it, right?

583
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:58,539
Now, I'm not going to go through a whole list this morning,

584
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:02,639
but the reality is that when I read the word of God in its entirety

585
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:10,139
and I ask God to show me, to reveal to me, all of a sudden He begins to reveal to me sins in my life

586
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
that are hindering my fellowship.

587
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,380
If you feel like your fellowship is hindered, sometimes maybe in a relationship, maybe husband and wife,

588
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,940
something's happening, you just feel like, man,

589
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,380
it seems like my wife's been a little bit cold to me or seems like my husband's a little cold to me.

590
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:28,859
Something seems wrong. Do we just kind of go about our day and say, well, it's just as what it is?

591
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:31,819
No, I hope that you at least say, hey, did I do something?

592
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,539
Did I say something?

593
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,699
And then maybe you find out that they just weren't feeling well, or maybe you did do something.

594
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,500
Well, actually, since you asked, and then you say, man, I shouldn't have asked. I'm just teasing.

595
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:48,859
But the reality is that, listen, why would we say something like that? Why? Because we want the fellowship

596
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:52,380
we should desire to have that fellowship restored

597
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,179
with our spouse,

598
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:57,979
parent, and a child. But what about with our God?

599
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,179
I don't want to walk through life

600
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,899
with hindered fellowship.

601
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,139
No, I want to be in sweet communion with my God.

602
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:11,679
And there must be an honest evaluation.

603
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,380
We mention as we preach and talk about the Lord's Supper in 1 Corinthians 11, if a man examined himself,

604
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,559
but let a man examine himself.

605
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,599
That is a serious process. It is a sobering process to take the Word of God and say, God, show me,

606
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,479
reveal to me, search me, O God.

607
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,639
Not somebody else,

608
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:40,319
but me, because I'm concerned about my walk with you.

609
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,479
I'm concerned about my fellowship with you. So, it begins with an honest evaluation. It must have,

610
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,720
after the honest evaluation, there must be, number two, an acknowledgement of sins.

611
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:58,479
Understand with me this morning that you're never going to confess your sins if you don't acknowledge your sins.

612
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,239
You're just not going to. You're not going to think there's anything that you need to confess,

613
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,679
because you've not had the honest evaluation. There's not been an acknowledgement of sins.

614
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,479
Sometimes when there's

615
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
a service, whether it's

616
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:18,000
me as the pastor preaching, whether it's a missionary that's preaching or an evangelist that's preaching,

617
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,799
sometimes there's a message that's preached on sins,

618
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,959
and people shy away from going forward because they don't want to,

619
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,599
I don't want anyone to think that I'm a sinner. We already know you are.

620
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,279
Right?

621
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:36,799
Do you understand what I'm saying? We already know. We know what we are.

622
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,679
We're sinners.

623
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,359
Saved by grace,

624
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,880
heaven-bound,

625
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
but we're not perfect.

626
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,919
And there ought not be any judgment. Man, I rejoice with my brother or sister that's having their fellowship restored.

627
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,639
Amen?

628
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,559
It should cause us to rejoice greatly. It should not cause us, listen,

629
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,919
can I tell you a sin that you're dealing with if you won't want to go get it right? Pride.

630
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
I don't want anyone to think I'm a sinner. We already know.

631
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,079
And now pride is hindering your fellowship even more.

632
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,079
Right?

633
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,039
And so we look at this passage, we say, listen, there must be an acknowledgement. Every single person is impacted.

634
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,759
I understand that there was teaching from years gone by,

635
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,119
from certain groups of people that would teach and believe and peddle their ideas that you could reach in this life a place of

636
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,639
sinless perfection. I do not find it within the Word of God.

637
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:35,059
I reach a place of sinless perfection when this mortal shall put on immortality,

638
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:40,339
when this corruption shall put on incorruption. And that's not going to happen until I go to be with the Lord.

639
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:44,260
Amen? And you have flesh and I have flesh.

640
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,219
And the devil is the tempter,

641
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,419
right?

642
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:51,940
He's shooting all of his fiery darts. He's trying to tempt us. He's trying to hinder us.

643
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,820
He's trying to to destroy us, to devour us.

644
00:38:54,979 --> 00:39:00,899
And we find that there must be an acknowledgement of sins. And then comes the verse, verse number nine, if we confess

645
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,539
our sins,

646
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:05,859
confession of sins, number three in our list,

647
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:11,140
there's an honest evaluation followed by an acknowledgement of sins that leads to a confession of sins.

648
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:15,380
We must refuse to cover or to excuse our sins.

649
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:22,760
God begins to deal with an individual with regard to their temper. Well, you know, it's because of my ancestry.

650
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,700
I'm of this particular, you know,

651
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,000
background, trying to be politically correct, and we're just known for our tempers.

652
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
No, no, you're a sinner.

653
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,979
Right?

654
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:41,080
And sometimes we excuse our behavior.

655
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,700
Well, if that person didn't do, hold on, that person doesn't control you.

656
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,739
Right? I wouldn't have done that if they didn't. Ah, stop.

657
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Do you know what the word confess means?

658
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:55,779
It literally means to say the same thing of.

659
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:01,219
It's not this idea of, Lord, I confess all my sins. No, no, it's a lot more.

660
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:08,659
specific than that. A lot more specific. God, in that situation, I lied. I did not tell the truth.

661
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:14,259
And God, I know that that's wicked. You said that you hate lying lips. All of a sudden,

662
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:20,499
it gets real when we start praying that way. Right? And we say, God, that was not right.

663
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:27,699
Would you forgive me for that? Cleanse me from that. Help me to have victory over that in my

664
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:34,899
life. And we call sin what it is. So often in our lives today, we try to sugarcoat sin.

665
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:42,659
It's not to be sugarcoated. It is what caused Jesus Christ to go to the cross of Calvary.

666
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:49,299
Right? And when we understand that, listen, in the Old Testament, there were offerings that

667
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:55,299
had to be brought. If we had to bring an offering every time, it'd be a lot different.

668
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:05,059
I'm glad that we live when we live. Okay? But you understand there was a great awareness of sins

669
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:10,739
under the Old Testament law. Because every time you turn around, there's an offering that has

670
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:16,739
to be brought. And as New Testament believers, sometimes we don't have that same awareness of

671
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,099
sins in our lives. Why? Because we just kind of are going through life. We're just going

672
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:26,819
through the motions. We're saying that we have fellowship with God, but we're actually walking

673
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:34,979
in darkness. We find that it says this, this confession of sins, refusing to cover, refusing

674
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:44,419
to excuse our sins. Notice it says, if we confess our sins, this is precious. He is faithful and

675
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:55,779
just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The cleansing from sins,

676
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:04,179
the reason that He cleanses us from sin is because He is faithful and He is just.

677
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,219
It's interesting to me, we sang two songs today,

678
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:13,779
Grace, Greater Than Our Sin, and then we sang Great is Thy Faithfulness.

679
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:19,779
How perfect those two songs fit with this message this morning. I don't pick the songs,

680
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:24,099
Dean does. They don't always line up exactly like they have this morning,

681
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:28,019
but it's always precious when it does that. You see the hand of God in that.

682
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:35,219
The update letter that Michael provided us an update of, I really hesitated on giving him

683
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:40,419
that letter on Wednesday because of the subject matter and what it dealt with. Maybe that's not

684
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:44,739
a good update letter to give on a Sunday morning, a missionary that has to deal with sins in the

685
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:49,299
church and church discipline and getting all this kind of thing. The Holy Spirit of God said,

686
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:53,459
don't you remember what you're preaching on Sunday morning? That is exactly the update

687
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:59,219
letter that needs to be given because sin in the life of a believer is a bad deal.

688
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,059
I'm thankful that I'm heaven bound, but I don't want my fellowship to be hindered.

689
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:12,259
I'm thankful that God is faithful and just. He's righteous. He always does what He says

690
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:16,579
He will do. This is a great promise. I mentioned this morning in our Sunday school hour how that

691
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:21,459
He is ready to pardon, ready to forgive, and what a blessing that is. It says that He forgives us

692
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:27,859
of our sins, and it says that He cleanses us from all unrighteousness. What a blessing.

693
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:34,019
Proverbs 28 and verse 13 says that He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

694
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:41,459
There's no prospering in covering our sin because the reality is that when we, when I,

695
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:48,179
or when you cover our sin, we're only covering it from each other, but God already knows about it.

696
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:53,939
Right? And what really matters, that I look good to you, that you look good to me,

697
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:59,619
or that our walk with God is what it ought to be. Right? That's really what matters.

698
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:05,779
In Proverbs 28, 13, He that cover the sins shall not prosper, notice, but whoso confesseth

699
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:12,899
and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Wow. I'm so thankful for the mercy of God.

700
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:17,379
I'll give you an assignment this evening since we're not having church, John 13. I was planning

701
00:44:17,379 --> 00:44:21,139
to spend more time here, but I'm just going to mention a couple of things in John 13.

702
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:26,259
I think it's a great picture if you have just a moment to turn there. In John 13 verses 3 through

703
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:32,019
10, we think about this forgiveness, this cleansing that is mentioned in 1 John 1 and verse

704
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:38,179
number 9, and we notice in John 13, if you're familiar, as soon as I said John 13, some of you

705
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:41,939
already knew that it's dealing with the time in which the Lord Jesus Christ washed the feet of

706
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:47,699
the disciples. I won't have the time to develop all the thought that I wanted to develop this

707
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:52,659
morning from this passage of Scripture in closing, but I think it's a great picture of really what

708
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:56,419
we're dealing with here this morning. You'll remember that as Jesus begins to wash the feet

709
00:44:56,419 --> 00:45:01,379
of the disciples, eventually He comes to Peter. When He comes to Peter, what does Peter say?

710
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:12,819
Not so, my Lord. No, no. No. Peter saith unto Him after this situation,

711
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:20,099
Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus said, what I do thou knowest not in verse number 7 now,

712
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,139
but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter said, thou shalt never wash my feet.

713
00:45:26,979 --> 00:45:32,339
Jesus said, if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter then says, I mean,

714
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:38,339
he totally changed his tone, right? All right, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

715
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:47,139
Notice what Jesus says in verse number 10. He that is washed needeth not save to wash His feet,

716
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:54,499
but is clean every wit, and ye are clean, but not all. In verse number 10, in closing this morning,

717
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,939
if you think about the customs of the day, the culture in which the Lord Jesus Christ was living,

718
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:06,899
and as the Scriptures are written, often you find about the washing of the feet.

719
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:12,019
You find that they'd enter into a home, and there'd be servants that would wash feet.

720
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:16,739
And you understand that they wore sandals, and they walked the same roads that their

721
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,419
livestock walked, and so on and so forth, and so feet became very dirty.

722
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:30,019
And in that particular era, they did not have the luxuries that we have today of inside plumbing,

723
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,419
and bathrooms, and showers, and so on and so forth, and they would have bath houses.

724
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:38,419
And what would happen is you'd go down to the bath house, and you'd get washed.

725
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:44,499
But then you'd put on your robe, you'd put on your sandals, and you'd walk home,

726
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:51,219
and guess what would get dirty? Your feet. So, when Jesus says in verse number 10,

727
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:58,019
he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, they understand this truth of what

728
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:02,819
they experienced when they would go, and they'd get washed. They'd go to the bath house,

729
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:07,299
but then they would come, and they'd have dirty feet, and before they'd enter into their home,

730
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:10,979
they'd have to wash their feet again. They didn't have to get bathed again,

731
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:19,059
just had to wash their feet. The spiritual truth of John 13 would be clear to us that He that is

732
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:25,779
saved, the sin, the condition has already been dealt with, what we are.

733
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:35,139
But our feet get dirty. We live in this sin-cursed world, and we need to have that continued cleansing

734
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:40,899
from our sins. Does that make sense? Study John 13 more this afternoon, this evening. I don't

735
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:46,339
have time to develop all of it, but the reality is that as we walk with Christ, what joy it is,

736
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:51,539
the blessedness of fellowship. Listen, the fellowship's only possible because of relationship.

737
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:58,899
What enables it? There has to be that sin offering that was dealt with on Wednesday evening.

738
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:07,859
And I'm thankful that Jesus Christ made one sacrifice for sin forever. Amen? What joy,

739
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:15,619
Hebrews 10 tells us. And after we're saved, we now have this opportunity for fellowship.

740
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:18,739
But there are times in our lives we've experienced that there's been

741
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:26,179
hindrances to our fellowship. My fellowship's been hindered. Sins hinder my fellowship.

742
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:35,379
And if I understand that God, He gives us the recipe, if you will, to how to have restored

743
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:41,779
fellowship, and that really is the focus of the message this morning, the restoration of fellowship,

744
00:48:41,779 --> 00:48:47,779
how we can have that sweet communion with the Lord, the way back to God, if you will,

745
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:51,939
if we could use that terminology. And I'm so thankful that He is faithful and just.

746
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:57,779
And if we have that honest evaluation, if we acknowledge our sins, if we confess them to the

747
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:02,179
Lord, understanding that He's faithful and just and that He's going to forgive us and cleanse us,

748
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:08,739
we have that restored fellowship. Listen, don't let sins hinder your fellowship with God.

749
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:18,500
Deal with them. Confess them. Listen, God already knows about them, right? Did God know that Adam

750
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,779
and Eve were naked in the garden? Did He know where they were in the garden? So when He said,

751
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:28,739
where are you, did He really was looking for information? No, He knew exactly where they were.

752
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:35,699
This morning, God knows if we have sins in our lives.

753
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:41,059
And if you have sins in your life this morning that have hindered your fellowship,

754
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:47,699
it doesn't make you unique, for we all have sins that hinder our fellowship.

755
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:53,379
Maybe this morning you just need to deal with some of them. Maybe this morning you ask God,

756
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:58,179
help me to stay in the Word because I understand the absence of the Word is the direct link

757
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:01,139
to hindered fellowship. Help me to stay in the Word. Stay clean.

758
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:04,219
close to you so that fellowship doesn't get hindered.

759
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:06,779
Help me to be able to identify in my life

760
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:09,739
as soon as that fellowship is hindered

761
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:12,459
because I don't wanna grow cold.

762
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:15,459
I don't wanna drift apart and not even know

763
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,679
that my fellowship's been hindered

764
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,419
until there's this great chasm between

765
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:22,859
what my fellowship used to be and what it is now.

766
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,579
You ever hear a couple been married for a long time

767
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:27,539
and they say, well, you know, we just drifted apart.

768
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:29,239
You ever hear somebody say that?

769
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:30,779
They're getting divorced when they're like 60

770
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,919
and you're saying, what's going on with that?

771
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:34,679
I don't mean to be inappropriate by saying that.

772
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:36,159
It's just puzzling to me.

773
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:39,319
And so often you'll hear people that say,

774
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:42,179
we just drifted apart over the years.

775
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:43,999
I don't wanna drift from God.

776
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:46,639
Amen?

777
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,879
By the way, God's not drifting from us.

778
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,239
If there's any drifting, it's me drifting from God.

779
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:56,119
And oh, that we could rejoice in knowing

780
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,799
that there's a way back to God, that restored fellowship.

781
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:00,639
Let's pray.

782
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:01,799
Father, we love you.

783
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:03,459
How we love you.

784
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,799
You're so good to us.

785
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:07,019
You saved us.

786
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:10,179
You desire to have fellowship with us.

787
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,179
When we hinder that fellowship,

788
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:18,259
you provide a way back to have restored fellowship.

789
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:19,299
It's wonderful.

790
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:22,899
God, if there's one here this morning that's not saved,

791
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:24,419
they've never been born again.

792
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:27,219
They could not say with certainty today

793
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:29,299
that heaven is their home.

794
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,959
They cannot have fellowship with you

795
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:33,879
because they do not have relationship with you.

796
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:36,119
Oh God, I pray that you'd work in their heart and life

797
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,479
that today would be the day of their salvation.

798
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:41,359
For every child of God,

799
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,839
would you help us to have an honest evaluation?

800
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:47,919
Would you help us to evaluate our lives

801
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:50,719
to determine if our fellowship has been hindered?

802
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:52,439
Perhaps there's one that would say,

803
00:51:52,439 --> 00:51:54,819
I know my fellowship is hindered.

804
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:58,239
Oh God, would you help them to just be able to get it right,

805
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,619
to have that restoration?

806
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,779
They've longed for that sweet peace and that rest

807
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:05,839
and they've just struggled.

808
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:11,059
Satan got that toehold that became a stronghold.

809
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:16,179
God, I pray that you'd help each one of us to evaluate

810
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:18,579
and to acknowledge and to confess

811
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:21,259
we might have forgiveness and cleansing.

812
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,339
We thank you so much that you're faithful and just.

813
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,579
We thank you so much that you promised us

814
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,679
that you would forgive us and cleanse us

815
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,819
and how that causes us to rejoice greatly.

816
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,559
John understood what it was to have fellowship with you.

817
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:41,439
God, we desire this morning to have that sweet fellowship,

818
00:52:41,439 --> 00:52:44,199
that sweet communion to walk in the light

819
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,679
as ye are in the light.

820
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:49,319
Work and move as only you can

821
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,119
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

822
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:51,999
Would you stand with me?

823
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,759
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

824
00:52:54,759 --> 00:52:56,119
It's our custom at the end of our service

825
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,459
to have an invitation to invite you to respond.

826
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:00,299
If you're not sure of heaven,

827
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:02,219
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

828
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,819
how you could know for sure that heaven's your home.

829
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,339
If the Holy Spirit of God spoke to your heart

830
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:08,559
in a very specific way this morning,

831
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,059
maybe you need to come to this old fashioned altar and pray.

832
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:15,379
Ask the Lord to help you in whatever area it is

833
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:17,259
that he may have spoken to you.

834
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:19,379
As Kimberly plays, The Altar is Open.

835
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:25,819
â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª
