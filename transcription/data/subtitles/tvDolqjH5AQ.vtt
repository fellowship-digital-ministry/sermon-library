00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
Verses 5 through 10, 1 John 1, verses 5 through 10 on the back of your bulletin this morning,

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:09.239
you see that the title for the message is, God is light.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:10.239
God is light.

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:14.920
We see that in verse number 5, this then is the message which we have heard of him and

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:23.680
declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:30.799
We find that here, the note again, the consistency in which John communicates with those that

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:35.479
he's writing to, of course, for us by way of preservation, the source of his message.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.000
You'll remember at the beginning of verse number 3, it says that which we have seen

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.080
and heard declare we unto you.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.080
And then here in verse number 5, to begin that verse, he says, this then is the message

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.159
that we have heard of him and declare unto you.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.240
Of course, John had the privilege of walking with the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.279
ministry and what a tremendous blessing that was.

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:03.919
And we find that as John is now under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, writing

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:08.599
to these recipients in the first century, and of course, by preservation for us, he's

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.559
helping us to understand that this is the message which we've heard of him and declare

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:13.559
unto you.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:14.559
What is that message?

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:18.400
That God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.919
In fact, it reminds us of what we read in John chapter number 1.

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:24.760
Hold your place here in 1 John.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.879
In turn of the gospel of John, if you will, in John chapter number 1, and you know in

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.959
the gospel of John, we mentioned last week how that there's great similarity between

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:41.360
the opening of John, the gospel of John, and the epistle, 1 John, with regard to just getting

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360
right at it.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.879
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and just

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:50.760
right out of the chute, a hundred miles an hour, if you will, and just proving the deity

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.599
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.239
We find that now in verse number 5, he begins to deal with the subject of light, just as

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.720
he does in 1 John chapter number 1 and verse number 5 as well.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.680
Notice in verse number 4, in him was life and the life was the light of men and the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.240
light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not or comprehended it not.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.479
There was a man sent from God whose name was John, that speaking of John the Baptist,

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:22.759
not the apostle John, it says in verse number 7, the same came for a witness to bear witness

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:28.240
of the light that all men through him might believe.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.039
He, John the Baptist, was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.320
That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.160
He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.639
And we find again, as John begins in 1 John chapter number 1, this is the message that

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.639
we have heard of him in declaring to you, what is that message?

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.039
That God is light and in him is no darkness at all.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:07.720
We find that this contrast of light and darkness is revealed to us in the first chapter of

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.080
this epistle.

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.639
In fact, you will find many contrasts within the book of 1 John.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.679
This is just one of them, light and darkness.

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:21.479
We find that there are many references to light and darkness throughout the remainder

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:27.240
of the epistle of 1 John, but this is not a contrast that is exclusive to the book of

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240
1 John.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.919
In fact, as you read the entirety of the New Testament, you'll find many references in

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.800
contrasting the truth of light versus darkness.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.039
The initial understanding is dealt with with regard to salvation.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.880
Darkness would be representative of being lost of our condition before we trust that

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.279
Christ as our Savior were in darkness and light would be that individual that has been

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.720
saved that is in Christ.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.320
And that's the understanding, if you will, one of the applications with regard to light

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.000
versus darkness, lost versus saved, or I should say saved, light versus darkness, lost.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.040
And we find that throughout the word of God, Ephesians chapter number five mentions it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.480
this way in Ephesians five and verse number eight.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.399
And we spoke about several references of the book of Ephesians to begin our study through

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.760
1 John with regard to the walk of a believer.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.640
But I want you to notice what it says in Ephesians five and verse number eight.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.519
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.239
Walk as children of light.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:48.399
So what you were, darkness, you were lost, unregenerate, you wereâ€¦that was your condition,

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.320
but now are ye light in the Lord.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.359
It says this, that we're to walk as children of light.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:01.959
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number five, we find that to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:08.000
this same truth, the contrast is given where he talks about the fact that we are the children

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.359
of light, not of darkness.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:15.920
And again, the understanding of salvation, he deals with it in 1 Peter chapter number

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920
two.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.519
In fact, I know that on a Wednesday evening, this passage of scripture was referenced in

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.040
1 Peter chapter number two.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.880
In verse number nine, the Bible says, but you're a chosen generation, a royal priesthood

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.480
and holy nation, a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:42.600
Notice this, who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.720
And so we understand the truth of the word of God with regard to this contrast that immediately

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.239
it's referring to light and darkness, salvation and lost, our condition before the Lord.

00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:01.799
But we also understand that we are commissioned as we find in verse number seven of 1 John

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:06.600
one, but the truth of walking in the light, it's our theme for the year.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.059
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:15.679
in the blood of Jesus Christ, his son cleanseth us from all sin.

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:21.440
Therefore, there's an understanding of this light versus darkness of walking in fellowship

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.160
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.880
Because I am in the light, because I've been born again, that initial truth of light versus

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.000
darkness.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.839
Now I can walk in the light and have that fellowship with the Lord.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.640
Paul says this to the believers in Corinth.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640
You don't need to turn there.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.839
But at the end of verse number 14 of second Corinthians six, he asked this question, what

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:48.160
communion hath light with darkness?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.880
And we find that as we look at this passage of scripture and understand what's taking

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.000
place, again, the truth that was revealed to us in the first four verses in the introduction

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.119
last week, with regard to the reason of the writing, obviously, we talked about that your

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:09.160
joy may be full in one way to have our joy full, really, we looked at the two ways.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.200
One is knowing that you're saved.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.239
But number two is walking in fellowship.

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:20.880
When I'm out of fellowship with the Lord, my joy is affected, it's impacted.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.079
What is it that can steal my joy?

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.679
The reality is that no man can steal my joy.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:29.239
The devil can't steal your joy, and I'm thankful for that.

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:36.440
But the reality is that sin robs us of the joy of our salvation, and our fellowship with

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.760
the Lord is hindered.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.640
As we look at this passage of scripture, if you're taking notes, notice number one, the

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.179
blessedness of fellowship.

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:47.420
We really see this in verse five, and then in verse number seven.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.720
We see this blessedness of fellowship.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.880
I would say this, that John was faithful to deliver the message that he'd been given.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.200
We note that in the beginning of verse number five, when he says, this then is the message

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.839
which we have heard of him and declare unto you.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:06.000
Aren't you thankful for faithful messengers, faithful servants of the Lord?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
We find that he has received the message, and now he's distributing the message.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.760
He, John, knew what it was to personally walk with God.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:23.040
He knew what it was to walk with the Lord on this earth, physically in his presence.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.000
But then you think about after the ascension, this letter of 1 John is written many years

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.760
after the ascension of Jesus Christ.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.340
And so John has now learned not only what it was to physically walk with the Lord during

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.619
his earthly ministry, but now to walk with the Lord even after the Lord has ascended

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:44.960
up into heaven.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:50.039
Now think about the transition for the disciples, the apostles, that did in fact walk with the

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:55.159
Lord Jesus Christ, but then before the ascension in Acts chapter number one, they watched the

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:57.679
Lord Jesus Christ ascend up into heaven.

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.979
Man, that was a great change for them.

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:05.880
They were called out of whatever field they were in, whatever their occupation was, they

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.200
were saved and they became followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.119
And they walked with him and they saw the miracles and they slept where he slept and

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:18.960
they ate where he ate and they did all of these things and they walked with him physically

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.840
in his presence and then the presence is removed as far as physically speaking, but now they're

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.320
walking with the Lord the same way in which we walk with the Lord.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.400
And that's a precious truth and we find that John is seeking to communicate this truth

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.039
to us under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God with regard to fellowship.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:45.700
Of course, when we speak about the blessedness of fellowship, I am so thankful that the God

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.460
of the universe, the God of heaven has an interest in having fellowship with me.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.700
Does that not blow your mind?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:00.700
When you understand who God is, when you understand how great our God is, when you understand

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.460
understand that He's in control of everything,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.340
He's created everything,

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.240
and that He would be interested in you,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.640
in me, to have fellowship with us.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.640
There are some people on the face of this earth

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.120
that are important, powerful people

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.220
from the world's perspective.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.120
And they would not give you one second of their time.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.960
Right?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.460
They don't know you.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.560
They don't have any interest in having

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.260
any kind of communication with you.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.220
But the God of the universe,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.100
the omnipotent, almighty God of the universe,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.740
He desires to have fellowship with us.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.740
And what is it that enables that fellowship?

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.500
We dealt with it in our very first message,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.740
introductory message to this study

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.300
through the book of 1 John.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.220
And we said this, that fellowship requires relationship.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.080
Fellowship requires relationship.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.780
I cannot have fellowship with the Lord

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.380
if I do not belong to Him,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.180
if I've not been saved,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.280
if I've not trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.020
We find that in verse number two,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.440
remember one of those subjects

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.680
that He was going to deal with

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.620
as we spoke about the content

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.020
of this witness that is provided to us

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.680
was that of eternal life.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.660
The source of eternal life is the Lord.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.260
And we understand it's through the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.000
And when we have that relationship,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.460
when I belong to Him, He belongs to me,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.900
He's my Father, I'm His child,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.800
that relationship now enables fellowship.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.300
I cannot have fellowship with Him

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.540
if I do not belong to Him.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.500
And I only can belong to Him

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.700
is if I come through the blood.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.780
There's only one way to approach the Lord,

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.040
and it's through the blood.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.440
It's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.180
Remember what Jesus said in John 14,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.240
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.280
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.620
There's only one way to have access to God,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.980
and that's through the Son,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.420
through the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.340
We see that in verse number seven.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.180
Notice the Bible says, but if we walk in the light

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.620
as He is in the light, because He is light,

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.300
and in Him is no darkness at all,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.360
it's already been settled in verse number five.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.560
Notice we have fellowship one with another,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.200
and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.360
cleanseth us from all sin.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.080
I'm so thankful to be saved.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.140
I'm so thankful to be forgiven.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.300
But that forgiveness leads to not only eternal life

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.340
and the truth with regard to my eternal destiny,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.840
but it also leads to having fellowship with God,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.980
and that sweet communion with the Lord.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.940
The fact that we can commune with Him,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.420
that I can speak to Him.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.480
I can enter into a time of prayer and seek His face.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.220
I can take this precious book, the Bible,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.900
and I can sit and I can read

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.900
and learn the mind of the Lord,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.060
and He speaks to me through His word,

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.920
and what a blessing that is.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.460
And we think about the blessedness of salvation,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.400
and we understand that a fellowship,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.580
the blessedness of fellowship,

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.020
and that this is only possible because we are saved.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.220
The content of this section of 1 John

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.220
addresses the blessedness of fellowship,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.780
but then really focuses upon the hindrance to fellowship,

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.480
and then how to have that hindered fellowship restored.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.620
So number two in your notes,

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.080
if you are taking notes this morning,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.800
I want you to notice the hindrance to fellowship.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.480
We've mentioned the blessedness of fellowship,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.840
and I'm thankful for it,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.200
but we understand that though we have been saved

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.740
and though we have a relationship with the Lord,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.080
and I'm His and He is mine,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.220
and what a blessed truth that is,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.280
we understand biblically that my fellowship can be hindered.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.800
We mentioned this last week

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.160
as we spoke about relationships on this earth.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.520
We spoke about a relationship between a husband and a wife,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.640
between a parent and a child,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.880
and those relationships are understood,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.280
and we understand those relationships,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.400
but we also understand that the fellowship

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.240
in those relationships can be hindered.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.120
There are parents and children

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.480
that unfortunately are not in good fellowship

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.960
one with another.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.640
Oh, they have a relationship.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.800
It's still the father, it's still the mother,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.080
it's still the son or the daughter.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.200
There's a relationship that is there,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.740
but the fellowship has been hindered.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.440
The fellowship is not what it's been designed to be,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.800
and we find that there can be hindrance in our lives

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.480
and our fellowship with the Lord,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.840
and we see this really in verses six, eight, and 10,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.420
the even verses here in our passage of scripture

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.559
that we're looking at this morning.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:42.140
We see what it is that would be a hindrance

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.040
to our fellowship.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.000
In one word, we'd say sins,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.400
and we find that in verse number six, eight, and 10,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.360
it's very interesting that each of these verses

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.760
begin with this phrase, if we say.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.040
Isn't that interesting?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.400
If we say.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.720
The reality is that you can say anything,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.960
and I can say anything,

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:05.200
and what we find in these verses of scripture

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.960
is what we claim versus what we really are.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.200
By the way, we see that in Revelation three

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.520
with the church of the Laodiceans.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.880
We see that they say they have an opinion,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.480
they have a perspective as to their condition,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.260
but God says something entirely different

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.480
about their condition.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.480
In fact, what they really were

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.040
had hindered their fellowship with God.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.080
How do we know that?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.400
Well, because in Revelation three in verse number 20,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.000
it says, behold, I stand at the door and knock,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.279
and if any man will open, I will enter,

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.040
and I will sup with him, right?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.640
That fellowship with him that is possible,

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.520
and we know that that fellowship is hindered,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.040
and here we see three occasions, verse six, eight, and 10,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.040
where the Bible speaks about this hindered fellowship,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.440
and we notice that it begins with if we say.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.440
Notice what it said in verse number six.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.480
If we say that we have fellowship with him,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.700
and yet we walk in darkness,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.700
we lie and do not the truth.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.559
If we say that we have fellowship with him

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:17.559
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.200
We find in verse number eight, notice what we say.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.920
If we say that we have no sin,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.920
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.880
Do you see in verse number six, it says that we lie.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.000
If we say that we have fellowship,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.559
but we walk in darkness, we lie.

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:41.800
But now in verse number eight,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.080
if we say that we have no sin,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.040
notice what he says, we deceive ourselves.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.480
When we lie, typically, if you lie,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.820
if someone lies to you, they're trying to deceive you, right?

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.640
If I lie to you, it's because I'm trying to deceive you.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.200
If you lie to me, it's because you're trying to deceive me.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.800
Is that fair?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.200
And we find here, however, notice the progression

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.720
that if we say that we have fellowship with him,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.600
but we're walking in darkness, we lie,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.000
and we do not the truth.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.720
Or, and then we find in verse number eight,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.920
he says, if we say that we have no sin,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.760
notice we deceive ourselves.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.480
No longer are we deceiving someone else

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.040
because of our lying,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.600
but now our lying is deceiving ourselves.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.559
Self-deception, I've said over the years,

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:31.460
is the worst form of deception.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.779
It's one thing to be deceived by someone else,

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:40.180
but it's a far worse thing to be deceived by yourself,

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.140
to think that you're something that you're not.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.320
You've pretended for so long, you've lied for so long,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.260
that you've deceived yourself.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.260
Notice what he says, and the truth is not in us.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.540
Notice verse number 10.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.940
If we say, again, we notice the approach

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.260
and we notice the claim, notice here,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.260
that we have not sinned, we make him a liar.

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:09.880
Who's the him?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.720
That's God.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.680
Wow.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.360
This is a serious progression, is it not?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.740
If we say that we have fellowship with him

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.740
and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.380
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.300
and the truth is not in us.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.299
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.460
and his word is not in us.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.760
Can I tell you this morning that God is not a liar?

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.179
Amen?

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:45.660
God has said, for all have sinned

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.820
and come short of the glory of God.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.100
There's not a just man, a righteous man,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.020
that walketh upon the face of the earth,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.580
and we understand here that he says,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.900
here's what you're saying.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.780
You're saying that you're walking in fellowship,

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.739
but you're actually walking in darkness.

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:00.900
You say that you have no sin.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.540
You're deceiving yourselves.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.980
You say that you've not sinned,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.220
and you're making him a liar.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.980
There's also a similarity between each of these verses.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.559
We note what is said.

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:10.580
We note the claim.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.780
We note the progression of we lie, we deceive ourselves,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.780
we make him a liar, but I want you to also reference,

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.700
did you see, did you note,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.580
as we've looked at these verses of Scripture,

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.020
the reference to God's word in each verse?

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:26.040
What is the reference in verse number six?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.340
We do not the truth.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.900
What is the truth?

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.700
Thy word is truth.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.059
Is that not what John 17 says?

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:37.739
Thy word is truth, and so we note that it says

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.900
that we do not the truth.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.859
Notice in verse number 18, at the end of the verse,

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:47.260
and the truth is not in us.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.260
Notice in verse number 10 that his word is not in us.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.380
An absence of truth is directly linked

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.299
to hindered fellowship in this portion of Scripture.

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:01.260
It was D.L. Moody that said many years ago.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.100
He made the statement, I read it and I've repeated it many times over the years, that

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:14.100
sin will keep you from this book, or this book will keep you from sin.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.660
And the reality is what we find here in 1 John, in the first chapter in verse 6, 8,

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.420
and 10, when we think about this hindered fellowship, we note that there's an absence

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.140
of the Word of God, the truth, it says that we do not the truth, we're not doers of

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.140
the Word.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.460
1 John speaks about the importance of being doers of the Word and not hearers only, that

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.140
we're not applying truth in our life.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.220
We say in verse number 8 and again in verse number 10 that His Word, His truth is not

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.420
in us.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.820
Well then we find that there's a great secret that is revealed here to us in this portion

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.540
of Scripture and that is the importance, the place that God's Word would serve in our lives,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.700
to help us remain in fellowship with Him.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.580
Think about the truth, turn to 2 Timothy chapter number 3 if you will, and consider

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.220
the truth that is before us with regard to what is said about the Word of God in this

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.860
portion of Scripture.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.460
When you think about the hindered fellowship, the hindrance to fellowship that is mentioned

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.420
in 1 John chapter number 1, and you notice what is said, but you notice that there's

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:27.300
an absence of truth in this link between the absence of truth to hindered fellowship.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.100
In 2 Timothy chapter number 3 in verse number 16, a familiar verse of Scripture, the Bible

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.580
says this, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.660
It says this, and is profitable.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.940
I'm thankful that God gave us His Word, inspiration, God breathed.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.100
We notice that He mentions in verse number 15 that from a child thou hast known the Holy

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.100
Scriptures.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.940
He'd be referring to the Old Testament.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.620
The New Testament's not yet completed at this time.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.660
But He says that all Scripture, the entirety of it, every part of it is given by inspiration

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.700
of God, and it is profitable.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.260
What is it profitable for?

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:10.620
Well, it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.020
And we find that the Word of God is profitable to us, yes, for doctrine, for our beliefs,

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:22.380
for that body of doctrine that we hold dear, the faith as it's referred to by Jude that

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.380
we're to earnestly contend for the faith.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.900
But you notice the phraseology of for reproof and for correction.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.660
The fact that there are times in which we're wrong and we need to be reproved.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.860
There are times in which we need to be corrected, that the Word of God, as we get into the Word

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.860
of God, as we study the Word of God, as we apply the Word of God, the Word of God will

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.460
correct us.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.260
It will show us where we're wrong in our thinking.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.100
It'll show us where we're wrong in our actions.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.380
And when we find that we go to the Word of God, it not only is profitable for doctrine,

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.500
for reproof, for correction, but for instruction in righteousness.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.700
It teaches us how to live a life that is pleasing to God.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.580
It teaches us what God is pleased with and what God is not pleased with.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.900
How is it that we would know that I have...

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.380
Well, let me just give you this.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.740
Turn to Romans chapter number 7.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.780
Look at this passage of Scripture because Paul testifies of himself here with regard

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:25.060
to this truth of how sin is revealed to us through the Word of God.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:31.940
There are people, very few people, that I've ever met that have denied ever sinning.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.100
There's just been a couple of people that I've ever met that I've asked them, have you

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.100
ever sinned?

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.100
And they say, no, not me.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.900
I'm like, man, we got some work to do here, man, because I am sure that I can show you

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.820
that you've sinned, amen?

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.080
And we try to get into it.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.540
But let me say this.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.420
We know that to be the truth, and of us that are sitting here this morning, I think most

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.740
of us would say readily, yes, we acknowledge sin.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.380
We understand that there's sins in our lives.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.220
I said this as I was preaching through the book of Colossians last year when we dealt

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.060
with the sins of a believer, and there was this reference of this interaction between

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.100
the preacher and one of the church members, and the church members said to the preacher,

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.100
I don't understand why you're preaching about sins in the life of believers.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.339
Don't you understand that sin in the life of a believer is different than sin in the

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:19.180
life of an unbeliever?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.540
The preacher said, yeah, it's worse.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.680
That's really true.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.660
But here's the problem sometimes in our lives.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.300
If we say what we're looking at here, this hindrance to fellowship, you know what happens

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.300
sometimes?

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.380
We'll get to our point in just a moment as we finish up the message this morning of confession

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.100
and having that restoration, but we say something like this, Father, if we've sinned, what do

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.779
you mean if?

00:24:45.779 --> 00:24:47.339
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:48.860
But sometimes that's how we pray.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.900
What do you mean if we have sinned?

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.540
There's a testimony of a preacher that was working with someone in a, it was like a tent

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.339
meeting situation, and this man, man, he heard the preaching of the Word of God, and there

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:02.380
was this, it was kind of a citywide crusade.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.180
There were many churches that were represented, a lot of lost people there.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.180
People were getting saved.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.420
People were getting right with God, and this man comes to the aisle, and he's dealing with

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.540
this local pastor in this area where this tent meeting is, and the man is just, he's

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:19.059
just, man, God just worked in my heart through this message, and I'm just, I got so many

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:22.339
things going on in my life, and this, that, and the other thing, and blah, blah, blah,

00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:26.779
and he goes through, and let's pray, and let's get this thing straightened out, and he begins

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:30.059
with what I just said, if I have sinned.

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:35.020
And the preacher stopped him and said, no, no, no, you just told me that you have.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:40.020
So now, why, when you pray to God, are you saying, if we have sinned, or I have sinned?

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.540
And the reality is that, look at what Paul says in Romans 7.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.339
In verse number 7, he says this, what shall we say then?

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:48.779
Is the law sin?

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:49.779
God forbid.

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:58.020
Notice what he says, nay, I had not known sin, but by the law, for I had not known lust,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.140
except the law had said, thou shalt not covet, right?

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:11.460
And so, when we understand, listen again, the absence of truth in verse 6, 8, and 10

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.380
is a direct link to hindered fellowship.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.940
The sins that would hinder the fellowship, the absence of the Word of God, you do not

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.339
the truth, the truth is not in us, His Word is not in us.

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:30.740
And when we get the Word of God, and we begin to study the Word of God, and we regularly

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.860
feast upon the Word of God, you know what God's Word does?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.660
It confronts us about our sins.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.220
The closer you get to the light, the more you see the sins, right?

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.020
That's how it works.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.460
You say, man, I feel like the closer I get to God, the more He reveals.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.460
Yeah.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.180
You ever see those?

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.660
I've never used one.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.180
I've seen them.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.540
But ladies have these makeup mirrors, right, 35X, lights all around them.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.460
I remember as a child sitting in my grandmother, my mom's mom, sitting in her kitchen, and

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.619
she would get her makeup on, and it was a process.

00:27:11.619 --> 00:27:12.619
I'm serious.

00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:15.300
I mean, it was like, it was a process.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.619
And she'd bring this light out, and I mean, all these, back then there were no LEDs, right,

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:21.460
all these light bulbs around this thing.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.660
It looked like, I don't even know what it looked like, it was kind of a weird little

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.220
deal with a mirror in the middle, all these lights.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.980
And I remember sitting there, I was probably seven or eight years old.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.779
I called her my mom, that was what we referred to her as, and I said, my mom, why do you

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:34.779
use that?

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.180
She said, well, all these lights show the imperfections.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.140
She said, so I know where I have to put the makeup.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.660
That's what she said to me.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:48.220
Now, all these years later, not just now, but several years ago, I wasn't saved at the

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.860
time, didn't go to church at that time, but when I read 1 John, I was beginning to realize

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.779
the truth of what she told me as a child with regard to her makeup mirror with all these

00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:04.380
lights, and the spiritual truth that the closer I get to the light, God is light, and in Him

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:09.820
is no darkness at all, that all of a sudden that light starts shining and revealing sins

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.820
in my life.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.900
There's been a time when you're walking with Christ, and you're like, man, I didn't even

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.980
realize that was, I didn't realize I was doing that, I didn't realize it was wrong, I didn't

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:23.460
realize, and God's Word confronts us with sins, and as we're confronted with sins, we

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.140
better deal with sins, amen?

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.380
There were sins of commission and sins of omission in the Old Testament that are dealt

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.179
with, and we understand that, but here, as we look at this portion of Scripture, and

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:41.559
we really look at the hypocrisy in verses 6, 8, and 10, we look at the self-deception,

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:46.820
we look at the individual that is kind of above the situation, and they've gotten into

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.979
this position where now they have this hindered fellowship.

00:28:51.979 --> 00:28:58.100
As we look at the passage of Scripture back in 1 John chapter number 1, we note the blessedness

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:04.619
of fellowship, we note the hindrance to fellowship, but I want you to focus on verse number 9

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:10.960
with me as we conclude this morning and look at the restoration of fellowship, the restoration

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960
of fellowship.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:19.479
I'm so thankful that hindered fellowship doesn't have to remain hindered fellowship.

00:29:19.479 --> 00:29:24.200
I'm thankful that there's a way back to God, amen?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.559
And the way back to God isn't that you have to get saved again.

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:32.119
Salvation, being born again, is a one-time event in your life.

00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:37.440
It's a time in which you understand that you are on your way to hell because of your sin,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.600
you're on your way to the lake of fire, and that you're a sinner and that you're guilty

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.119
and that Jesus Christ is the only Savior, and you place your faith and trust in Jesus

00:29:45.119 --> 00:29:51.600
Christ alone for your salvation, and He gives you the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.160
And you shall never perish and no man shall ever pluck you out of the Father's hand.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.359
We are kept by the power of God.

00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:01.239
But when our fellowship is hindered, how do we have it restored?

00:30:01.239 --> 00:30:04.199
The restoration of fellowship is dealt with in verse number nine.

00:30:04.199 --> 00:30:06.519
I want to ask you this. Look at verse number nine.

00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:14.159
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:17.959
unrighteousness. Now, isn't that a precious verse of Scripture?

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:22.839
It is a verse of Scripture in which many of us have committed to memory.

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:28.999
We find that in this verse of Scripture, I wonder if you noted the sins

00:30:29.639 --> 00:30:31.639
plural in verse number nine,

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:39.239
versus the sin in verse number seven and eight that is referenced as being singular. At the end of verse number seven,

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:41.879
notice the Bible says in the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,

00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:46.359
cleanseth us from all sin.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:50.439
In verse number eight, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

00:30:50.439 --> 00:30:55.159
The truth is not in us, but notice what he says in verse number nine. If we confess our sins,

00:30:55.679 --> 00:31:00.279
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. I want to be careful.

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:03.439
I hope to explain this in such a way that there's no confusion.

00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:09.079
And I know on Wednesday evening, Jeff did a great job dealing with some of this with regard to the offerings.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:13.039
And when he spoke about the offerings, he talked about what enabled fellowship,

00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:17.239
but then also what maintains fellowship. If you didn't hear that on Wednesday night,

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:21.479
we'll make sure that we get you a copy. But it was a great message that he shared on Wednesday evening.

00:31:21.639 --> 00:31:27.079
I appreciated it. As we look at this contrast in sins versus sin, I want you to think about it this way.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:32.679
Sin would really be representative of our condition, what we are. We're sinners.

00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:37.359
Right? We sin because we're sinners.

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:40.159
Right? That's why we sin.

00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:44.879
It's not that we become sinners because we sin, for we know that we're born sinners.

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:47.799
Right? You don't have to teach a child to do wrong.

00:31:47.879 --> 00:31:49.879
You don't have to teach a child to sin.

00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:55.959
Everyone that's had a toddler understands that and says, where did this kid get this from? He's got a sin nature.

00:31:56.679 --> 00:32:01.979
Right? Now there are some things that they learn, no doubt, but they have a sin nature.

00:32:03.559 --> 00:32:08.759
Sins, if we think about it plural in verse number nine, is what we do. It's our conduct.

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:11.879
Now think about it this way.

00:32:11.879 --> 00:32:15.799
It's my sins that hinder my fellowship with the Lord.

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:20.199
Sin has been dealt with. Remember, John is writing here to believers.

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:28.919
He's writing to those that have trusted Christ as their Savior, that have the privilege of fellowship because they've been born again.

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:33.879
That privilege of fellowship with God is reserved to the child of God.

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:40.039
And as we think about that privilege of fellowship that has been reserved to the child of God,

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:47.479
we note that that same fellowship that is a privilege to every child of God can be hindered because of our sins.

00:32:48.439 --> 00:32:51.719
And if my sins hinder my fellowship with God,

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:58.699
how is it that I can have that fellowship restored? I would say that it begins with this. Number one, with an honest evaluation.

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:01.559
With an honest evaluation.

00:33:01.639 --> 00:33:08.699
Looking into the perfect law of liberty. That's what is said in James chapter number one, in verse number 25,

00:33:09.179 --> 00:33:12.139
James calls the word of God the perfect law of liberty.

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:16.059
And I want you to think about what he says in this passage of scripture.

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.899
He talks about being doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving our own selves.

00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:22.379
But he says this in verse 25 of James one,

00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:29.519
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein,

00:33:29.979 --> 00:33:35.419
he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

00:33:35.739 --> 00:33:39.599
I believe that as we look at our lives in this honest evaluation,

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:44.799
it must be that we go to the word of God. We look into the perfect law of liberty.

00:33:45.499 --> 00:33:52.779
If I'm going to determine how my fellowship has been hindered with my God and how my sins have hindered my fellowship with God,

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:58.779
it's not that I'm going to compare my life with Michael's life or Michael's going to compare his life with Ryan's life

00:33:58.939 --> 00:34:03.499
and try to determine, well, I'm better than he is. No, no, we look into the perfect law of liberty.

00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:07.979
And as we look into the perfect law of liberty and as we ask God,

00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:10.619
show me, Lord, from your word,

00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:12.059
things

00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:14.459
that I'm not doing that I need to be doing.

00:34:14.859 --> 00:34:21.019
Show me, reveal to me the things that I'm doing that I need not to be doing. Reveal to me the sins

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.160
in my life that need to be addressed.

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:31.019
Oftentimes, even as we mentioned the book of Colossians, as we preached last year through that book,

00:34:31.339 --> 00:34:37.500
many times the people of God don't care much when you're preaching about murder and you're preaching about

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:44.699
these great sins and say, man, I'm not guilty of murder. I'm not guilty of adultery. That's wonderful.

00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:47.339
But what about gossip?

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:52.220
We don't like hearing preaching about gossip. You know why? A lot of us are guilty.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.500
And we just don't like it, right?

00:34:56.459 --> 00:34:58.539
Now, I'm not going to go through a whole list this morning,

00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:02.639
but the reality is that when I read the word of God in its entirety

00:35:03.099 --> 00:35:10.139
and I ask God to show me, to reveal to me, all of a sudden He begins to reveal to me sins in my life

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.380
that are hindering my fellowship.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.380
If you feel like your fellowship is hindered, sometimes maybe in a relationship, maybe husband and wife,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.940
something's happening, you just feel like, man,

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.380
it seems like my wife's been a little bit cold to me or seems like my husband's a little cold to me.

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:28.859
Something seems wrong. Do we just kind of go about our day and say, well, it's just as what it is?

00:35:29.259 --> 00:35:31.819
No, I hope that you at least say, hey, did I do something?

00:35:32.539 --> 00:35:34.539
Did I say something?

00:35:34.539 --> 00:35:38.699
And then maybe you find out that they just weren't feeling well, or maybe you did do something.

00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:43.500
Well, actually, since you asked, and then you say, man, I shouldn't have asked. I'm just teasing.

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:48.859
But the reality is that, listen, why would we say something like that? Why? Because we want the fellowship

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:52.380
we should desire to have that fellowship restored

00:35:53.179 --> 00:35:55.179
with our spouse,

00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:57.979
parent, and a child. But what about with our God?

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:01.179
I don't want to walk through life

00:36:01.899 --> 00:36:03.899
with hindered fellowship.

00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:08.139
No, I want to be in sweet communion with my God.

00:36:09.579 --> 00:36:11.679
And there must be an honest evaluation.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:18.380
We mention as we preach and talk about the Lord's Supper in 1 Corinthians 11, if a man examined himself,

00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:20.559
but let a man examine himself.

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:27.599
That is a serious process. It is a sobering process to take the Word of God and say, God, show me,

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:32.479
reveal to me, search me, O God.

00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:36.639
Not somebody else,

00:36:36.799 --> 00:36:40.319
but me, because I'm concerned about my walk with you.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.479
I'm concerned about my fellowship with you. So, it begins with an honest evaluation. It must have,

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:52.720
after the honest evaluation, there must be, number two, an acknowledgement of sins.

00:36:53.759 --> 00:36:58.479
Understand with me this morning that you're never going to confess your sins if you don't acknowledge your sins.

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:02.239
You're just not going to. You're not going to think there's anything that you need to confess,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.679
because you've not had the honest evaluation. There's not been an acknowledgement of sins.

00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:10.479
Sometimes when there's

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.720
a service, whether it's

00:37:13.279 --> 00:37:18.000
me as the pastor preaching, whether it's a missionary that's preaching or an evangelist that's preaching,

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:20.799
sometimes there's a message that's preached on sins,

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:24.959
and people shy away from going forward because they don't want to,

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:27.599
I don't want anyone to think that I'm a sinner. We already know you are.

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:33.279
Right?

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:36.799
Do you understand what I'm saying? We already know. We know what we are.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.679
We're sinners.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:41.359
Saved by grace,

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.880
heaven-bound,

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.880
but we're not perfect.

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:51.919
And there ought not be any judgment. Man, I rejoice with my brother or sister that's having their fellowship restored.

00:37:52.799 --> 00:37:54.639
Amen?

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:58.559
It should cause us to rejoice greatly. It should not cause us, listen,

00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:01.919
can I tell you a sin that you're dealing with if you won't want to go get it right? Pride.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.880
I don't want anyone to think I'm a sinner. We already know.

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.079
And now pride is hindering your fellowship even more.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.079
Right?

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:15.039
And so we look at this passage, we say, listen, there must be an acknowledgement. Every single person is impacted.

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:17.759
I understand that there was teaching from years gone by,

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:25.119
from certain groups of people that would teach and believe and peddle their ideas that you could reach in this life a place of

00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:28.639
sinless perfection. I do not find it within the Word of God.

00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:35.059
I reach a place of sinless perfection when this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:40.339
when this corruption shall put on incorruption. And that's not going to happen until I go to be with the Lord.

00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:44.260
Amen? And you have flesh and I have flesh.

00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:47.219
And the devil is the tempter,

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:48.419
right?

00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:51.940
He's shooting all of his fiery darts. He's trying to tempt us. He's trying to hinder us.

00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:54.820
He's trying to to destroy us, to devour us.

00:38:54.979 --> 00:39:00.899
And we find that there must be an acknowledgement of sins. And then comes the verse, verse number nine, if we confess

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.539
our sins,

00:39:03.919 --> 00:39:05.859
confession of sins, number three in our list,

00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:11.140
there's an honest evaluation followed by an acknowledgement of sins that leads to a confession of sins.

00:39:11.859 --> 00:39:15.380
We must refuse to cover or to excuse our sins.

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:22.760
God begins to deal with an individual with regard to their temper. Well, you know, it's because of my ancestry.

00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:25.700
I'm of this particular, you know,

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.000
background, trying to be politically correct, and we're just known for our tempers.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.700
No, no, you're a sinner.

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:38.979
Right?

00:39:38.979 --> 00:39:41.080
And sometimes we excuse our behavior.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:45.700
Well, if that person didn't do, hold on, that person doesn't control you.

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.739
Right? I wouldn't have done that if they didn't. Ah, stop.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.700
Do you know what the word confess means?

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:55.779
It literally means to say the same thing of.

00:39:57.299 --> 00:40:01.219
It's not this idea of, Lord, I confess all my sins. No, no, it's a lot more.

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:08.659
specific than that. A lot more specific. God, in that situation, I lied. I did not tell the truth.

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:14.259
And God, I know that that's wicked. You said that you hate lying lips. All of a sudden,

00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:20.499
it gets real when we start praying that way. Right? And we say, God, that was not right.

00:40:21.859 --> 00:40:27.699
Would you forgive me for that? Cleanse me from that. Help me to have victory over that in my

00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:34.899
life. And we call sin what it is. So often in our lives today, we try to sugarcoat sin.

00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:42.659
It's not to be sugarcoated. It is what caused Jesus Christ to go to the cross of Calvary.

00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:49.299
Right? And when we understand that, listen, in the Old Testament, there were offerings that

00:40:49.299 --> 00:40:55.299
had to be brought. If we had to bring an offering every time, it'd be a lot different.

00:40:56.259 --> 00:41:05.059
I'm glad that we live when we live. Okay? But you understand there was a great awareness of sins

00:41:06.179 --> 00:41:10.739
under the Old Testament law. Because every time you turn around, there's an offering that has

00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:16.739
to be brought. And as New Testament believers, sometimes we don't have that same awareness of

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:22.099
sins in our lives. Why? Because we just kind of are going through life. We're just going

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:26.819
through the motions. We're saying that we have fellowship with God, but we're actually walking

00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:34.979
in darkness. We find that it says this, this confession of sins, refusing to cover, refusing

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:44.419
to excuse our sins. Notice it says, if we confess our sins, this is precious. He is faithful and

00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:55.779
just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The cleansing from sins,

00:41:56.819 --> 00:42:04.179
the reason that He cleanses us from sin is because He is faithful and He is just.

00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:07.219
It's interesting to me, we sang two songs today,

00:42:08.179 --> 00:42:13.779
Grace, Greater Than Our Sin, and then we sang Great is Thy Faithfulness.

00:42:14.819 --> 00:42:19.779
How perfect those two songs fit with this message this morning. I don't pick the songs,

00:42:19.779 --> 00:42:24.099
Dean does. They don't always line up exactly like they have this morning,

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:28.019
but it's always precious when it does that. You see the hand of God in that.

00:42:29.939 --> 00:42:35.219
The update letter that Michael provided us an update of, I really hesitated on giving him

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:40.419
that letter on Wednesday because of the subject matter and what it dealt with. Maybe that's not

00:42:40.419 --> 00:42:44.739
a good update letter to give on a Sunday morning, a missionary that has to deal with sins in the

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:49.299
church and church discipline and getting all this kind of thing. The Holy Spirit of God said,

00:42:49.299 --> 00:42:53.459
don't you remember what you're preaching on Sunday morning? That is exactly the update

00:42:53.459 --> 00:42:59.219
letter that needs to be given because sin in the life of a believer is a bad deal.

00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:05.059
I'm thankful that I'm heaven bound, but I don't want my fellowship to be hindered.

00:43:05.059 --> 00:43:12.259
I'm thankful that God is faithful and just. He's righteous. He always does what He says

00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:16.579
He will do. This is a great promise. I mentioned this morning in our Sunday school hour how that

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:21.459
He is ready to pardon, ready to forgive, and what a blessing that is. It says that He forgives us

00:43:21.459 --> 00:43:27.859
of our sins, and it says that He cleanses us from all unrighteousness. What a blessing.

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:34.019
Proverbs 28 and verse 13 says that He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:41.459
There's no prospering in covering our sin because the reality is that when we, when I,

00:43:41.459 --> 00:43:48.179
or when you cover our sin, we're only covering it from each other, but God already knows about it.

00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:53.939
Right? And what really matters, that I look good to you, that you look good to me,

00:43:53.939 --> 00:43:59.619
or that our walk with God is what it ought to be. Right? That's really what matters.

00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:05.779
In Proverbs 28, 13, He that cover the sins shall not prosper, notice, but whoso confesseth

00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:12.899
and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Wow. I'm so thankful for the mercy of God.

00:44:12.899 --> 00:44:17.379
I'll give you an assignment this evening since we're not having church, John 13. I was planning

00:44:17.379 --> 00:44:21.139
to spend more time here, but I'm just going to mention a couple of things in John 13.

00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:26.259
I think it's a great picture if you have just a moment to turn there. In John 13 verses 3 through

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:32.019
10, we think about this forgiveness, this cleansing that is mentioned in 1 John 1 and verse

00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:38.179
number 9, and we notice in John 13, if you're familiar, as soon as I said John 13, some of you

00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:41.939
already knew that it's dealing with the time in which the Lord Jesus Christ washed the feet of

00:44:41.939 --> 00:44:47.699
the disciples. I won't have the time to develop all the thought that I wanted to develop this

00:44:47.699 --> 00:44:52.659
morning from this passage of Scripture in closing, but I think it's a great picture of really what

00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:56.419
we're dealing with here this morning. You'll remember that as Jesus begins to wash the feet

00:44:56.419 --> 00:45:01.379
of the disciples, eventually He comes to Peter. When He comes to Peter, what does Peter say?

00:45:02.979 --> 00:45:12.819
Not so, my Lord. No, no. No. Peter saith unto Him after this situation,

00:45:13.699 --> 00:45:20.099
Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus said, what I do thou knowest not in verse number 7 now,

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:25.139
but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter said, thou shalt never wash my feet.

00:45:26.979 --> 00:45:32.339
Jesus said, if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter then says, I mean,

00:45:32.339 --> 00:45:38.339
he totally changed his tone, right? All right, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

00:45:39.139 --> 00:45:47.139
Notice what Jesus says in verse number 10. He that is washed needeth not save to wash His feet,

00:45:47.779 --> 00:45:54.499
but is clean every wit, and ye are clean, but not all. In verse number 10, in closing this morning,

00:45:55.539 --> 00:45:59.939
if you think about the customs of the day, the culture in which the Lord Jesus Christ was living,

00:45:59.939 --> 00:46:06.899
and as the Scriptures are written, often you find about the washing of the feet.

00:46:08.579 --> 00:46:12.019
You find that they'd enter into a home, and there'd be servants that would wash feet.

00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:16.739
And you understand that they wore sandals, and they walked the same roads that their

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:20.419
livestock walked, and so on and so forth, and so feet became very dirty.

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:30.019
And in that particular era, they did not have the luxuries that we have today of inside plumbing,

00:46:30.019 --> 00:46:34.419
and bathrooms, and showers, and so on and so forth, and they would have bath houses.

00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:38.419
And what would happen is you'd go down to the bath house, and you'd get washed.

00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:44.499
But then you'd put on your robe, you'd put on your sandals, and you'd walk home,

00:46:44.499 --> 00:46:51.219
and guess what would get dirty? Your feet. So, when Jesus says in verse number 10,

00:46:51.219 --> 00:46:58.019
he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, they understand this truth of what

00:46:58.019 --> 00:47:02.819
they experienced when they would go, and they'd get washed. They'd go to the bath house,

00:47:03.699 --> 00:47:07.299
but then they would come, and they'd have dirty feet, and before they'd enter into their home,

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:10.979
they'd have to wash their feet again. They didn't have to get bathed again,

00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:19.059
just had to wash their feet. The spiritual truth of John 13 would be clear to us that He that is

00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:25.779
saved, the sin, the condition has already been dealt with, what we are.

00:47:26.259 --> 00:47:35.139
But our feet get dirty. We live in this sin-cursed world, and we need to have that continued cleansing

00:47:35.699 --> 00:47:40.899
from our sins. Does that make sense? Study John 13 more this afternoon, this evening. I don't

00:47:40.899 --> 00:47:46.339
have time to develop all of it, but the reality is that as we walk with Christ, what joy it is,

00:47:46.339 --> 00:47:51.539
the blessedness of fellowship. Listen, the fellowship's only possible because of relationship.

00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:58.899
What enables it? There has to be that sin offering that was dealt with on Wednesday evening.

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:07.859
And I'm thankful that Jesus Christ made one sacrifice for sin forever. Amen? What joy,

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:15.619
Hebrews 10 tells us. And after we're saved, we now have this opportunity for fellowship.

00:48:16.259 --> 00:48:18.739
But there are times in our lives we've experienced that there's been

00:48:19.299 --> 00:48:26.179
hindrances to our fellowship. My fellowship's been hindered. Sins hinder my fellowship.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:35.379
And if I understand that God, He gives us the recipe, if you will, to how to have restored

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:41.779
fellowship, and that really is the focus of the message this morning, the restoration of fellowship,

00:48:41.779 --> 00:48:47.779
how we can have that sweet communion with the Lord, the way back to God, if you will,

00:48:47.779 --> 00:48:51.939
if we could use that terminology. And I'm so thankful that He is faithful and just.

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:57.779
And if we have that honest evaluation, if we acknowledge our sins, if we confess them to the

00:48:57.779 --> 00:49:02.179
Lord, understanding that He's faithful and just and that He's going to forgive us and cleanse us,

00:49:02.179 --> 00:49:08.739
we have that restored fellowship. Listen, don't let sins hinder your fellowship with God.

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:18.500
Deal with them. Confess them. Listen, God already knows about them, right? Did God know that Adam

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.779
and Eve were naked in the garden? Did He know where they were in the garden? So when He said,

00:49:23.779 --> 00:49:28.739
where are you, did He really was looking for information? No, He knew exactly where they were.

00:49:28.739 --> 00:49:35.699
This morning, God knows if we have sins in our lives.

00:49:37.539 --> 00:49:41.059
And if you have sins in your life this morning that have hindered your fellowship,

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:47.699
it doesn't make you unique, for we all have sins that hinder our fellowship.

00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:53.379
Maybe this morning you just need to deal with some of them. Maybe this morning you ask God,

00:49:53.379 --> 00:49:58.179
help me to stay in the Word because I understand the absence of the Word is the direct link

00:49:58.179 --> 00:50:01.139
to hindered fellowship. Help me to stay in the Word. Stay clean.

00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:04.219
close to you so that fellowship doesn't get hindered.

00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:06.779
Help me to be able to identify in my life

00:50:06.779 --> 00:50:09.739
as soon as that fellowship is hindered

00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:12.459
because I don't wanna grow cold.

00:50:12.459 --> 00:50:15.459
I don't wanna drift apart and not even know

00:50:15.459 --> 00:50:17.679
that my fellowship's been hindered

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:20.419
until there's this great chasm between

00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:22.859
what my fellowship used to be and what it is now.

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:25.579
You ever hear a couple been married for a long time

00:50:25.579 --> 00:50:27.539
and they say, well, you know, we just drifted apart.

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:29.239
You ever hear somebody say that?

00:50:29.239 --> 00:50:30.779
They're getting divorced when they're like 60

00:50:30.779 --> 00:50:32.919
and you're saying, what's going on with that?

00:50:32.919 --> 00:50:34.679
I don't mean to be inappropriate by saying that.

00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:36.159
It's just puzzling to me.

00:50:37.099 --> 00:50:39.319
And so often you'll hear people that say,

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:42.179
we just drifted apart over the years.

00:50:42.179 --> 00:50:43.999
I don't wanna drift from God.

00:50:45.439 --> 00:50:46.639
Amen?

00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:48.879
By the way, God's not drifting from us.

00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:53.239
If there's any drifting, it's me drifting from God.

00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:56.119
And oh, that we could rejoice in knowing

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.799
that there's a way back to God, that restored fellowship.

00:50:59.799 --> 00:51:00.639
Let's pray.

00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:01.799
Father, we love you.

00:51:01.799 --> 00:51:03.459
How we love you.

00:51:03.459 --> 00:51:04.799
You're so good to us.

00:51:05.859 --> 00:51:07.019
You saved us.

00:51:08.019 --> 00:51:10.179
You desire to have fellowship with us.

00:51:11.219 --> 00:51:14.179
When we hinder that fellowship,

00:51:14.179 --> 00:51:18.259
you provide a way back to have restored fellowship.

00:51:18.259 --> 00:51:19.299
It's wonderful.

00:51:20.479 --> 00:51:22.899
God, if there's one here this morning that's not saved,

00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:24.419
they've never been born again.

00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:27.219
They could not say with certainty today

00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:29.299
that heaven is their home.

00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:30.959
They cannot have fellowship with you

00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:33.879
because they do not have relationship with you.

00:51:33.879 --> 00:51:36.119
Oh God, I pray that you'd work in their heart and life

00:51:36.119 --> 00:51:38.479
that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:51:39.799 --> 00:51:41.359
For every child of God,

00:51:42.479 --> 00:51:44.839
would you help us to have an honest evaluation?

00:51:46.119 --> 00:51:47.919
Would you help us to evaluate our lives

00:51:47.919 --> 00:51:50.719
to determine if our fellowship has been hindered?

00:51:50.719 --> 00:51:52.439
Perhaps there's one that would say,

00:51:52.439 --> 00:51:54.819
I know my fellowship is hindered.

00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:58.239
Oh God, would you help them to just be able to get it right,

00:51:58.239 --> 00:52:00.619
to have that restoration?

00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:03.779
They've longed for that sweet peace and that rest

00:52:03.779 --> 00:52:05.839
and they've just struggled.

00:52:07.819 --> 00:52:11.059
Satan got that toehold that became a stronghold.

00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:16.179
God, I pray that you'd help each one of us to evaluate

00:52:16.179 --> 00:52:18.579
and to acknowledge and to confess

00:52:18.579 --> 00:52:21.259
we might have forgiveness and cleansing.

00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:24.339
We thank you so much that you're faithful and just.

00:52:24.339 --> 00:52:26.579
We thank you so much that you promised us

00:52:27.439 --> 00:52:29.679
that you would forgive us and cleanse us

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:32.819
and how that causes us to rejoice greatly.

00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:36.559
John understood what it was to have fellowship with you.

00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:41.439
God, we desire this morning to have that sweet fellowship,

00:52:41.439 --> 00:52:44.199
that sweet communion to walk in the light

00:52:45.059 --> 00:52:47.679
as ye are in the light.

00:52:47.679 --> 00:52:49.319
Work and move as only you can

00:52:49.319 --> 00:52:51.119
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:51.999
Would you stand with me?

00:52:51.999 --> 00:52:54.759
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

00:52:54.759 --> 00:52:56.119
It's our custom at the end of our service

00:52:56.959 --> 00:52:59.459
to have an invitation to invite you to respond.

00:52:59.459 --> 00:53:00.299
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:53:00.299 --> 00:53:02.219
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

00:53:02.219 --> 00:53:04.819
how you could know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:06.339
If the Holy Spirit of God spoke to your heart

00:53:06.339 --> 00:53:08.559
in a very specific way this morning,

00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:12.059
maybe you need to come to this old fashioned altar and pray.

00:53:13.419 --> 00:53:15.379
Ask the Lord to help you in whatever area it is

00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:17.259
that he may have spoken to you.

00:53:17.259 --> 00:53:19.379
As Kimberly plays, The Altar is Open.

00:53:20.819 --> 00:53:25.819
â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª
