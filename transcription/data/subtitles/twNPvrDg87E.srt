1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
Jesus saves and a world needs to hear that truth.

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,099
Amen.

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,780
And he has called us and given us the great privilege

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,020
and responsibility of being his representative.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,979
Second Chronicles chapter 28,

6
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:13,939
Second Chronicles chapter number 28 this morning.

7
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:17,139
And we of course just finished our missions conference

8
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:19,420
and what a wonderful conference it was.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,040
And as I was experiencing the conference,

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,260
hearing the preaching from God's word

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,659
and being challenged in my own life

12
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:31,579
and being encouraged by the missionaries that were here,

13
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,939
being encouraged by many that I had conversation with

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,479
from within our congregation and discussions

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,380
and testimonies about how God was moving and working

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,099
and what a blessing.

17
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,299
I was encouraged and the Lord just kept bringing me back

18
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,700
to this portion of scripture

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,040
in Second Chronicles chapter number 28.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,900
And I look at this passage of scripture this morning

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,060
and I am thankful.

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,939
I'll say right at the beginning of the message this morning,

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,540
I'm thankful that God uses people

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,180
and that God uses individuals.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,019
Sometimes we might think,

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,940
well, there's really nothing I can do.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,699
I'm just little old me and I just can't make a difference.

28
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:16,699
No, as a child of God, you have Christ in you,

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,940
the hope of glory and God will use you for his honor

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,019
and for his glory to make a difference

31
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,540
in the place where he has you.

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,300
If it were just you, if it were just me,

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,699
that'd be a different story.

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,459
But after salvation, the Holy Spirit of God

35
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,220
and dwells in Christ in us,

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,220
man, it's a whole different situation.

37
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,980
And I am thankful that God uses individuals.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,540
The fact of the matter is that you could read

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,059
through the scriptures and you could look

40
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:51,580
at a whole host of examples in God's word

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,019
where God used individuals.

42
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,660
We could not only look to biblical history

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,379
and the canon of scripture,

44
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,580
but we could look at modern history.

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,779
We could look at the volumes of history

46
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,019
that have been written about church history

47
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,180
and Christian history.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,419
And you can read of God using individuals,

49
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,139
some people that just desired that God would use them.

50
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,220
They recognize that they were a channel

51
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,820
and that God could use them to bring honor and glory

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
to the Lord alone.

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,660
And what a blessing to consider this morning

54
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,660
that he wants to use us, that he would use us.

55
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,020
And this morning, as we look at this portion of scripture

56
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,740
in 2 Chronicles chapter number 28,

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,179
the portion of scripture that we're going to examine

58
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:44,259
provides with us a glimpse into the life of a prophet

59
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,339
by the name of Oded.

60
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:50,179
I will have mentioned to you that this is a prophet

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,899
of the Lord, excuse me,

62
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:55,699
that we really know very little about.

63
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,059
His name means restorer.

64
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,899
That's what his name means, restorer.

65
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:02,740
And I think about this text of scripture,

66
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,300
and it's interesting to me how this man, Oded,

67
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,899
comes on the scene of scripture

68
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,619
during the reign of Ahaz in Judah.

69
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:13,820
We, of course, can look at a number of folks.

70
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,580
One of the names of scripture that's very familiar to us

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,020
is a prophet by the name of Elijah.

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,660
And it's very interesting

73
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,699
if you were to read 1 Kings chapter 17,

74
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,259
how Elijah just, he's on the scene.

75
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,039
And here's this man, Elijah, a prophet of the Lord

76
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,580
that stands before the king of Israel

77
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,820
and delivers a message of judgment.

78
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,100
And I mean, he just appears on the pages of scripture

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,419
in 1 Kings 17 and verse number one.

80
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,460
Well, here, when we think about this man, Oded,

81
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,779
there is another man by the name of Oded in the scriptures.

82
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:45,320
It's a different man than what we're reading here.

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,300
But we read this man, Oded,

84
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,380
and the Bible tells us about this man

85
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,899
that is a prophet of the Lord.

86
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,179
And he comes on the pages of scripture

87
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,259
during the reign of Ahaz in Judah.

88
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,820
Now, understand with me

89
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,199
that this is well after the divided kingdom.

90
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,460
Just to give you the setting, if I can, just for a moment,

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,300
we'll look at the first eight verses by way of introduction

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,580
and really just see what's going on

93
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,860
historically at this particular time.

94
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,720
But understand that after the kingdom divided,

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,619
of course, the nation of Israel, 12 tribes,

96
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:18,380
the first king, Saul, followed by David,

97
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,839
followed by Solomon.

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,739
And then after the reign of Solomon,

99
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,540
by the way, those reigns were about 120 years,

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,779
about 100 years or so.

101
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:29,179
And we find that then comes after the reign of Solomon,

102
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,899
you have the divided kingdom.

103
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,559
From that point forward,

104
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,339
you'll read throughout the scriptures,

105
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,619
you'll read of Israel and you'll read of Judah.

106
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,980
Israel is the tribes, the nation of the North,

107
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,220
the 10 tribes, the Northern kingdom.

108
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,059
And Judah is the Southern kingdom, two tribes of the South.

109
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:51,799
I would say of the nation of Israel, the Northern kingdom,

110
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:54,940
that after the division, after the reign of Solomon,

111
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,660
that it was a slippery slope downward the whole way.

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,100
There were really no good kings in Israel.

113
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,299
They all were wicked and evil and did terrible things.

114
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:09,059
On the contrast, when you look at the nation of Judah,

115
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,980
you will find in Judah's history

116
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,579
that there were periods of time when they had good kings.

117
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,140
They had kings that feared the Lord,

118
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
that walked in the ways of the Lord,

119
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,059
that sought to do what God had commanded them to do.

120
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,059
And when you read about those good kings,

121
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:26,119
you'll see periods of time in Judah's history

122
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,660
where they experienced revival.

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,420
And amazing things happen.

124
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,220
When we begin to think about some of the good kings,

125
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,899
you begin to think about Jehoshaphat,

126
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,700
you think of Hezekiah, you think of Josiah.

127
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,420
Ahaz is not one of them.

128
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,739
He's not a good king.

129
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,859
He's a wicked man, he's a wicked king,

130
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,100
and he's king of Judah.

131
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,220
See, just as they had some good kings,

132
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,100
they had quite a few bad kings,

133
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,540
just like Israel, the northern kingdom, had.

134
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,459
And we find that at this particular time

135
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:56,459
in Israel's history that Judah has Ahaz

136
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,980
reigning as their king,

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,739
but up in Israel, the northern kingdom,

138
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,899
a fellow by the name of Pekah is reigning as king.

139
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,640
He also is a wicked man.

140
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,459
We see that Pekah is the king that's reigning

141
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,820
at the northern kingdom.

142
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,320
Ahaz is reigning in Judah, the southern kingdom.

143
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,380
But there are two other people groups

144
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,399
that are important for us to understand

145
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,779
in the background of this particular text of scripture,

146
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,140
and that is a man by the name of Rezin.

147
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,299
And Rezin is the king of Syria.

148
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,339
And then you also have Tiglath-Pilneser,

149
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,540
who is the king of Assyria.

150
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,820
And so you have the Syrians and you have the Assyrians.

151
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,880
Eventually, the Assyrians obviously take and capture

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,799
Assyria, and then eventually they take the northern kingdom.

153
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,279
In fact, during the reign of Pekah,

154
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,359
during the same period of time,

155
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:49,320
is when the Assyrian captivity began.

156
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,839
It's not in its full stage,

157
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,239
but it's when the Assyrian captivity began

158
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,559
of the northern kingdom.

159
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,600
We'll understand from our Bible history

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,160
and studying through the scriptures

161
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,239
that Israel was taken captive, the northern kingdom,

162
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,380
by Assyria, whereas the southern kingdom, Judah,

163
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,019
was taken captive by the Babylonians.

164
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:11,179
And as we look at this portion of scripture,

165
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,579
it's important for us to understand

166
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,059
some of those players in history, if you will.

167
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,220
Israel's king, Judah's king,

168
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,899
Syria and Assyria's rulers or kings.

169
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,339
And we find that as we come to this portion of scripture,

170
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,899
again, the setting is provided to us

171
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,299
in verses one through eight,

172
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,660
and Ahas is a wicked king.

173
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,480
Notice what the Bible tells us about this man,

174
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,179
and understand with me this morning

175
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,200
that God makes it very clear

176
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,600
that he would bring judgment because of the wickedness.

177
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,239
We understand this morning, the Bible says,

178
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,260
that God is a righteous God and he loves righteousness.

179
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,720
We understand that the Bible says,

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,320
righteousness exalteth a nation,

181
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,600
but sin is a reproach to any people.

182
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,140
And we find that the sin of Ahas and the people of Judah

183
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,720
would bring the distinct hand of judgment upon them.

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,200
In verse number one, the Bible says,

185
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,160
Ahas was 20 years old when he began to reign,

186
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,019
and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem,

187
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,519
but he did not that which was right

188
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,640
in the sight of the Lord, like David his father.

189
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,320
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel

190
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,920
and made also, notice the first indictment against him

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,920
in verse number two, he made molten images for Balaam.

192
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,899
We understand that their sin with Israel and Judah

193
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,459
very consistently throughout the scriptures,

194
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,779
a sin of idolatry.

195
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,219
And we understand that God said

196
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,380
during the giving of the 10 commandments,

197
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,859
thou shalt have no other God before me.

198
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,500
Thou shalt make no graven images.

199
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,099
And we find that the Bible tells us

200
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,020
that this man Ahas in his reign of Judah,

201
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,299
that he made also molten images for Balaam.

202
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,760
Notice the word in verse number three,

203
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,700
it says, moreover, in addition to this,

204
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,340
and it begins to list the indictment against Ahas

205
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,659
in the nation of Judah,

206
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,780
I have written in the margin of my Bible,

207
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,039
the slippery slope of sin.

208
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,820
Listen, sin is dangerous.

209
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,059
Hebrew says it this way with regard to sin,

210
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,000
the deceitfulness of sin.

211
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,659
And we find that as we look at these first eight verses

212
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,299
here and really the first six verses

213
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,619
that gives us the indictment against Ahas

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
in the nation of Judah,

215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
you see the slippery slope of sin,

216
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,500
and it's so dangerous.

217
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Listen, sin is not something to mess with.

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,799
Sin is not something to play with.

219
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,640
We need to make sure that in our lives

220
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,039
that we're seeking to walk godly, holy lives,

221
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,619
pleasing unto our Lord,

222
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,020
that we would be unspotted from the world.

223
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,140
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us that,

224
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,280
listen, there's not gonna be a place of sinless perfection

225
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,400
in our lives until we get to glory,

226
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,960
but we should be sinning less.

227
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,039
And the Bible says that when we sin,

228
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,739
that we have an advocate with the Father,

229
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,400
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

230
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,820
We find here that the Bible says,

231
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,539
moreover, in addition to making these molten images

232
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,380
for Balaam,

233
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,380
Notice it says that he burnt incense in the valley of the sun of Hinnom.

234
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,380
Notice this. This is mind-blowing to me.

235
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:17,380
And burnt his children in the fire.

236
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Wow.

237
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,380
It says, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel,

238
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,380
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.

239
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Notice the last statement of verse number 6. I'll come back to verse 5 in just a moment.

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
But the very last statement of verse number 6 says this,

241
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

242
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Wow. What an indictment.

243
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,380
And we find that this is the setting.

244
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,380
This is the backdrop for this man Oded that we're going to really study this morning

245
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
and look at his life and look at his courage.

246
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:06,380
And we find that Ahaz, this wicked king of Judah, is leading Judah into all of this wickedness,

247
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,380
this sin that is prevailing, and we find that the Bible tells us that judgment would come.

248
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Notice, if you will, in verse number 5, the Bible says,

249
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,380
The Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria.

250
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,380
That's Rezin. I mentioned some of these other people in the by way of introduction that I wanted us to be familiar with,

251
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
and that is Rezin.

252
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
And the Bible says,

253
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
And they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives.

254
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,380
God does not tell us the exact number that are taken captive by the Syrians,

255
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,380
but we see here in the text of Scripture that that's where the judgment of the Lord begins.

256
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
And then notice it says,

257
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:47,380
And brought them to Damascus, and he also was delivered into the hand of the king of Israel,

258
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,380
who smote him with a great slaughter.

259
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
Now that's Pekah, king of Israel.

260
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
And the Bible says in verse number 6,

261
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,380
For Pekah the son of Amalia slew in Judah,

262
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
notice what this says,

263
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,380
and 120,000 in one day, which were all valiant men.

264
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Why? Because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

265
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,380
So Rezin, king of Syria, has taken a host of people captive back to Syria, to Damascus.

266
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
We find that then Pekah comes in,

267
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,380
and Pekah in one day, 120,000 valiant men are killed.

268
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,380
In verse number 7, it begins to highlight to us some of the key people, if you will, that were slain.

269
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
It says,

270
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,380
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maseah, the king's son,

271
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,380
and Azraqam, the governor of the house, and Elkanah, that was next to the king.

272
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Notice in addition to killing these 120,000 people in one day,

273
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,380
now this is Pekah, king of Israel, against Judah, king of Ahaz.

274
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Excuse me, Ahaz, king of Judah.

275
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,380
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 8,

276
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:05,380
And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren 200,000,

277
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,380
women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them,

278
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,380
and brought the spoil to Samaria.

279
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,380
Samaria is the capital city of the northern kingdom.

280
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Israel is referred to it as.

281
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,380
And we find that according to verse number 6,

282
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,380
120,000 valiant men were slain by Pekah, the king of Israel.

283
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,380
And then in verse number 8, they take 200,000 captive.

284
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,380
That's a large number of people.

285
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,380
The journey that they would take to bring them back to Samaria,

286
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,380
the king of the northern kingdom, Israel,

287
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
we find they would take this journey.

288
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,380
And I want you to understand, as we think about the time,

289
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
and the culture, and all of those things,

290
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,380
that oftentimes when a people group would conquer another group,

291
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,380
and they would come back to their hometown, to their capital,

292
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,380
as would be the case with this situation,

293
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,380
there's a big fanfare that's taking place.

294
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
There's great excitement that's taking place.

295
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Why? You've brought these captives back, but you've also brought the spoils.

296
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,380
And there's a certain setting that we must understand

297
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,380
as we look at these first eight verses of 2 Chronicles 28,

298
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,380
and you see the great wickedness that's taking place.

299
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,380
You see these valiant men that have not only slain,

300
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
but now taken captive this large host,

301
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
and they bring all of this spoil,

302
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
and they're entering into Samaria.

303
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,380
No doubt in my mind there's a measure of fanfare that's taking place.

304
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
There's some excitement because the military's returning,

305
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
and they're returning triumphantly,

306
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,380
and they're returning not only with captives, but with spoil.

307
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
And notice verse number 9.

308
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,380
But a prophet of the Lord was there.

309
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,380
But a prophet of the Lord was there whose name was Oded.

310
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,380
He just comes on the pages of Scripture.

311
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,380
He's a prophet of the Lord, man of God.

312
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
I've titled the message you've seen in the bulletin,

313
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,380
The Courage of Oded.

314
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Begin to think about the background that we've read in these eight verses,

315
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,380
and we come to verse number 9, and we see this man

316
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,380
that appears on the pages of Scripture seemingly out of nowhere.

317
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,380
And we see the wickedness,

318
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,380
and we see the power of the nation of Israel,

319
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,380
and we see what's taking place, and then there's this man Oded.

320
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,380
If you're taking notes this morning, I just have two thoughts for you.

321
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
The first one is this.

322
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,380
I want you to notice the opportunity.

323
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
The opportunity.

324
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,380
You'd say, Pastor, you're going to call it an opportunity that Oded had?

325
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Oh yeah, it was an opportunity.

326
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,380
It was an opportunity that many of us perhaps

327
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,380
would not really look at as being an opportunity.

328
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Because you begin to think of all that's taking place

329
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,380
and all of this great thing, but you find that Oded is there,

330
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,380
and he's just an individual, but he's a prophet of the Lord.

331
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,380
And the Bible tells us, notice in verse number 9,

332
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,380
but a prophet of the Lord was there whose name was Oded,

333
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,380
and he, Oded, he went out before the host

334
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,380
that came to Samaria and said unto them.

335
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Now, I can't even hardly imagine in my mind's eye,

336
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,380
my sanctified imagination, trying to see this scene.

337
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,380
200,000 captive.

338
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
120,000 that were slain.

339
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,380
So this is a large contingency of the army of the nation of Israel

340
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
that's returning from this battle.

341
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,380
They're returning, they have 200,000 captives with them,

342
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,380
all of the spoil, and then here comes Oded,

343
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,380
and he comes and he stands right in front of them.

344
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Wow.

345
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
Wow.

346
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,380
And he takes and he says, and I believe with boldness,

347
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,380
he said unto them, Behold, because the Lord your God,

348
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,380
the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Judah,

349
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,380
he hath delivered them into your hand,

350
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,380
and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

351
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:17,380
See, God was judging Judah because of their wickedness.

352
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,380
But Oded is going to deliver a message to Israel

353
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,380
about their own sin.

354
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,380
And about God's hand of judgment that would come upon them.

355
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Notice as we continue and looking here in verse number 10,

356
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,380
the Bible says, And now ye purpose to keep unto the children of Judah

357
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,380
and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you,

358
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:48,380
but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your God?

359
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Listen, Israel, don't think that you're righteous

360
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,380
because God delivered Judah into your hand.

361
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
You have sins.

362
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,380
And he says that you intend, notice in verse number 10,

363
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,380
he says that you purpose to keep unto the children of Judah and Jerusalem

364
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
for bondmen and bondwomen unto you.

365
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,380
By the way, that was a violation of the law.

366
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,380
It was a violation of the law, a clear violation of the law.

367
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
We don't have time to go back to Leviticus 25,

368
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,380
but if you go back there you can read through that chapter

369
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,380
and you can see a number of times in Leviticus 25

370
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,380
where God specifically says that they should not make bondmen of their brethren.

371
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,380
That's exactly what they're going to do.

372
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,380
And notice Oded, he then says, he says this in verse number 11,

373
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Now hear me therefore, can you see this?

374
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again,

375
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
which ye have taken captive of your brethren,

376
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,380
for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.

377
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
What does he tell him?

378
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Well, I would say this, he went before the host,

379
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,380
he stands there according to verses 9 through 11,

380
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
I said I want you to note the opportunity.

381
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,380
I would say it this way, he sees the opportunity.

382
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
Not only did he see it, but he seized it.

383
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,380
And he takes advantage of the opportunity that God gives.

384
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,380
I cannot even begin to understand how much boldness and courage

385
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
this must have required on the part of Oded

386
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,380
to go stand before this great host of people and to deliver this message.

387
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,380
But I want you to understand this morning that he spoke to them the word of God.

388
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,380
He spoke to them the message that God had previously delivered

389
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
and he's faithful to give that message.

390
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,380
I would say this, that he was obedient to the Lord.

391
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,380
And in his obedience he operated with faith,

392
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,380
with courage, and with boldness.

393
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,380
And he stood before this great host that had just experienced a great victory

394
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,380
and the wickedness that had permeated the land.

395
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I mean not only do you have Israel with all of their wickedness and sin,

396
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,380
but you also have Judah with all their wickedness and sin as we just read.

397
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
And then this man of God is going to come.

398
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,140
and deliver this message.

399
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,860
I want you to notice very clearly

400
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,740
that he stands there and not only

401
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,900
does he tell them what they've done wrong,

402
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,580
but he tells them how to correct it.

403
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,220
In verse number 11, he says,

404
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,780
now hear me therefore,

405
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,420
and deliver the captives again

406
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,260
what you have taken of your brethren.

407
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,900
Return them.

408
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,620
Return them.

409
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,260
This is the course of action

410
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,780
that Oded delivers to these valiant men,

411
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,460
to these that have been successful in battle.

412
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,860
And he says this to them at the end of verse number 11,

413
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,260
for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.

414
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,340
For the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.

415
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,740
I want you to notice with me,

416
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,100
as we begin to think about this man, Oded,

417
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,980
and how he just comes on the pages of scripture

418
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,340
and delivers such a clear message.

419
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,580
A message that he stands up and delivers

420
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,540
with faith and courage and boldness.

421
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,780
I believe this morning that we need some individuals

422
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,460
that will stand up for the Lord.

423
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,340
That we will operate by faith,

424
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,060
trusting that God is able to use his people

425
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,340
as they deliver the message of his word.

426
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,340
I would say this, that we need to operate with courage.

427
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,620
I think about Joshua,

428
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,780
and you read the first chapter of the book of Joshua

429
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,420
and how God tells Joshua repeatedly to be courageous.

430
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,980
You think about having courage,

431
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,780
and I would say to you this morning

432
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,260
that courage does not mean the absence of fear.

433
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,680
There's some people that have the idea

434
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,260
that courage means that you have no fear.

435
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,340
It's really not, that's not entirely what courage means.

436
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,820
Courage means that we do what's right no matter what.

437
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,440
There might be some fear,

438
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,680
but you have courage to say I'm gonna do what's right.

439
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,560
I don't know, and I don't want to overstate it this morning,

440
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,920
but when I look at this portion of scripture

441
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,720
and I see Oded standing before this great host,

442
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,240
I think, man, I don't, could I do that?

443
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,400
Could you do that?

444
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,800
I mean, this mighty group of people that are wicked,

445
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,840
that are ungodly, that have just had great victory,

446
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,440
that are bringing all this great number of people captive

447
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,360
in all the spoils, and Oded gets out there,

448
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,120
and listen, there's no stammering and stuttering.

449
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,559
There's no beating around the bush.

450
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,080
He's just straight as an arrow.

451
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
Here's the message from God.

452
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,279
And he says in verse number 11, now hear me therefore.

453
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,080
I mean, I can just see this man standing there

454
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,419
with courage and boldness.

455
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,160
God uses this message in this man

456
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,260
to accomplish something amazing.

457
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,720
And that's what we look at in this passage of scripture.

458
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,760
We see the opportunity, but number two,

459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
I want you to notice not only the opportunity,

460
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,160
but I want you to notice the outcome.

461
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,139
Notice the outcome.

462
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:08,200
Now, the reality is that we have the privilege

463
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
of looking at this portion of scripture

464
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,559
of an event that took place thousands of years ago,

465
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,639
and we have the opportunity to be able to read the outcome.

466
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,740
But for you and for me, every day

467
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,220
when God gives us opportunities to stand in his stead,

468
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,000
to stand by faith and to speak with courage and boldness,

469
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,820
we don't always know what the outcome's going to be.

470
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,620
I would submit to you this morning

471
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,700
that Oded did not know what the outcome was going to be.

472
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
He just did what was right.

473
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,820
As a prophet of the Lord, he said,

474
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,300
I'm gonna seize this opportunity.

475
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,880
And as we look at the outcome of this text of scripture,

476
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,240
it's recorded to us in verses 12 through 15.

477
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,360
In verses 12 and 13 reveals to us,

478
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,320
it records for us the response of the leaders.

479
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,860
Notice the Bible says this in verse number 12.

480
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,320
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim,

481
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,960
and so these are the leaders,

482
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,880
these heads of the children of Ephraim,

483
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
Azariah, the son of Johanan,

484
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
Barakiah, the son of Meshelamoth,

485
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,279
and Jehezekiah, the son of Shalom,

486
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,480
and Amasah, the son of Hadlai,

487
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,480
stood up against them that came from the war.

488
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,279
They don't stand up against Oded.

489
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,959
They stand up against those that came.

490
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,600
And notice in verse number 13,

491
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,320
notice what they say to them.

492
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Ye shall not bring in the captives hither.

493
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,360
What gave them that idea, Oded?

494
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,480
That was exactly the message that he delivered to them.

495
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
And he says, for whereas,

496
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,880
notice in the remainder of verse number 13,

497
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,839
we have offended against the Lord already.

498
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,839
Ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass,

499
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:59,800
for our trespass is great,

500
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,320
and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

501
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,360
Wow.

502
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,200
The outcome immediately is positive.

503
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,760
Oded delivered this message in boldness and in courage,

504
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
and we find that the leaders,

505
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,360
they immediately respond by saying to these

506
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,920
that were coming, no, no, no,

507
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,480
you can't bring them in here.

508
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,440
We've already offended against the Lord.

509
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
Now we're going to add more to our sins

510
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,000
and to our trespasses.

511
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,080
And it says this, for there is fierce wrath against Israel.

512
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:42,679
Again, we find that that's exactly in line with the message

513
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,040
that Oded had delivered to these people.

514
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,440
They heard the man of God stand up

515
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,820
and speak the word of God.

516
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,880
You know, I wonder this morning,

517
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,880
it seems as if there's a lack of a fear of God in our nation.

518
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,679
You think that this morning?

519
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
No.

520
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,640
There's a lack of people fearing the Lord.

521
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,040
But I would say this,

522
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,520
it's not only a lack of lost people fearing the Lord,

523
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,720
it's a lack of God's people fearing the Lord.

524
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,860
There are things that believers do.

525
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,279
Talk about this passage of scripture dealing with sin,

526
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,920
outlining the sin of Ahaz here in the nation of Judah.

527
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,480
They begin to think about the sin,

528
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,839
the things that people,

529
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,640
God's people have just gotten comfortable with.

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,839
There's no fear of God.

531
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,000
There's no fear of God.

532
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,440
And maybe, just maybe if we'd have a fear of God

533
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,160
and we'd stand up in boldness and proclaim

534
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,880
the truth of God's judgment,

535
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
that maybe some other people would begin

536
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,040
to get the fear of God as well.

537
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,399
How many times we see,

538
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:54,880
listen, God's in control of everything, you believe that?

539
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Listen, I believe that America in my lifetime,

540
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I believe that America has faced the divine judgment of God.

541
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,500
There have been what we often refer to as natural disasters.

542
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,800
I believe that's God's hand of judgment

543
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,880
upon a people that have forsaken the Lord,

544
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,839
upon a people that have turned their back on God.

545
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,839
They try to explain it away, global warming.

546
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,959
It's an easy way to get the attention off

547
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,279
of something spiritual.

548
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm not gonna preach a message this morning

549
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
on global warming,

550
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,559
but I want you to understand that it's nonsense.

551
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,000
And I want you to understand this morning

552
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,559
that the Bible teaches us if you just go back to Genesis

553
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,000
and read the Noahic Covenant,

554
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
it really destroys everything with regard to global warming.

555
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,239
And you understand this morning

556
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,040
that our God is in control of all things.

557
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,720
And the reality is that his hand of judgment

558
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,360
has been upon this people, this land, why?

559
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,520
Because of our sin.

560
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,559
But we find that the New Testament tells us

561
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,820
that judgment must begin where?

562
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,619
At the house of God, the house of God.

563
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:15,660
Listen, we need to have a healthy fear of God.

564
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,619
And we find here that these wicked people in Israel,

565
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,660
they hear the message of a prophet of God that stands up

566
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,619
and they say, hey, listen,

567
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,459
we need to change course of action here.

568
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,660
You're not bringing those people in here.

569
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,700
No, no, we don't want, we've already sinned

570
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,540
against the Lord.

571
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,900
We've already offended against him.

572
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,380
We don't need to add more sin.

573
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,660
And there's fierce wrath against Israel.

574
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,020
So we see the outcome initially in verses 12 and 13

575
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,179
with the response of the leaders.

576
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,299
But I want you to see the response of the armed men

577
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,500
according to verse number 14.

578
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,580
The Bible says here,

579
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,660
so the armed men left the captives in the spoil.

580
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,940
Now they're going to benefit from the spoil, are they not?

581
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,140
You think about the victor as they come in

582
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,020
and as they begin to enjoy the victory

583
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,460
and all of the fanfare and all that takes place

584
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,500
and they are held in some kind of prestigious position

585
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
because of what they were able to accomplish

586
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,220
and not only the captives that they brought back,

587
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,299
but also all of that great spoil.

588
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,020
And the Bible says that these armed men,

589
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,059
they left the captives and the spoil

590
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,020
before the princes and all the congregation.

591
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Just leave it there.

592
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,020
Just leave it.

593
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:30,460
I believe as you look at verse number 14,

594
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,619
again, not to embellish the text of scripture

595
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,940
or what's taking place, this particular account,

596
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,539
but it says that in verse number 14

597
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:39,780
that they left it before the princes,

598
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
and all the congregation.

599
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,619
Oded didn't have a private meeting and Stanton,

600
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,900
no, no, he was just out there

601
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,500
with the whole group of people that came

602
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,099
and he just spoke the word of God

603
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,299
with courage and boldness.

604
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,580
God used him.

605
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,179
I want you to notice with me

606
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,299
the significance of verse number 15.

607
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,019
in our text of scripture.

608
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,299
It's in this verse of scripture

609
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,299
that we read of the release and the return of the captives.

610
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,219
In fact, the Bible tells us it's amazing

611
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,619
how this all takes place.

612
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:10,939
The Bible says in verse number 15,

613
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,619
the men which were expressed by name rose up

614
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:17,379
and took the captives and with the spoil

615
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:20,739
clothed all that were naked among them

616
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:22,739
and arrayed them and shot them

617
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,179
and gave them to eat and to drink

618
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:28,979
and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them

619
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:31,819
upon asses and brought them to Jericho,

620
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,659
the city of palm trees, to their brethren.

621
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,959
Then they returned to Samaria.

622
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:39,819
That's amazing to me, verse number 15.

623
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:44,459
They didn't just say at the gate of Samaria,

624
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,219
okay, we've changed our mind because of what this guy said.

625
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,339
We're not gonna bring you in here.

626
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:49,799
You guys can just go back.

627
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,379
It's not what they did.

628
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,339
The Bible tells us in verse number 15

629
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:57,119
that they took all those captives

630
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,679
and those that were naked among them,

631
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,799
they clothed them with that spoil that they had taken

632
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,419
and they arrayed them, they shot them,

633
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,339
they gave them to eat and to drink.

634
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,599
I mean, they're taking care of these people.

635
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,099
What a great contrast to how they were originally coming

636
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,539
to the gate of Samaria.

637
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,899
And then the Bible tells us,

638
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,079
notice it says that they anointed them

639
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,619
and carried all the feeble of them upon asses

640
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,619
and brought them to Jericho.

641
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,939
So these people then returned the captives back to Jericho.

642
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,659
They take the journey, the number of miles that it is,

643
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,379
the treacherous terrain and all of the Judean wilderness,

644
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:45,559
and they take these people back to Jericho.

645
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,859
The Bible identifies it being the city of palm trees.

646
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:49,119
And if you've ever been to Jericho,

647
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,499
you understand why it's called that.

648
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:53,559
You're in the middle of nowhere, the Judean wilderness,

649
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,739
you come over the horizon,

650
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,579
all of a sudden you see all these trees,

651
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,699
and it's amazing the sight that you'd see,

652
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:02,439
and it's referred to even here as the city of palm trees.

653
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:07,439
It says, to their brethren, then they returned to Samaria.

654
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,499
They returned to Samaria, who's they?

655
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:12,859
It's those people that are from Israel

656
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:15,419
that had come and slain and taken captive.

657
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,859
And now they return these and they go back.

658
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,259
I would submit to you this morning,

659
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,659
what a passage of scripture.

660
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,659
I would say to you this morning that 200,000 people,

661
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,459
that's a lot of people,

662
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:33,779
200,000 people were directly impacted

663
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:37,839
because of the obedience of one man, Oded.

664
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,379
One man, an individual.

665
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,139
An individual that said,

666
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:48,019
in the face of all that he was facing,

667
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,259
this great host of people and all of the wickedness,

668
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,019
he said, I'm gonna obey God.

669
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:55,579
I'm just gonna obey God.

670
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,419
And he stands up with boldness and with courage,

671
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,579
and he delivers a message,

672
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,539
and because of his obedience,

673
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,359
200,000 people are returned.

674
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,459
How many of those people may have had families

675
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,139
that were still back in Judah?

676
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:13,579
I have no idea.

677
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:17,299
I have no idea what those 200,000 people did

678
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,019
after they got back to Jericho.

679
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,419
But I would submit to you this morning

680
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,579
that those 200,000 people would have been thankful

681
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,299
that Oded stood up and delivered a message.

682
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,819
Don't you think?

683
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:32,939
Can you imagine if you were part of that captive group?

684
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,459
You knew what was taking place when you were traveling

685
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:37,939
from your hometown up to Samaria.

686
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:40,459
You understood what your future would look like

687
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,379
as being a captive.

688
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,379
You understood several things with regard to being

689
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,059
taken away from your home.

690
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,979
And then things change.

691
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:54,179
Perhaps you were close enough

692
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:58,259
within the sound of the voice of Oded.

693
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:00,099
You heard him say what he said.

694
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:03,199
Maybe you say, who's that speaking?

695
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:05,539
I don't know who that is.

696
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,939
But man, he's speaking with boldness.

697
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,819
He's a prophet of the Lord.

698
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,419
He's speaking the word of God.

699
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,019
And God is working through him.

700
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,959
And God worked through him in such a way

701
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:26,959
that those people, those heads of the children of Ephraim,

702
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,019
those armed men,

703
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:32,019
we're not gonna mess with Oded.

704
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,059
We're gonna do what he said.

705
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:36,139
We're gonna send these people back.

706
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,259
It's amazing to me.

707
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:41,759
The difference that one man made.

708
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,139
Sometimes in our lives we think,

709
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,959
well, can I really make a difference?

710
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,059
What could God really do with me?

711
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,479
I don't, and we start offering excuses kind of like Moses.

712
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:58,959
I'm thankful.

713
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:04,259
And I believe that these 200,000 are thankful that Oded

714
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:06,779
didn't make an excuse.

715
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:10,799
That Oded said, I'm just an individual,

716
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,359
but I serve a mighty God.

717
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,940
I'm just an individual, but God can use me.

718
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,619
I'm thankful this morning that God wants to work through us

719
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,359
to accomplish through our lives

720
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,659
more than we could ever accomplish on our own.

721
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,079
Far greater.

722
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,799
It's said of D.L. Moody that he desired to,

723
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,059
well, it's said of him that he shook two continents

724
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,440
with the gospel.

725
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,699
Speaking of North America and Europe.

726
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,440
It's said of D.L. Moody's ministry

727
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,639
that over a million people came to know Christ

728
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,839
because of his ministry.

729
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,179
If you know anything about D.L. Moody,

730
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:46,699
he was a man that according to what our society

731
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:49,819
and what our culture would say, he was an unlearned man.

732
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:52,419
He didn't have an advanced education,

733
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:55,279
but he got saved.

734
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,059
God, the Holy Spirit lived within him.

735
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,259
And he was just fully surrendered to God.

736
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:05,559
And he just said, God, I want you to use my life.

737
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,940
I want you to use me, God, for your honor and for your glory.

738
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,579
There were people that would come to D.L. Moody.

739
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,679
I mean, preachers that were contemporaries with him

740
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,319
and they would want to know the quote unquote secret

741
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,639
of his success.

742
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,879
I mean, people would hear that D.L. Moody was preaching

743
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,199
and they'd flock to hear him preach.

744
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,799
It wasn't necessarily because he was a great orator.

745
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,440
It's because he had the power of God.

746
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,739
It's because he had the power of God.

747
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:34,759
You think about the Lord Jesus Christ when he was teaching,

748
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,919
when he first comes on the scene in his earthly ministry

749
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,639
and they say, no man spoke like this man.

750
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,299
He speaks with authority.

751
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:47,319
See, D.L. Moody was a man that had the power of God upon him.

752
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:50,359
It's said in one particular account that I've read

753
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,639
over the years of D.L. Moody,

754
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,319
it said that he was there in his office

755
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,879
and somebody asked him that question,

756
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,879
the secret of his success,

757
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,959
and he went over to a window that overlooked the city

758
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,239
and he just looked down and he said,

759
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,559
see all those people, that's,

760
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,599
God's called me to reach those people.

761
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,919
He was on a heart for people.

762
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,959
Why, because he knew that people were

763
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,419
facing the judgment of God.

764
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,440
See, Oded knew that Israel was under the,

765
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,479
yes, Judah, because of their wickedness,

766
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,639
faced the judgment of God,

767
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,799
but Israel, you're gonna face the great wrath of God as well

768
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,519
because they're in a very real sense this morning

769
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,479
that we come in contact with people every single day

770
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,079
that are under the wrath of God.

771
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:30,679
They're under the wrath of God.

772
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,459
If you read John chapter number three,

773
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,940
the Bible makes it very clear.

774
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,199
In fact, let's go there and read it.

775
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,039
John chapter number three,

776
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,759
and we're gonna, I was planning to just finish up

777
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,239
on the book of Jude, but let's look at John three

778
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,379
just very quickly.

779
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,659
Of course, in John chapter number three,

780
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:48,500
we're very familiar with the verse number 16.

781
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,459
For God so loved the world that he gave

782
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:52,299
his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him

783
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:54,899
should not perish, but have everlasting life.

784
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,899
What a wonderful verse of scripture.

785
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:00,239
We find that Jesus came to seek and to save

786
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,279
that which was lost.

787
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,859
The Bible continues in verse number 17.

788
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,699
It says God sent not his son into the world

789
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,940
to condemn the world, but that the world through him

790
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,199
might be saved.

791
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,419
But look at verse 36 in John chapter number three.

792
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,440
We don't have time to read the entirety of it,

793
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,299
but look at verse number 36 of John chapter number three,

794
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,979
the last verse of this chapter.

795
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:18,819
The Bible says this.

796
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,619
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.

797
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,220
And he that believeth not the Son shall not see life,

798
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,539
but the wrath of God abideth on him.

799
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,940
The wrath of God abideth on him.

800
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,559
There's a sentence of eternal damnation.

801
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:46,700
It's upon every individual that's not trusted Christ

802
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,739
as their savior.

803
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,899
And you and I come in contact with those people

804
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:51,979
every single day.

805
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,979
And I understand there's a lot of them that

806
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,459
they don't think they need what we have.

807
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,760
They don't want to hear what you have to say.

808
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,719
But I believe that this morning,

809
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,940
we need to have the power of God in our lives.

810
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,500
Like Oded did.

811
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,559
We need to just determine that we're gonna say,

812
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,019
we're gonna be God's spokesman.

813
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,559
We're gonna do what he's called us to do.

814
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,239
Turn to the book of Jude, if you will.

815
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,140
And as we get alone with God,

816
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,019
and we have the touch of God upon our lives,

817
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,359
I'm not talking about some kind of mystical thing.

818
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,820
But I'm just saying we spend time in the presence of God.

819
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,979
I want you to think about those disciples

820
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,279
in Acts chapter number four,

821
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:38,519
when that religious group of people were trying to,

822
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:41,140
after they'd already kept them in ward overnight,

823
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,580
and they're going to bring these accusations against them.

824
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,260
And the Bible says that Peter stands up

825
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,940
and he speaks with great boldness.

826
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,019
And the Bible says that they took knowledge of them

827
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,700
that they had been with Jesus.

828
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,419
There was an obvious impact

829
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,700
that was made upon that religious group

830
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,059
because they said, these men, they're atheists.

831
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:07,219
ignorant and unlearned, but they've been with Jesus. People need to know that we've spent

832
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:16,499
time with God. Listen, you can't fake it. You can't fake it. Let me say this, you can't

833
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:27,299
expedite it. There's not any instant, you ever have instant mashed potatoes? How many

834
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:33,019
of you like instant mashed potatoes better than regular mashed potatoes? I mean, you're

835
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:36,819
crazy if you do. You haven't had Holly's mashed potatoes, amen? But I'm telling you what,

836
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:42,339
I like mashed potatoes, but I don't want those instant things. I really don't. You say, well,

837
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:51,999
they're creamier, they don't have lumps. I like the lumps. Amen? I know they're real.

838
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:59,159
We live in an instant society. I don't like instant coffee. Try to put those grounds in

839
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:05,279
there. It's disgusting. I just not drink coffee if I have to drink instant coffee. Honestly,

840
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:21,239
you cannot expedite time with God. You can't. You've got to get into His presence. Be still

841
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:31,919
and know that I am God. And when you get into His presence, people can tell that you've

842
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:42,319
been with God. Oded, who's used of the Lord to make a difference. An individual, 200,000

843
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,979
people, amazing to me. But I want you to see from Jude 22, so many people say, can God

844
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:54,579
use me to make a difference? The answer is yes. God can use you. I want you to notice

845
00:41:54,579 --> 00:42:03,379
what the Bible says. In Jude, it's only one chapter, verse 22, and if some have compassion,

846
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:09,459
making a difference. And others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating

847
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:20,339
even the garment spotted by the flesh. Oded had courage. We need courage today. We need

848
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:28,339
courage. We need boldness. We need to spend time with God. And God will use us to make

849
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:36,619
a difference in people's lives. I would encourage you, I've encouraged myself, to ask God to

850
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:45,899
use us for His honor and for His glory. That He would use us to make a difference. Not

851
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:55,059
for ourselves, but for His glory. As best we can tell from that portion of Scripture

852
00:42:55,059 --> 00:43:04,300
in 2 Chronicles 28, Oded did not benefit one thing by standing up and declaring the message

853
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:13,539
of God. But there are 200,000 people that were directly impacted because of his obedience.

854
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:18,179
I'm not telling you this morning that God will use you to impact 200,000 people, but

855
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:28,139
I'm saying He could. He could. Only eternity is going to tell how God will use us. Very

856
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,699
few people know the name of the man that led D.L. Moody to the Lord. Very few people know

857
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:41,099
the man that was preaching when Charles Haddon Spurgeon went into that church and got saved.

858
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:48,179
God's economy is different than our economy. God knows. He keeps good records. And I trust

859
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:54,500
that this morning, just as we look at Oded, this, probably this morning, and I'm not saying

860
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,500
this to be, as an insult, but probably this morning, many of us have no idea who Oded

861
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,099
was before he came to church today. So, yeah, maybe I heard about that guy. What did he

862
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:13,339
do? Why? Because he's not a significant character in God's Word. That portion that we just read,

863
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:17,380
that's pretty much everything that you're going to read about Oded. He was a prophet

864
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,260
of the Lord. God used him to make a difference. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Thank you

865
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:37,019
for loving us. I thank you that you have a plan. You have a plan to make yourself known

866
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:50,820
amongst the nations. You have a plan. And that plan includes us. It's amazing to consider

867
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,339
this morning that you would use us for your honor and for your glory. That you would use

868
00:44:55,339 --> 00:45:04,380
us to make a difference in people's lives. God, as we have just recently come off our

869
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:10,339
missions conference and now as we read this portion of scripture from the life of Oded,

870
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:19,459
God, I pray that you would help us this morning to be fully surrendered to thee. God, that

871
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:24,859
we'd get into your presence. That we'd have your touch upon us. That we'd be filled with

872
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:31,500
the power of the Holy Spirit of God. That we'd go forth with in obedience, with courage

873
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:42,380
and boldness. We'd make a difference in this lost and dying world. Natalie played a special

874
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:49,260
part. People need the Lord during our missions conference. What a great song. What a reminder

875
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:58,179
to us. People do need the Lord. God, you've chosen us. You've allowed us the privilege

876
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:03,940
of being able to tell those people about you. I pray then in the few moments of invitation

877
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,940
this morning that you'd have your will in way. I pray God that decisions would be made

878
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,700
that would bring honor and glory to thy name. That would help us all to be conformed to

879
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,100
the image of your dear son to impact eternity. I pray that you'd do in these few moments

880
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,299
what only you could do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
