1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Genesis chapter 19. And what a blessing to have the Bible, to have the Word of God. And we'll be

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,359
looking at the entirety of this chapter this evening. We started last week at verse number one.

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,959
And as we looked at Genesis 19 and verse number one, we really spent our time discussing the

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:24,639
progression of Lot. And we understand that as we looked over the life of Lot and looked at the

5
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:31,360
decision that was made when he first was separated from Abraham and after the contention,

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,360
the strife between his herdmen and the herdmen of Lot and of Abram, we find that the Bible told us

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:46,799
in Genesis chapter number 13 that he, Lot, he went and he pitched his tent toward Sodom. And we find

8
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,400
that there in Genesis 14 and verse number 13, the Bible tells us this about the men of Sodom,

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,880
that they were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. And it wasn't long after Lot pitched

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,680
his tent towards Sodom that he was living in Sodom. And then we find that as we looked at

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,919
Genesis 19 and verse number one, that he is sitting in the gate of Sodom. We find that it was in

12
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:15,360
Genesis chapter number 18 that God told Abraham that he would destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,440
of their wickedness. We find that God and the two angels, they come and they meet with Abraham and

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,839
they give him the news of that impending judgment, the wrath of God that would be poured out upon

15
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:33,680
these cities because of their wickedness. We find that it's here in Genesis chapter 19 that God

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,919
records for us the actual event of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Notice with me in verse

17
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:49,760
number 24, if you will, the Bible says this, then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah,

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,400
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. The title for the message, as you've seen in the

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,400
bulletin today, The Lord Destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. We'll be looking at verses two down

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,800
through verse number 38. But I want you to be mindful of the principle that we're taught in

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,880
Proverbs chapter 14. By way of introduction, I believe that it's important to note this principle

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,240
and this truth as we'll go through this passage of Scripture this evening. In Proverbs 14 and

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:30,240
verse 34, the Bible says this, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:40,559
people. We sang this morning, holy, holy, holy. Our God is holy and our God is just. He is merciful.

25
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:45,839
He is long-suffering. In fact, as we look at this passage of Scripture, though we are noting the

26
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:52,639
wrath and judgment of Almighty God, we understand that He's long-suffering. We understand that His

27
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,039
long-suffering is on display in these few chapters of the book of Genesis. He was aware of the

28
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,759
wickedness of the men of Sodom all the way back in chapter number 13. And yet we find that it's

29
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:12,399
until Genesis 19, some years that have passed by before that wrath of God is poured out.

30
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:19,440
Now, as we look at the passage this evening, I want you to first consider with me how the culture

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,039
influenced Lot's thinking. You understand that we're living in a wicked culture. We're living in a

32
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,279
wicked society. The Bible says that we're in the world, but we're not of the world. I'm thankful

33
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:35,279
this evening that my citizenship is in heaven. Yes, I'm a citizen of the United States of America,

34
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:40,720
but my citizenship is in heaven. We are living in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,800
We are living in the last days, and the Bible tells us some of the characteristics of the men

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,720
in the last days, and we're seeing those things around us. And no doubt in my mind, even as we

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,440
look here in Genesis chapter number 19, the culture influenced the way in which Lot was thinking.

38
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,839
By him pitching his tent towards Sodom, by him eventually living in Sodom, and then by him

39
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:13,919
sitting at the gate of Sodom, we find that this man Lot had his thinking influenced by the culture.

40
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,679
And if we're not careful, the culture will influence our thinking as well. We find that

41
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:27,279
it's the truth of this book. Truth is not relative. Truth has been declared in this book,

42
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,480
and we find that you don't have your truth, and my truth, and his truth, and her truth.

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,320
There's truth. And when we allow the truth of the Word of God to influence our thinking, we'll be

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,720
on God's side. Amen? And by the way, that's the most important side to be on, and the reality is

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,000
that if we're not careful, just as Lot's thinking was influenced by the culture, so also will our

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,760
culture influence our thinking. Notice with me, as we look at the passage of Scripture, the Bible

47
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,239
says in verse number two, and he said, Lot said, behold now, my lords, the two angels come, turn in, I

48
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:12,160
pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,760
early, and go on your ways. Do you notice how Lot wasn't very interested in them sticking around

50
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,399
for any length of time? He was going to show some hospitality, you get out of here tomorrow morning,

51
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:29,519
and be on your way, but we find that the Bible says that they said nay, but we will abide in the street

52
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,920
all night. Verse three, and he, Lot, pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him, and

53
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,519
entered into his house, and he made them a feast, and he did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

54
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,399
But before they lay down, the men of the city, remember these men are sinners exceedingly,

55
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,399
according to what we've understood as we've studied through the Scriptures, the Bible says

56
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,399
the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young,

57
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,399
all the people from every quarter, and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men

58
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:12,160
which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them. The wickedness of

59
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,519
their desire to get engaged in inappropriate relationships with these men that came unto the

60
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:26,000
home of Lot, and the Bible says in verse number six, notice, and Lot went out at the door unto them,

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,200
and shut the door after him. So get the picture. I mean, the Bible tells us that all of these folks,

62
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,359
all the people from every quarter, according to verse number four, they compassed the house

63
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:39,279
round, both old and young, and they're there. I mean, can you see it in your mind's eye? Can you

64
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,480
see what's happening? Lot allows these two angels to enter into his home, and all of the men of the

65
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,679
city show up, and they're ready. They say, Let these men come unto us, that we may know them.

66
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:55,600
And Lot steps out of the house, and he begins to engage in conversation with these men of the city,

67
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,959
and I want you to notice what he says in verse number seven, I pray you brethren,

68
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:14,239
do not so wickedly. Why is Lot calling these people brethren? Honestly, we use the term as

69
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:19,839
brothers and sisters in Christ. We find the New Testament uses the term of brethren pray for us.

70
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,720
What did Paul mean when he said that in first Thessalonians 5 24? He didn't just mean all of

71
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:31,440
God's creation of people pray for us. No, when he says brethren, he's speaking about people that

72
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,359
have been adopted into the family of God that are saved by the blood of Christ. We are brothers in

73
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:45,119
Christ. Amen? Brothers and sisters. And thus Paul says, Brethren, pray for us. There are a number of

74
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:51,519
examples in the New Testament of that word being used, and we find here that Lot, his thinking has

75
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,959
been influenced by the culture. He's been there for a period of time. He's been living in the city

76
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,320
since the 14th chapter of the book of Genesis, after that war and all that takes place, and of

77
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,079
course he was delivered back. And even after Abram went and delivered Lot, he went back to the city

78
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:17,519
of Sodom. And he says, Brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, notice how his thinking has been

79
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,160
influenced by the culture. Number one, he calls them brethren. Number two, notice what he offers

80
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,279
in verse number eight. I'm not sure if you can even really fully wrap your mind about the

81
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,320
just the wickedness and the depravity of the thinking of Lot in verse number eight.

82
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:43,679
He says, Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man. Let me, I pray you, bring them

83
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:51,679
out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes. Only unto these men do nothing, for

84
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:58,239
therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. Lot offered his two daughters to this wicked,

85
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:04,080
licentious mob. I can't even, I can't comprehend it, honestly.

86
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:17,520
The thinking of this culture, the morals or the immorals of this culture has influenced Lot. He's

87
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,280
beginning to think in a very wicked and immoral way. And he says to these men, I have two daughters,

88
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,960
and have them. Unbelievable that he would offer his daughters to this wicked and licentious mob.

89
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,599
We notice as we continue, I want you to skip down to verse number 16. Look at what happens.

90
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:42,400
And at this point, there's a number of things that have transpired with regard to the, let me just

91
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,119
read it. And they said in verse number nine, stand back. And they said again, this one fellow came

92
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:52,960
in to sojourn and he needs be a judge. Now will we deal worse with thee than with them? And they

93
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,200
pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. Can you see the, I mean,

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,840
is the way in which this mob

95
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,140
was so set on what they wanted.

96
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,720
And it says that in v. 10,

97
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
the men put forth their hand,

98
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,680
those of the angels,

99
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,520
and pulled Lot into the house to them

100
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,200
and shut to the door.

101
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
And it said they smote the men

102
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
that were at the door of the house

103
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
with blindness,

104
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
both small and great,

105
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
so that they wearied themselves

106
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
to find the door.

107
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,760
And the men said unto Lot,

108
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,240
hast thou here any besides?

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
Thine son-in-law, thy sons, thy daughters,

110
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,440
and whatsoever that hast in the city,

111
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,160
bring them out of this place.

112
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,520
Why? V. 13,

113
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,000
for we will destroy this place.

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Because of the cry of them as wax and grape

115
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
before the face of the Lord,

116
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,960
and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.

117
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
It's interesting to note what it says

118
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
in v. 16.

119
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
He'd been warned that they were going to destroy it.

120
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,560
And it says, while he lingered.

121
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
While he lingered.

122
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,600
Lot, what is wrong with you?

123
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I mean, he's lingering in this city

124
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,560
that the angels have said it's going to be destroyed

125
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,600
because of the wickedness.

126
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,560
And he's been so influenced

127
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,400
by the morals or the immorals,

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,120
the wickedness of this city

129
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,000
because he's pitched his tent toward it.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,080
He's dwelt there.

131
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
He's sitting in the gate of Sodom.

132
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,440
And now we find that he lingers

133
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,320
in the very city that the angels said,

134
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,280
get out of here because we're going to destroy it.

135
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Lot was a man that was fearful.

136
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
He was fearful.

137
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680
It's kind of interesting to see.

138
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,920
Look at v. 19.

139
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
In v. 17, they say,

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
escape for thy life.

141
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,200
Look not behind thee.

142
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,040
It tells them to escape to the mountain.

143
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
And Lot said, not so, my lord.

144
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,600
Behold now, look at v. 19,

145
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,640
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight

146
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,600
and thou hast magnified thy mercy

147
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,080
which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life.

148
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
And I cannot escape to the mountain

149
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,040
lest some evil take me and I die.

150
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,640
He was afraid to go to the mountain,

151
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,880
to go to the place where he was told to go.

152
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,440
And so we find that he continues and says,

153
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,880
behold now, this city is near to flee unto it

154
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
as a little one.

155
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,360
Oh, let me escape thither.

156
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
Is it not a little one?

157
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,400
And my soul shall live.

158
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
And he said unto him,

159
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,920
see, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also

160
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,120
that I will not overthrow this city

161
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,680
for the which thou hast spoken.

162
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,840
But look down to v. 30.

163
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,360
It says, and Lot went up out of Zoar,

164
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,560
which is the city that he was speaking about.

165
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
It says that he went up out of Zoar

166
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,120
and dwelt in the mountain

167
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
and his two daughters with him

168
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,880
for he feared to dwell in Zoar.

169
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,840
And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

170
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,160
Well, he was fearful to go to the mountain the first time.

171
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
So he desired to go to Zoar.

172
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,160
Then he's afraid to be in Zoar

173
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,400
and he goes to the mountain.

174
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
He's a man that's living in fear.

175
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
He has no peace.

176
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,120
And perhaps it's because of what we find

177
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,560
in the New Testament when the Bible says

178
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,800
that he vexed his righteous soul.

179
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,480
See, the reality is I've said often

180
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,040
that peace is not found in the absence of trouble,

181
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,800
but in the presence of God.

182
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,480
And when Lot is living in this wicked city,

183
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,160
when Lot is being influenced by the wickedness

184
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,960
of this Sodom and Gomorrah and their immoral behavior,

185
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,760
we find that Lot is in a place where he has no peace

186
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
and therefore he's living in fear.

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,800
We find here how that the culture

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
influenced the thinking of Lot.

189
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,320
Number two, I want you to consider

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,300
how the culture influenced Lot's family.

191
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,400
How the culture influenced Lot's family.

192
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,320
See, the reality this evening is that we remember

193
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,200
and we're aware of the fact that we have an enemy.

194
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,920
I said last week as we studied

195
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,960
and really just focused on that first verse

196
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,400
and looked at the progression of Lot over the years

197
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
and how he eventually got to the place

198
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,000
where he was sitting in the gate of Sodom.

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,280
And I mentioned this, how the enemy desires

200
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,440
to desensitize us to wickedness.

201
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,900
He wants us to come to a place

202
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,200
where we just begin to accept wickedness

203
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,540
as being not only accepted, but being normal.

204
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,380
It's allowed behavior, it's normal behavior,

205
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,640
it's the right, and so on and so forth.

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
And the enemy wants to cause us

207
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,120
to be desensitized to wickedness.

208
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,520
We find that not only does he want to be successful

209
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,800
in desensitizing us to wickedness,

210
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,320
but we find that he wants to desensitize your children

211
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,640
and your family to wickedness.

212
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
The reality is that Lot is in a place

213
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
where he should not be.

214
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,440
And unfortunately, his wife and his children

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
have been influenced by this culture.

216
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,880
I think that it would be safe to say,

217
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,559
as you look at the passage of Scripture,

218
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,880
that though Lot is referred to in the New Testament

219
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
as being a righteous man,

220
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,120
that most of his family did not follow the Lord Jehovah.

221
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,720
The reality this evening is that

222
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,480
when you look at the passage of Scripture

223
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,720
and you see what happens and what unfolds,

224
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,160
and you read how that he, Lot,

225
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
is given from these angels the responsibility

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,960
of going and getting his family,

227
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,160
we noticed already in v. 12

228
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,720
how that the men said unto Lot,

229
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,640
hast thou here any besides?

230
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,320
Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters,

231
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,160
and whatsoever thou hast in the city,

232
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,480
bring them out of this place.

233
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,680
The Bible tells us in v. 14,

234
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,200
and Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law.

235
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,040
I believe this evening that as you look at the passage,

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,720
that it would seem as if it was that very same night,

237
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
it was that night that these angels came,

238
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,720
and it was that night that Lot left his home

239
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,600
and he's going, and I don't know how far he had to travel

240
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,520
to get to the homes of his family members,

241
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,440
but we find that he's going

242
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,240
and he's taking this information to them,

243
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,920
and we find that Lot is giving them this.

244
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,200
We find in v. 15 it says, and when the morning arose,

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
and so we find that Lot spent some time that evening

246
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,360
going and giving a warning,

247
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,320
but notice how his family had been influenced by the culture.

248
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,600
It says in v. 14,

249
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
that Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law,

250
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
which married his daughters, and said,

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Up, get you out of this place,

252
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,559
for the Lord will destroy this city.

253
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,240
But he, Lot, seemed as one that mocked

254
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,840
unto his sons-in-law.

255
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,880
He had no influence over his children,

256
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,800
over his married daughters, his sons-in-law.

257
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
He did not have an influence over them, why?

258
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Because they'd been influenced by the culture.

259
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
You know, the reality is that the culture

260
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,160
wants to influence your children

261
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,360
more than you are influencing your children,

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,920
and you gotta be careful.

263
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,400
You should ask yourself the question this evening

264
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
as we look at this passage of Scripture,

265
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,279
and really we'll get to it at the end of the message,

266
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,880
but how is the culture influencing me?

267
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,480
How is the culture influencing my loved ones, my family?

268
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,120
How is the culture that we're living in influencing us?

269
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,640
Is the culture having a greater impact and influence on us

270
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,240
than the Word of God is?

271
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,200
We come to a place where Lot goes to his sons-in-law,

272
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,760
and we find that these married daughters

273
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,880
and these sons-in-laws,

274
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,400
they look at him as one that mocked.

275
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
They did not listen.

276
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,559
They did not respond to the warning that he would issue.

277
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,000
And the Bible says in v. 15,

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,080
when the morning arose,

279
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
then the angels hastened Lot, saying,

280
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,080
Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters,

281
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,400
which are here,

282
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,040
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

283
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,120
So we see the other family that is mentioned here

284
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
in v. 15, his wife and his two daughters.

285
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
Those are the same daughters that in v. 8

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,080
he was willing to offer to the men of the city.

287
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,400
Those are the two daughters that still lived in his home.

288
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,279
And we find that the Bible tells us

289
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,120
about the way in which the culture influenced his family,

290
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,760
not only in his married children,

291
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,680
but if you notice, also in the influence upon his wife.

292
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,800
We read a number of these verses already.

293
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Skip down, if you will, to v. 22.

294
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
The Bible says,

295
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,320
Haste thee, escape thither,

296
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,160
for I cannot do anything till thou become thither.

297
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

298
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,800
The sun was risen upon the earth

299
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,680
when Lot entered into Zoar.

300
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,840
Then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah,

301
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,320
a brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.

302
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,679
The Bible tells us that he had been given the instruction

303
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
in v. 17, escape for thy life, look not behind thee,

304
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,840
neither stay thou in all the plain,

305
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,640
escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

306
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,840
In v. 25, it says that he overthrew those cities

307
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,520
and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities

308
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,720
and that which grew upon the ground, look at v. 26,

309
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,359
but his wife looked back from behind him

310
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,520
and she became a pillar of salt.

311
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,359
Lot's wife had been influenced by the culture.

312
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,080
Why did she look back?

313
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,280
She had lived there for a number of years

314
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,160
at this particular time.

315
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
She had grown to operate within this culture

316
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,880
and within this society

317
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,520
and no doubt they had been influenced by the society

318
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,119
and she looks back and the Bible tells us

319
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,840
that she became a pillar of salt.

320
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,559
I believe really that this is a reference for us

321
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,600
to understand that sometimes sin and wickedness

322
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,960
has immediate consequences.

323
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,960
Sometimes when we're not careful,

324
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,760
we don't see the immediate consequences of our wickedness

325
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,359
and we think that God's okay with it.

326
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,400
Here when Lot, when they're fleeing the city,

327
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,160
when the Lord is destroying Sodom and Gomorrah,

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,359
Mrs. Lot turns back and she looks at the city

329
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,359
and she turns into a pillar of salt.

330
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,679
It's interesting to note that the Lord Jesus Christ said in Luke chapter 17,

331
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,519
remember Lot's wife.

332
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,719
Isn't that interesting?

333
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,839
Remember Lot's wife.

334
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,279
She looked back.

335
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,159
She became a pillar of salt.

336
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,159
I want you to consider with me the way in which the culture influenced his family,

337
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,239
not only his sons-in-law and his married daughters, his wife,

338
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,679
but I want you to consider the way in which it influenced his

339
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,239
daughters that were not married.

340
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:34,159
The Bible continues to tell us about these things that are taking place

341
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,799
and how that Lot feared to dwell in Zoar, as I read already in verse number 30.

342
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,879
And so he went and dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.

343
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,399
I will say this.

344
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:51,599
The two daughters of Lot were no longer in Sodom,

345
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,199
but Sodom was still in them.

346
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,679
They were no longer in the city.

347
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,999
They were no longer in Sodom, but Sodom was in them.

348
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:05,199
Why? They got influenced by the culture.

349
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:10,079
I've mentioned before how the book of Exodus reveals to us the Exodus,

350
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,839
the way in which God delivered His people from Egyptian bondage.

351
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,399
And when you read about the miracle of, many miracles in fact,

352
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,799
of all that God did to deliver His people out of Egyptian bondage,

353
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,599
we find that that's a picture of God getting His people out of the world.

354
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,119
And then you come to the book of Leviticus and you read all of these

355
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,999
truths with regard to the sacrificial system and the offerings and

356
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,439
all of these things that would take place and all that they were responsible for.

357
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:42,799
And I truly believe that as you study through the book of Leviticus

358
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,599
that really what you find is that God is taking the world out of His people.

359
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,839
He's already taken His people out of Egypt,

360
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,999
but now in the book of Leviticus, He's taking Egypt out of His people.

361
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,279
And here we would find that these two daughters of Lot,

362
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,599
they no longer were in Sodom, but Sodom was in them.

363
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,839
And it says this in verse number 34, excuse me, verse number 31.

364
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,839
And I'm not going to make a lot of comment here.

365
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,599
There's some younger children in the room.

366
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,039
I'm not going to make a ton of comment,

367
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,519
but I want you to understand the level of depravity.

368
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,119
The incestuous relationship that took place

369
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,439
is beyond comprehension for this preacher.

370
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,039
It says this,

371
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,199
The firstborn said unto the younger,

372
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:36,319
Our father is old, and there's not a man in the earth

373
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,519
to come in unto us after the matter of all the earth.

374
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,959
Come, let us make our father drink wine,

375
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:49,359
and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father.

376
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:52,559
And they made their father drink wine that night.

377
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,519
And the firstborn went in and lay with her father,

378
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,919
and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

379
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,959
And it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger,

380
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,119
Behold, I lay yesterday night with my father.

381
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,719
Let us make him drink wine this night also,

382
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:15,839
and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father.

383
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,799
And they made their father drink wine that night also.

384
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,639
And the younger arose and lay with him,

385
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:25,279
and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

386
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,759
It says in verse number 36,

387
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:35,439
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

388
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:39,919
It's just wicked.

389
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,799
If Lot's wife is a picture of immediate consequence,

390
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,159
I would say that the daughters of Lot is a picture of long-term consequence.

391
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,479
The Bible tells us in verse 37,

392
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:57,839
And the firstborn bare a son and called his name Moab,

393
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,799
the same as the father of the Moabites unto this day.

394
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,239
And the younger, she also bare a son and called his name Ben-Ammai,

395
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,599
the same as the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

396
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,879
As you read your Bible,

397
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:14,079
are you familiar with the terms the Moabites and the Ammonites?

398
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,519
You read about the Moabites,

399
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,799
and you read about the Ammonites,

400
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,000
and you read about the various battles and various ways

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,319
in which they were the enemies of God's people,

402
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,719
and the reality is that it's a direct result

403
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:30,799
of the incestuous relationship that took place in Genesis 19.

404
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,079
It's a long-term consequence.

405
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,000
Wicked.

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,199
Wicked.

407
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:40,399
Ungodly.

408
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,319
This evening, the culture of Sodom and Gomorrah,

409
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:50,399
the society, influenced Lot's thinking.

410
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,319
The culture, the society, influenced Lot's family.

411
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,199
This evening, I would ask this question in our final point.

412
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,199
How does the record of Genesis 19,

413
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:10,079
or how should the record of Genesis 19 influence believers today?

414
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,079
What warnings should we receive from a passage of Scripture such as this?

415
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,919
In 1980, John Phillips, he's with the Lord now,

416
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,639
he's a great pastor, man of God,

417
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,000
and he made some comments in some of his writings

418
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,199
about these cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

419
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,039
And as we begin to think about the ways

420
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
in which the text of Scripture should influence us

421
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
as the people of God today,

422
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,000
I thought it pertinent to read these two excerpts.

423
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,399
John Phillips said this.

424
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,919
From now on, the spotlight swings from the filthiness of Sodom

425
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,319
to the situation that existed in Lot's own family.

426
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,239
I just dealt with that.

427
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,279
But he says this.

428
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,119
It shows what the philosophy of Sodom

429
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,559
had done to the thinking of a believing man.

430
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,119
Notice this.

431
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,279
This is the application that he makes.

432
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,559
Truly, we cannot keep on imbibing the world's ideologies

433
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,439
without becoming tainted ourselves.

434
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,839
1980 he said that.

435
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,000
How true.

436
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,039
We cannot allow the ideologies,

437
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,799
imbibing in the world's ideologies

438
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,759
without becoming tainted ourselves.

439
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,479
He said this.

440
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:34,639
The unholy lust of those men were pugnacious,

441
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,879
no longer did the perverts practice

442
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,359
their abominations in secret,

443
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,839
ostracized by the rest of the community.

444
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,839
No longer were their shameful sins

445
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,799
tolerated by a permissive society

446
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,799
as something people had a right to practice if they pleased.

447
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,319
It had gone far beyond that.

448
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,879
Now the people were an open, aggressive,

449
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,599
insistent force in the city

450
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,839
with which none dared interfere.

451
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,679
For their behavior was not looked upon

452
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,759
by the Sodomites as criminal,

453
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,000
but as constitutional.

454
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,119
Wow.

455
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,279
2021.

456
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,559
This was written in 1980.

457
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,239
He says of the people in Sodom

458
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,399
that they were not looking at these acts

459
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,759
as being criminal,

460
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,439
but as constitutional.

461
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,679
They had the constitutional right

462
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,079
to indulge their passions

463
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,359
to indulge their passions

464
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,159
when and where they wished

465
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,000
and any attempt to thwart them

466
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,159
could be expected to lead to open riot in the city.

467
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,279
41 years later,

468
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:47,759
is it not more pertinent today than even then?

469
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,679
This is nothing new.

470
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,639
It's in our face though.

471
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:56,959
Amen?

472
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,039
It is in our face.

473
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,359
Let me read three passages from the New Testament.

474
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,639
Luke 17.

475
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,479
These are the words of Jesus Christ

476
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:07,359
as He is ministering during His earthly ministry

477
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,639
and He's using here

478
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,439
some things with regard to the end times

479
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,079
and what have you.

480
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,919
He used the illustration of Noah.

481
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,439
And then He begins to use the illustration

482
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,319
of the days of Lot.

483
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,399
Notice in v. 28 of Luke 17.

484
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,119
In Luke 17 and v. 28,

485
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,759
the Bible says,

486
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,479
likewise also as it was in the days of Lot,

487
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,759
they did eat,

488
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,479
they drank,

489
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,119
they bought,

490
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,759
they sold,

491
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,559
they planted,

492
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,439
they builded.

493
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom,

494
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
it rained fire and brimstone from heaven

495
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
and destroyed them all.

496
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,359
It's v. 32 where He mentioned earlier

497
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,159
where the Bible says,

498
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,799
remember Lot's wife.

499
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,239
I want you to notice what the Bible says

500
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,760
in 2 Peter 2.

501
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,880
2 Peter 2.

502
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,440
In verses 6-9,

503
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,880
Peter dealing with the false teachers

504
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,559
and dealing with

505
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,479
not only the way in which they do business,

506
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,159
but the way in which they'll be judged.

507
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
He uses the example of the angels

508
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,880
that sin in v. 4.

509
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,159
He used the example of the flood in v. 5.

510
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,000
And then in v. 6-9,

511
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
he used the example of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah.

512
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
The Bible says this in v. 6.

513
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

514
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,359
into ashes condemned them with an overthrow.

515
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,559
Making them an ensample unto those

516
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
that after should live ungodly.

517
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,519
So we see a reference to them being an example.

518
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,320
Notice v. 7.

519
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
And delivered just Lot vexed

520
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,239
with the filthy conversation of the wicked

521
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,279
for that righteous man dwelling among them

522
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul

523
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
from day to day with their unlawful deeds.

524
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,359
Turn to the little book of Jude, if you will.

525
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,320
The book of Jude, again,

526
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,000
the problem that Jude is addressing

527
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
in this very short book

528
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,279
is that of false teachers that had crept...

529
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:07,279
in unawares, that turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, literally unbridled lust.

530
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,039
And we find that they are being disgust in their actions, and then again, here Jude will

531
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,799
use the examples of those that had faced punishment, the judgment of God, and in verse number seven

532
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,399
he uses the example of Sodom and Gomorrah that we're studying here in Genesis 19.

533
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,239
The Bible says, "...even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner,

534
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:34,199
giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for

535
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:38,639
an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal life."

536
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:44,179
The wicked and immoral behavior of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah has been documented.

537
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,519
We understood as we started studying the life of Abraham, really going through here the

538
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,719
book of Genesis, that it was there in chapter number 13 that we first begin reading about

539
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,919
the wickedness of the people that dwelt in Sodom and Gomorrah.

540
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,159
And we find that that wickedness has been documented, and eventually, as we're reading

541
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,799
here in Genesis 19, the wrath of God was unleashed and these cities were destroyed.

542
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:15,039
I would submit to you this evening that we too are living in a time in which the judgment

543
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,639
hand of God will be poured upon wickedness.

544
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,839
Our God is just.

545
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,399
Our God is perfect.

546
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:26,399
He's holy.

547
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,399
He's long-suffering.

548
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:31,719
And I would say this this evening, we ought never mistake the long-suffering of God for

549
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,599
His approval.

550
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,699
God never approves wickedness.

551
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:38,279
He never approves sinful behavior.

552
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,719
And at times we may be experiencing and we may be seeing the long-suffering of God, the

553
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:48,359
way in which we would notice it here even in Genesis with regard to Sodom and Gomorrah,

554
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,079
and the way in which it was in chapter 13 that we're aware of the wickedness, there

555
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:59,079
were exceeding sinners, sinners exceedingly, that it's there that God's long-suffering,

556
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,399
it's not until chapter 19 in which they're destroyed, but we understand that God's long-suffering

557
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,799
should never be mistaken with God's approval.

558
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,999
God is not okay with sin.

559
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,519
He's just not.

560
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:22,439
Today we find ourselves living in a culture, living in a society, that is not only allowing

561
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:29,799
and approving, but celebrating wickedness.

562
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,639
They are celebrating the very wickedness that resulted in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

563
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:39,439
in our day, today.

564
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:47,879
And it's a, as John Phillips said in 1980, it's a constitutional right.

565
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,039
It's where we live.

566
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,599
It's where we live.

567
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,159
But how do we respond?

568
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,719
How do we allow the record of Genesis 19 to influence us?

569
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:07,679
See, because the reality is that we too as a nation are going to face judgment.

570
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,199
Sin is a reproach to any people.

571
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:16,639
There's nothing particularly special about the United States of America that just because

572
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:20,159
we're Americans, we're not going to face judgment.

573
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,959
It doesn't work that way.

574
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:26,219
God is no respecter of persons, amen?

575
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:34,039
And the reality is that we're living in a time in which not only is the wickedness allowed,

576
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:40,299
but it goes to another step altogether when it is celebrated.

577
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:45,679
It's a completely disdain in God's eyes.

578
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:52,519
And it's a group of people, a culture that literally, figuratively, however you want

579
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,119
to look at it, it's as if they shake their fists at God and say, we're going to do what

580
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,119
we want to do.

581
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,199
And that's where we live.

582
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:04,159
So we're either going to be influenced by the culture that we're living in, and we're

583
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,999
going to say, well, you know, that's what the law says, and that's what's, or we're

584
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:18,599
going to allow an account such as Genesis 19 to influence us to say right is right and

585
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,519
wrong is wrong.

586
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,239
Sin is sin.

587
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,799
It doesn't mean that we don't love people.

588
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:28,279
It doesn't mean that we don't want people to be saved.

589
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:32,999
Listen, I am not in any way, shape, or form saying, oh, I wish God would rain down fire

590
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:35,199
and brimstone and destroy people.

591
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,119
No, because I understand when people die, they're going to spend eternity in the lake

592
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,479
of fire if they're not saved.

593
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:48,639
My heart breaks for people that are blinded by the God of this world.

594
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,399
They need to be saved.

595
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,439
They need to be saved.

596
00:34:52,439 --> 00:35:00,559
They need to be lovingly given the truth of God's Word.

597
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,319
God loves everybody.

598
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,679
God loves.

599
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,519
God is love.

600
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:13,119
But God has stated in His Word what is right and what is wrong, correct?

601
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,839
He's made it clear.

602
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,919
And it does not matter if in Judah, according to Isaiah, they're legislating wickedness,

603
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:26,239
or in the United States of America today that they legislate wickedness, God is the judge

604
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,439
of the earth.

605
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:34,679
And so if the land, if the justice system in the land is corrupt, you can rest assured

606
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,839
that God is not corrupt.

607
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,999
He's a righteous judge.

608
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,879
Amen?

609
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:45,759
It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

610
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:47,799
I don't want to face the judgment of God.

611
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:53,479
Listen, I believe that it's time for us, even as it was in the time of Nehemiah, that we

612
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:57,159
begin to weep for our nation.

613
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,999
Because I'm telling you, our nation is ripe for judgment.

614
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:03,119
Sin is a reproach to any people.

615
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,519
How could we be influenced by this particular passage of Scripture?

616
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,799
Number one, I would say this, we're to have no friendship with the world.

617
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:15,719
Now understand, when I use the terminology world, I'm using it in the biblical sense

618
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,639
of the world's philosophy, the philosophy of the world.

619
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,719
We're to have no friendship with the world.

620
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,079
I understand that we need to reach people with the gospel, and there are times in which

621
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,599
we need to befriend people and be a friend to people and show them the love of Christ.

622
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,679
And so I'm not suggesting it in that sense of the word, but I'm saying this, we have

623
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,079
to understand this world has a system.

624
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,879
There is a biblical worldview, and then there's a worldview.

625
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:53,159
And the worldview is in direct opposition to God's biblical worldview.

626
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,519
And so we're to have no friendship with the world.

627
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,759
Notice in the book of James, if you will, James 4, we're familiar with the passage of

628
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:13,719
Scripture, and James 4, in verse number 4, James 4, in verse number 4, the Word of God

629
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:20,159
says this, "'Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world

630
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,639
is enmity with God?

631
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,799
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.'"

632
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:36,039
I don't want to be a friend of the world in the sense of this passage of Scripture.

633
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:42,039
The reality this evening is that Lot paid a great price.

634
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,099
Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed, but, you know, he had married children that were destroyed

635
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,679
in that city.

636
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,319
He had a wife that turned to a pillar of salt.

637
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:56,519
He had two daughters that committed great wickedness.

638
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:03,639
Do you think for a moment that when Lot pitched his tent towards Sodom, and when he said,

639
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,359
hey guys, we're moving into Sodom, there's a nice house over here for sale, and it began

640
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:12,559
to get influenced, do you think that he considered that was going to be the end result, what

641
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,959
we studied tonight in Genesis 19?

642
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,599
If so, he'd be an absolute idiot to do what he did.

643
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:22,719
It's not what he thought was going to happen.

644
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,159
And here's what happens in our lives today.

645
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,119
We think, oh, it's not really going to affect me.

646
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,119
It's not going to affect my kids.

647
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,959
It's not going to affect, no, no, be careful.

648
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,559
Friendship with the world is enmity with God.

649
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,119
So what do we learn from Genesis 19?

650
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,119
How are we influenced by the text of Scripture before us here in Genesis 19?

651
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,199
Well, we're to have no friendship with the world.

652
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,479
Let me say this, we're to have no love for the world.

653
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:50,159
Again, in the sense of what we're dealing with, with the world system.

654
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,999
Notice what the Bible says in Romans chapter number 12.

655
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:59,879
The preacher this morning, he referenced this passage of Scripture when he dealt with sacrifice

656
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,719
and how important it is that we would present our bodies a living sacrifice unto the Lord

657
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,519
and how appropriate that is.

658
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,319
But I want you to notice verses one and two together here in Romans chapter 12.

659
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:12,759
Notice Paul says this, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you

660
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:17,919
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable

661
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:25,559
service and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your

662
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:31,239
mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

663
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,599
We're not to be conformed to this world, but how are we going to avoid being conformed

664
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,599
to this world?

665
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,759
We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.

666
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:40,159
How does that happen?

667
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,919
By getting into this book.

668
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:46,519
I mean, it's just that simple, really.

669
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,919
There's nothing complicated about it.

670
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:54,999
It just means that you have to spend time in the Word and allow the Word to influence

671
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:55,999
you.

672
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:59,039
So we're living in a world in which they're trying to, again...

673
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,999
the celebration of wickedness, and the way in which they want to force everything upon

674
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,359
us.

675
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,479
By the way, they're the people that say that they're tolerant.

676
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:16,479
But the reality is that they're tolerant of anything and anyone that's not a Bible-believing

677
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,479
Christian.

678
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,559
That's just the bottom line.

679
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,799
And the reality this evening, that's what we're living in.

680
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,719
That's what we're dealing with.

681
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,359
And so how do we operate in such a society?

682
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,119
How do we operate in such a culture?

683
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,599
How do we not get influenced?

684
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,119
How do we prevent our kids from being influenced by that?

685
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,199
We must get into the book.

686
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,679
And listen, I don't have to approve of your wickedness.

687
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:44,799
I'm not suggesting that I'm going out and picketing and all of these crazy things that

688
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:50,759
some people go to an extreme, but I'm simply saying I do not have to compromise my biblical

689
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:54,439
beliefs because of what you want to do.

690
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:58,719
If you want to do it, by all means, you can do what you want.

691
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,359
We believe that, don't we?

692
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,639
We believe in the sole liberty of individuals.

693
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,239
You don't have to believe that Jesus is the only way, but one day you're going to stand

694
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,559
before him and find out that he's the only way.

695
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,999
So why do I go and tell people about being saved because I understand the truth, but

696
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,079
I don't force anybody to get saved?

697
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:28,719
Do they want to force us to follow their thinking and their morals or lack thereof?

698
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,119
No, we love not the world.

699
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,999
Notice this in 1 John 2, notice what the Word of God says.

700
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,999
These are verses that we're familiar with.

701
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:40,439
These are verses that I've preached from before.

702
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:52,179
In 1 John 2 and verse 15, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

703
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:55,599
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

704
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,999
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the

705
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:02,319
pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world, and the world passeth away and

706
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,479
the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

707
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:13,599
Let me ask you this, does Jesus love?

708
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,319
Did Jesus love when he was on this earth during his earthly ministry?

709
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,679
We sing, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so, right?

710
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,839
I am so glad that my Father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given.

711
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,439
Wonderful things in the Bible I see.

712
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:33,599
This is the dearest that Jesus loves me.

713
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:37,199
Jesus loved during his earthly ministry, but you know what he did?

714
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:44,119
He stood before people and he caught them out for their wickedness, because he loved.

715
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,879
Not because of any other reason, and it doesn't suggest that Jesus didn't love because he

716
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:53,439
said what their wicked sin was.

717
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:58,119
Love is not permissive, that's the way that the culture wants to tell us it is.

718
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,479
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

719
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,879
Listen, when we truly demonstrate love for someone, you know what it is, it's telling

720
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:05,879
them the truth.

721
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:10,079
It's telling them the truth.

722
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:17,439
If you go to a doctor, Ronnie, can I use you as an example tonight, is that alright?

723
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:22,239
I sat with Ronnie, he had to go to the doctor for an MRI earlier this year, and there was

724
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,279
a possibility that Ronnie was going to have cancer.

725
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:28,239
He didn't know.

726
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,879
But you know what Ronnie desired?

727
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:31,879
That the doctor would tell him the truth.

728
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:32,879
Right?

729
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:38,359
Doc, if I have cancer, tell me I have cancer, let's deal with it, let's get what we need

730
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:39,359
to get done.

731
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,959
Ronnie didn't desire to go to the doctor and the doctor say, oh, everything's fine,

732
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,639
you're good.

733
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,319
And the doctor knows that he's full of cancer and he sends him home and tells him he's fine.

734
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,639
No, tell me the truth.

735
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,219
Right?

736
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:59,299
So the greatest way to demonstrate love is by telling somebody the truth.

737
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,099
Listen, God loves you.

738
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,979
He's not okay with sin and wickedness.

739
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:08,859
He doesn't accept ungodliness.

740
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,699
He is the savior of the world.

741
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,659
He died for you because he loves you.

742
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:19,459
And this is the offer that he makes, he'll save you.

743
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:21,499
They don't have to accept it.

744
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:24,419
We never force anyone to accept it.

745
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:25,619
We just go on.

746
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,259
And if they accept it, man, glory to God, a sinner saved by grace.

747
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:33,259
We now get to give them the truth of God's word and teach them all things whatsoever

748
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:35,459
I have commanded you.

749
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,819
Amen?

750
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:40,539
But love tells the truth.

751
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:45,499
Love doesn't put their arm around somebody and say, everything's going to be okay, everything's

752
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:47,299
fine.

753
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:50,939
Do you know that that's not the truth?

754
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,979
Do you know that people are going to stand before God?

755
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:56,459
Sure we do.

756
00:44:56,459 --> 00:45:00,859
Lot told his sons-in-law and his daughters, no doubt they were there, this city is going

757
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:01,859
to be destroyed.

758
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:03,859
Was that truth?

759
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:06,779
Could he force them to come?

760
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:09,579
Were they destroyed?

761
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,019
Yes.

762
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:14,619
We have no friendship with the world.

763
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:15,619
We have no love for the world.

764
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:22,339
I would say this, finally this evening, we're going to be unspotted from the world.

765
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:23,339
Unspotted from the world.

766
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:32,059
Notice what James says, James chapter number one.

767
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:39,939
You know that this world is trying to influence us, trying to spot us, amen?

768
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:42,859
The world's trying to influence us.

769
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:46,339
In James one and verse number 27, the Bible says, pure religion and undefiled before God

770
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:51,059
and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep

771
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:56,419
himself unspotted from the world.

772
00:45:56,419 --> 00:46:05,659
Notice how Paul says it to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians 5 and verse number 27.

773
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:09,979
In fact, in verse 26, it's appropriate to read with it, in Ephesians 5 and verse 26,

774
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:14,419
the Bible says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the

775
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:21,699
word that he might present it, speaking of the church, to himself a glorious church,

776
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:29,499
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.

777
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:35,859
We're to be unspotted from the world, not being tainted by the world.

778
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:39,539
And so how do we live in such a society?

779
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:42,699
We're in the world, but we're not of the world, right?

780
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:46,359
That's what Jesus said in John 17 when he prayed.

781
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,899
He said, keep them from the evil, sanctify them through thy word, thy word is truth.

782
00:46:52,899 --> 00:47:00,579
And so we can, in fact, it is our duty to live according to what Paul says in Philippians

783
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:07,419
2 and verse number 15, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke

784
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:16,499
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world.

785
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:20,059
This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.

786
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,299
We sing it with the kids.

787
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:29,259
The reality this evening is that we are living in such a time of living in the midst of a

788
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:38,139
crooked and perverse nation, but we are to shine as lights in the world.

789
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:48,539
God uses us as His witnesses, and there's right and there's wrong.

790
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:55,379
And this evening, when we look at the record of Genesis 19 and the destruction of Sodom

791
00:47:55,379 --> 00:48:02,459
and Gomorrah, when we begin to follow the text of Scripture, we understand tonight how

792
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:07,899
the culture influenced the thinking of Lot.

793
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:12,539
We understand how the culture influenced the family of Lot.

794
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:17,939
But I just wonder tonight, are we as God's people today going to allow Genesis 19 and

795
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:21,899
the record contained therein to influence us?

796
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:29,419
Listen, we live in a wicked time, and the message that I'm preaching tonight is not

797
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:31,459
very popular.

798
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:34,219
Amen?

799
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,739
Second Timothy chapter number four, though, said preach the word.

800
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:40,659
Be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and

801
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,059
doctrine.

802
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,820
The time is going to come when men will not endorse sound doctrine.

803
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,339
We're there.

804
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:49,139
They want you to tickle, it's their ears, right?

805
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:50,139
Tickle their ears.

806
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,219
In fact, you know, I was reading through the book of Isaiah, and they said of the prophets,

807
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:57,259
we don't really want you to tell us the truth.

808
00:48:57,259 --> 00:49:00,820
Just tell us something that's going to make us feel good.

809
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,579
We live in that type of a society.

810
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:10,619
But tonight, our God is a righteous God.

811
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:19,659
And he said in his word, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

812
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:28,459
And we're living in a nation where we've not just allowed or approved, but we have

813
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:33,940
started to celebrate wickedness.

814
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,419
And I say to you this evening, I'm concerned for our nation.

815
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:39,579
And I'm concerned for you.

816
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:45,099
I'm concerned for our families, that we're not influenced by this culture.

817
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:51,779
We, as the people of God, are called to influence the culture.

818
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:54,659
Not that the culture would influence us.

819
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,019
One of the problems...

820
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:06,339
in the church in Corinth, many problems, but one of the problems was that they were being

821
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:13,259
more influenced by the city than they were influencing the city.

822
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:19,459
There's a Greek term that was used during the time of the writing of 1 Corinthians and

823
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:25,379
2 Corinthians and when Paul went to the city of Corinth, karynthosiam, and it was to act

824
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:26,459
as a Corinthian.

825
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,499
And here's what it meant.

826
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:34,619
When you live immorally and ungodly, they would use that term to say you're acting and

827
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,139
living like a Corinthian.

828
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:38,739
That's how wicked it was.

829
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:43,139
But the church was being influenced by the society and God has always said that the church

830
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:48,059
is supposed to influence the society, not the other way around.

831
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:52,379
This evening, I hope that we would take heed to the truth of Genesis 19.

832
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:54,219
We'd see the destruction.

833
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:58,139
It's terrible.

834
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:05,219
We'd see the way in which they're influenced and we would guard against it, evaluate it.

835
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:07,659
How is this culture influencing me?

836
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:13,019
If you have children, how is this culture influencing my children?

837
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:19,139
I would say this, and I'll say that I'm going to go out on a limb, but I'll say this.

838
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:27,659
This culture is influencing your children more than you think it is, truly.

839
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:31,219
This culture is influencing your children more than you think it is, and we're in a

840
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:38,419
place this evening, we've got to live godly and righteously in this present world.

841
00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:40,699
We need to be lights.

842
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:46,739
By the way, the darker the night, the brighter the light, amen?

843
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:51,619
And we need to clean our lens so that that light shines forth.

844
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:52,619
Let's pray.

845
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,059
Father, we love You.

846
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,899
We thank You for loving us.

847
00:51:56,899 --> 00:52:02,219
As we examine this passage of Scripture, I pray that we'd be honest in our evaluation,

848
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:07,499
that we would be influenced by the truth contained therein.

849
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,819
God that we'd understand the way in which Lot was influenced by the culture, the way

850
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:17,099
in which his family was influenced, that we would guard against it.

851
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,499
Lord, help us to have no friendship with the world.

852
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:21,739
Help us not to love the world.

853
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:26,079
Help us to remain unspotted from this world.

854
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:37,459
Would You help us, God, to live the way that we're supposed to live, godly, righteously?

855
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:43,939
Would You help us to shine as lights in this wicked and perverse generation, understanding

856
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:50,379
that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not?

857
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:55,259
You said this in that same passage, that if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

858
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,979
are lost.

859
00:52:56,979 --> 00:53:02,739
Would You help us tonight to recognize the greatest way that we can love an individual

860
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:05,419
is by telling them the truth?

861
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:08,419
I understand that it might not be pleasant.

862
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:13,859
I understand that it might cost us something, even as the preacher preached this morning.

863
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:17,339
Would You help us to be willing to pay the price?

864
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:20,299
Would You move and work as only You can in this time of invitation?

865
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:21,779
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

866
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:22,379
Would You stand with us?
