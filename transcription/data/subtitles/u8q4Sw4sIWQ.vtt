00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Genesis chapter 19. And what a blessing to have the Bible, to have the Word of God. And we'll be

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.359
looking at the entirety of this chapter this evening. We started last week at verse number one.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:16.959
And as we looked at Genesis 19 and verse number one, we really spent our time discussing the

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:24.639
progression of Lot. And we understand that as we looked over the life of Lot and looked at the

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:31.360
decision that was made when he first was separated from Abraham and after the contention,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.360
the strife between his herdmen and the herdmen of Lot and of Abram, we find that the Bible told us

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.799
in Genesis chapter number 13 that he, Lot, he went and he pitched his tent toward Sodom. And we find

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.400
that there in Genesis 14 and verse number 13, the Bible tells us this about the men of Sodom,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.880
that they were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. And it wasn't long after Lot pitched

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.680
his tent towards Sodom that he was living in Sodom. And then we find that as we looked at

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.919
Genesis 19 and verse number one, that he is sitting in the gate of Sodom. We find that it was in

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:15.360
Genesis chapter number 18 that God told Abraham that he would destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.440
of their wickedness. We find that God and the two angels, they come and they meet with Abraham and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.839
they give him the news of that impending judgment, the wrath of God that would be poured out upon

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:33.680
these cities because of their wickedness. We find that it's here in Genesis chapter 19 that God

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.919
records for us the actual event of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Notice with me in verse

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:49.760
number 24, if you will, the Bible says this, then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.400
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. The title for the message, as you've seen in the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.400
bulletin today, The Lord Destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. We'll be looking at verses two down

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.800
through verse number 38. But I want you to be mindful of the principle that we're taught in

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.880
Proverbs chapter 14. By way of introduction, I believe that it's important to note this principle

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.240
and this truth as we'll go through this passage of Scripture this evening. In Proverbs 14 and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:30.240
verse 34, the Bible says this, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.559
people. We sang this morning, holy, holy, holy. Our God is holy and our God is just. He is merciful.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:45.839
He is long-suffering. In fact, as we look at this passage of Scripture, though we are noting the

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:52.639
wrath and judgment of Almighty God, we understand that He's long-suffering. We understand that His

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:59.039
long-suffering is on display in these few chapters of the book of Genesis. He was aware of the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:05.759
wickedness of the men of Sodom all the way back in chapter number 13. And yet we find that it's

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:12.399
until Genesis 19, some years that have passed by before that wrath of God is poured out.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:19.440
Now, as we look at the passage this evening, I want you to first consider with me how the culture

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.039
influenced Lot's thinking. You understand that we're living in a wicked culture. We're living in a

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:29.279
wicked society. The Bible says that we're in the world, but we're not of the world. I'm thankful

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:35.279
this evening that my citizenship is in heaven. Yes, I'm a citizen of the United States of America,

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:40.720
but my citizenship is in heaven. We are living in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.800
We are living in the last days, and the Bible tells us some of the characteristics of the men

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.720
in the last days, and we're seeing those things around us. And no doubt in my mind, even as we

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.440
look here in Genesis chapter number 19, the culture influenced the way in which Lot was thinking.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.839
By him pitching his tent towards Sodom, by him eventually living in Sodom, and then by him

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:13.919
sitting at the gate of Sodom, we find that this man Lot had his thinking influenced by the culture.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.679
And if we're not careful, the culture will influence our thinking as well. We find that

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:27.279
it's the truth of this book. Truth is not relative. Truth has been declared in this book,

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:32.480
and we find that you don't have your truth, and my truth, and his truth, and her truth.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.320
There's truth. And when we allow the truth of the Word of God to influence our thinking, we'll be

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.720
on God's side. Amen? And by the way, that's the most important side to be on, and the reality is

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.000
that if we're not careful, just as Lot's thinking was influenced by the culture, so also will our

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.760
culture influence our thinking. Notice with me, as we look at the passage of Scripture, the Bible

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.239
says in verse number two, and he said, Lot said, behold now, my lords, the two angels come, turn in, I

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:12.160
pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.760
early, and go on your ways. Do you notice how Lot wasn't very interested in them sticking around

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.399
for any length of time? He was going to show some hospitality, you get out of here tomorrow morning,

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:29.519
and be on your way, but we find that the Bible says that they said nay, but we will abide in the street

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:35.920
all night. Verse three, and he, Lot, pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him, and

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.519
entered into his house, and he made them a feast, and he did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:48.399
But before they lay down, the men of the city, remember these men are sinners exceedingly,

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.399
according to what we've understood as we've studied through the Scriptures, the Bible says

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:58.399
the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young,

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:04.399
all the people from every quarter, and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:12.160
which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them. The wickedness of

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.519
their desire to get engaged in inappropriate relationships with these men that came unto the

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:26.000
home of Lot, and the Bible says in verse number six, notice, and Lot went out at the door unto them,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.200
and shut the door after him. So get the picture. I mean, the Bible tells us that all of these folks,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.359
all the people from every quarter, according to verse number four, they compassed the house

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:39.279
round, both old and young, and they're there. I mean, can you see it in your mind's eye? Can you

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.480
see what's happening? Lot allows these two angels to enter into his home, and all of the men of the

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.679
city show up, and they're ready. They say, Let these men come unto us, that we may know them.

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:55.600
And Lot steps out of the house, and he begins to engage in conversation with these men of the city,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.959
and I want you to notice what he says in verse number seven, I pray you brethren,

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:14.239
do not so wickedly. Why is Lot calling these people brethren? Honestly, we use the term as

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:19.839
brothers and sisters in Christ. We find the New Testament uses the term of brethren pray for us.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:24.720
What did Paul mean when he said that in first Thessalonians 5 24? He didn't just mean all of

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:31.440
God's creation of people pray for us. No, when he says brethren, he's speaking about people that

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.359
have been adopted into the family of God that are saved by the blood of Christ. We are brothers in

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:45.119
Christ. Amen? Brothers and sisters. And thus Paul says, Brethren, pray for us. There are a number of

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:51.519
examples in the New Testament of that word being used, and we find here that Lot, his thinking has

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:56.959
been influenced by the culture. He's been there for a period of time. He's been living in the city

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.320
since the 14th chapter of the book of Genesis, after that war and all that takes place, and of

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.079
course he was delivered back. And even after Abram went and delivered Lot, he went back to the city

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:17.519
of Sodom. And he says, Brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, notice how his thinking has been

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:22.160
influenced by the culture. Number one, he calls them brethren. Number two, notice what he offers

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.279
in verse number eight. I'm not sure if you can even really fully wrap your mind about the

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.320
just the wickedness and the depravity of the thinking of Lot in verse number eight.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:43.679
He says, Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man. Let me, I pray you, bring them

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:51.679
out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes. Only unto these men do nothing, for

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:58.239
therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. Lot offered his two daughters to this wicked,

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:04.080
licentious mob. I can't even, I can't comprehend it, honestly.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:17.520
The thinking of this culture, the morals or the immorals of this culture has influenced Lot. He's

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:25.280
beginning to think in a very wicked and immoral way. And he says to these men, I have two daughters,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.960
and have them. Unbelievable that he would offer his daughters to this wicked and licentious mob.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.599
We notice as we continue, I want you to skip down to verse number 16. Look at what happens.

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:42.400
And at this point, there's a number of things that have transpired with regard to the, let me just

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.119
read it. And they said in verse number nine, stand back. And they said again, this one fellow came

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:52.960
in to sojourn and he needs be a judge. Now will we deal worse with thee than with them? And they

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.200
pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. Can you see the, I mean,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.840
is the way in which this mob

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.140
was so set on what they wanted.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.720
And it says that in v. 10,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.440
the men put forth their hand,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.680
those of the angels,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.520
and pulled Lot into the house to them

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.200
and shut to the door.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.800
And it said they smote the men

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.880
that were at the door of the house

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.240
with blindness,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.480
both small and great,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.960
so that they wearied themselves

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.720
to find the door.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.760
And the men said unto Lot,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.240
hast thou here any besides?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.360
Thine son-in-law, thy sons, thy daughters,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.440
and whatsoever that hast in the city,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.160
bring them out of this place.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.520
Why? V. 13,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.000
for we will destroy this place.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.200
Because of the cry of them as wax and grape

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.600
before the face of the Lord,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.960
and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960
It's interesting to note what it says

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.120
in v. 16.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.760
He'd been warned that they were going to destroy it.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.560
And it says, while he lingered.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.320
While he lingered.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.600
Lot, what is wrong with you?

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600
I mean, he's lingering in this city

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.560
that the angels have said it's going to be destroyed

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.600
because of the wickedness.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.560
And he's been so influenced

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.400
by the morals or the immorals,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.120
the wickedness of this city

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.000
because he's pitched his tent toward it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.080
He's dwelt there.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.880
He's sitting in the gate of Sodom.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.440
And now we find that he lingers

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.320
in the very city that the angels said,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.280
get out of here because we're going to destroy it.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.200
Lot was a man that was fearful.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.080
He was fearful.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.680
It's kind of interesting to see.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.920
Look at v. 19.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.200
In v. 17, they say,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.440
escape for thy life.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.200
Look not behind thee.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.040
It tells them to escape to the mountain.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.960
And Lot said, not so, my lord.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.600
Behold now, look at v. 19,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.640
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.600
and thou hast magnified thy mercy

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.080
which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.880
And I cannot escape to the mountain

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.040
lest some evil take me and I die.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.640
He was afraid to go to the mountain,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.880
to go to the place where he was told to go.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.440
And so we find that he continues and says,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.880
behold now, this city is near to flee unto it

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.080
as a little one.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.360
Oh, let me escape thither.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.440
Is it not a little one?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.400
And my soul shall live.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.720
And he said unto him,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.920
see, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.120
that I will not overthrow this city

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.680
for the which thou hast spoken.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.840
But look down to v. 30.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.360
It says, and Lot went up out of Zoar,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.560
which is the city that he was speaking about.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.160
It says that he went up out of Zoar

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.120
and dwelt in the mountain

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.800
and his two daughters with him

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.880
for he feared to dwell in Zoar.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.840
And he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.160
Well, he was fearful to go to the mountain the first time.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.680
So he desired to go to Zoar.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.160
Then he's afraid to be in Zoar

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.400
and he goes to the mountain.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.960
He's a man that's living in fear.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.080
He has no peace.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.120
And perhaps it's because of what we find

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.560
in the New Testament when the Bible says

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.800
that he vexed his righteous soul.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.480
See, the reality is I've said often

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.040
that peace is not found in the absence of trouble,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.800
but in the presence of God.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.480
And when Lot is living in this wicked city,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.160
when Lot is being influenced by the wickedness

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.960
of this Sodom and Gomorrah and their immoral behavior,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.760
we find that Lot is in a place where he has no peace

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.000
and therefore he's living in fear.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.800
We find here how that the culture

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.640
influenced the thinking of Lot.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.320
Number two, I want you to consider

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.300
how the culture influenced Lot's family.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.400
How the culture influenced Lot's family.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.320
See, the reality this evening is that we remember

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.200
and we're aware of the fact that we have an enemy.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.920
I said last week as we studied

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.960
and really just focused on that first verse

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.400
and looked at the progression of Lot over the years

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.200
and how he eventually got to the place

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.000
where he was sitting in the gate of Sodom.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.280
And I mentioned this, how the enemy desires

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.440
to desensitize us to wickedness.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.900
He wants us to come to a place

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.200
where we just begin to accept wickedness

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.540
as being not only accepted, but being normal.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.380
It's allowed behavior, it's normal behavior,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.640
it's the right, and so on and so forth.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.160
And the enemy wants to cause us

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.120
to be desensitized to wickedness.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.520
We find that not only does he want to be successful

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.800
in desensitizing us to wickedness,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.320
but we find that he wants to desensitize your children

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.640
and your family to wickedness.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.200
The reality is that Lot is in a place

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.200
where he should not be.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.440
And unfortunately, his wife and his children

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.440
have been influenced by this culture.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.880
I think that it would be safe to say,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.559
as you look at the passage of Scripture,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.880
that though Lot is referred to in the New Testament

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.960
as being a righteous man,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.120
that most of his family did not follow the Lord Jehovah.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.720
The reality this evening is that

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.480
when you look at the passage of Scripture

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.720
and you see what happens and what unfolds,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.160
and you read how that he, Lot,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.000
is given from these angels the responsibility

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.960
of going and getting his family,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.160
we noticed already in v. 12

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.720
how that the men said unto Lot,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.640
hast thou here any besides?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.320
Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.160
and whatsoever thou hast in the city,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.480
bring them out of this place.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.680
The Bible tells us in v. 14,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.200
and Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.040
I believe this evening that as you look at the passage,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.720
that it would seem as if it was that very same night,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.120
it was that night that these angels came,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.720
and it was that night that Lot left his home

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.600
and he's going, and I don't know how far he had to travel

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.520
to get to the homes of his family members,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.440
but we find that he's going

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.240
and he's taking this information to them,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.920
and we find that Lot is giving them this.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.200
We find in v. 15 it says, and when the morning arose,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.200
and so we find that Lot spent some time that evening

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.360
going and giving a warning,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.320
but notice how his family had been influenced by the culture.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.600
It says in v. 14,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.480
that Lot went out and spake unto his sons-in-law,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.000
which married his daughters, and said,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.800
Up, get you out of this place,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.559
for the Lord will destroy this city.

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:33.240
But he, Lot, seemed as one that mocked

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.840
unto his sons-in-law.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.880
He had no influence over his children,

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.800
over his married daughters, his sons-in-law.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.200
He did not have an influence over them, why?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.600
Because they'd been influenced by the culture.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.680
You know, the reality is that the culture

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.160
wants to influence your children

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.360
more than you are influencing your children,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.920
and you gotta be careful.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.400
You should ask yourself the question this evening

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.800
as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.279
and really we'll get to it at the end of the message,

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:03.880
but how is the culture influencing me?

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.480
How is the culture influencing my loved ones, my family?

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.120
How is the culture that we're living in influencing us?

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.640
Is the culture having a greater impact and influence on us

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.240
than the Word of God is?

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.200
We come to a place where Lot goes to his sons-in-law,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.760
and we find that these married daughters

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.880
and these sons-in-laws,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.400
they look at him as one that mocked.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.480
They did not listen.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.559
They did not respond to the warning that he would issue.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.000
And the Bible says in v. 15,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.080
when the morning arose,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.160
then the angels hastened Lot, saying,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.080
Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.400
which are here,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.040
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.120
So we see the other family that is mentioned here

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.000
in v. 15, his wife and his two daughters.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.200
Those are the same daughters that in v. 8

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.080
he was willing to offer to the men of the city.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.400
Those are the two daughters that still lived in his home.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.279
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.120
about the way in which the culture influenced his family,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.760
not only in his married children,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.680
but if you notice, also in the influence upon his wife.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.800
We read a number of these verses already.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.680
Skip down, if you will, to v. 22.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.520
The Bible says,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.320
Haste thee, escape thither,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.160
for I cannot do anything till thou become thither.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.800
The sun was risen upon the earth

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.680
when Lot entered into Zoar.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.840
Then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah,

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:34.320
a brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.679
The Bible tells us that he had been given the instruction

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:41.200
in v. 17, escape for thy life, look not behind thee,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.840
neither stay thou in all the plain,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.640
escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.840
In v. 25, it says that he overthrew those cities

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.520
and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.720
and that which grew upon the ground, look at v. 26,

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.359
but his wife looked back from behind him

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:03.520
and she became a pillar of salt.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:08.359
Lot's wife had been influenced by the culture.

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.080
Why did she look back?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.280
She had lived there for a number of years

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.160
at this particular time.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.320
She had grown to operate within this culture

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.880
and within this society

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.520
and no doubt they had been influenced by the society

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.119
and she looks back and the Bible tells us

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:30.840
that she became a pillar of salt.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.559
I believe really that this is a reference for us

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:36.600
to understand that sometimes sin and wickedness

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.960
has immediate consequences.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.960
Sometimes when we're not careful,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.760
we don't see the immediate consequences of our wickedness

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.359
and we think that God's okay with it.

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:50.400
Here when Lot, when they're fleeing the city,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.160
when the Lord is destroying Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.359
Mrs. Lot turns back and she looks at the city

00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:59.359
and she turns into a pillar of salt.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:03.679
It's interesting to note that the Lord Jesus Christ said in Luke chapter 17,

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:07.519
remember Lot's wife.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.719
Isn't that interesting?

00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:11.839
Remember Lot's wife.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:13.279
She looked back.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:16.159
She became a pillar of salt.

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:20.159
I want you to consider with me the way in which the culture influenced his family,

00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:24.239
not only his sons-in-law and his married daughters, his wife,

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:27.679
but I want you to consider the way in which it influenced his

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:30.239
daughters that were not married.

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:34.159
The Bible continues to tell us about these things that are taking place

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:38.799
and how that Lot feared to dwell in Zoar, as I read already in verse number 30.

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:42.879
And so he went and dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.

00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:46.399
I will say this.

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:51.599
The two daughters of Lot were no longer in Sodom,

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:55.199
but Sodom was still in them.

00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:57.679
They were no longer in the city.

00:20:57.679 --> 00:21:01.999
They were no longer in Sodom, but Sodom was in them.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.199
Why? They got influenced by the culture.

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:10.079
I've mentioned before how the book of Exodus reveals to us the Exodus,

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:13.839
the way in which God delivered His people from Egyptian bondage.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:18.399
And when you read about the miracle of, many miracles in fact,

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:22.799
of all that God did to deliver His people out of Egyptian bondage,

00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:27.599
we find that that's a picture of God getting His people out of the world.

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:31.119
And then you come to the book of Leviticus and you read all of these

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:35.999
truths with regard to the sacrificial system and the offerings and

00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:39.439
all of these things that would take place and all that they were responsible for.

00:21:39.439 --> 00:21:42.799
And I truly believe that as you study through the book of Leviticus

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:47.599
that really what you find is that God is taking the world out of His people.

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:51.839
He's already taken His people out of Egypt,

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:55.999
but now in the book of Leviticus, He's taking Egypt out of His people.

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:59.279
And here we would find that these two daughters of Lot,

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:03.599
they no longer were in Sodom, but Sodom was in them.

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:09.839
And it says this in verse number 34, excuse me, verse number 31.

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:11.839
And I'm not going to make a lot of comment here.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:13.599
There's some younger children in the room.

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:15.039
I'm not going to make a ton of comment,

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:21.519
but I want you to understand the level of depravity.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:25.119
The incestuous relationship that took place

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:29.439
is beyond comprehension for this preacher.

00:22:29.439 --> 00:22:31.039
It says this,

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:33.199
The firstborn said unto the younger,

00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:36.319
Our father is old, and there's not a man in the earth

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:39.519
to come in unto us after the matter of all the earth.

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:42.959
Come, let us make our father drink wine,

00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:49.359
and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father.

00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:52.559
And they made their father drink wine that night.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:55.519
And the firstborn went in and lay with her father,

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:59.919
and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.959
And it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger,

00:23:02.959 --> 00:23:05.119
Behold, I lay yesterday night with my father.

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:08.719
Let us make him drink wine this night also,

00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:15.839
and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father.

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:18.799
And they made their father drink wine that night also.

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:20.639
And the younger arose and lay with him,

00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:25.279
and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose.

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:27.759
It says in verse number 36,

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:35.439
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:39.919
It's just wicked.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:44.799
If Lot's wife is a picture of immediate consequence,

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:52.159
I would say that the daughters of Lot is a picture of long-term consequence.

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:54.479
The Bible tells us in verse 37,

00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:57.839
And the firstborn bare a son and called his name Moab,

00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:00.799
the same as the father of the Moabites unto this day.

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:04.239
And the younger, she also bare a son and called his name Ben-Ammai,

00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:07.599
the same as the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:08.879
As you read your Bible,

00:24:08.879 --> 00:24:14.079
are you familiar with the terms the Moabites and the Ammonites?

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.519
You read about the Moabites,

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:16.799
and you read about the Ammonites,

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:20.000
and you read about the various battles and various ways

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.319
in which they were the enemies of God's people,

00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:24.719
and the reality is that it's a direct result

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:30.799
of the incestuous relationship that took place in Genesis 19.

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:34.079
It's a long-term consequence.

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:36.000
Wicked.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.199
Wicked.

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:40.399
Ungodly.

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:44.319
This evening, the culture of Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:50.399
the society, influenced Lot's thinking.

00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:56.319
The culture, the society, influenced Lot's family.

00:24:56.319 --> 00:25:01.199
This evening, I would ask this question in our final point.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:03.199
How does the record of Genesis 19,

00:25:03.199 --> 00:25:10.079
or how should the record of Genesis 19 influence believers today?

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:16.079
What warnings should we receive from a passage of Scripture such as this?

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:21.919
In 1980, John Phillips, he's with the Lord now,

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.639
he's a great pastor, man of God,

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:28.000
and he made some comments in some of his writings

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.199
about these cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:35.039
And as we begin to think about the ways

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:37.679
in which the text of Scripture should influence us

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.279
as the people of God today,

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:44.000
I thought it pertinent to read these two excerpts.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.399
John Phillips said this.

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:49.919
From now on, the spotlight swings from the filthiness of Sodom

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:52.319
to the situation that existed in Lot's own family.

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:54.239
I just dealt with that.

00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:55.279
But he says this.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:59.119
It shows what the philosophy of Sodom

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:02.559
had done to the thinking of a believing man.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:03.119
Notice this.

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.279
This is the application that he makes.

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:12.559
Truly, we cannot keep on imbibing the world's ideologies

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:17.439
without becoming tainted ourselves.

00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:19.839
1980 he said that.

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:22.000
How true.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.039
We cannot allow the ideologies,

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:26.799
imbibing in the world's ideologies

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.759
without becoming tainted ourselves.

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:30.479
He said this.

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:34.639
The unholy lust of those men were pugnacious,

00:26:34.719 --> 00:26:36.879
no longer did the perverts practice

00:26:36.879 --> 00:26:39.359
their abominations in secret,

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:41.839
ostracized by the rest of the community.

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.839
No longer were their shameful sins

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:46.799
tolerated by a permissive society

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:50.799
as something people had a right to practice if they pleased.

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.319
It had gone far beyond that.

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:56.879
Now the people were an open, aggressive,

00:26:56.879 --> 00:26:59.599
insistent force in the city

00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:01.839
with which none dared interfere.

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:05.679
For their behavior was not looked upon

00:27:05.679 --> 00:27:07.759
by the Sodomites as criminal,

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:10.000
but as constitutional.

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:11.119
Wow.

00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:13.279
2021.

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.559
This was written in 1980.

00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:18.239
He says of the people in Sodom

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:20.399
that they were not looking at these acts

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:21.759
as being criminal,

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:23.439
but as constitutional.

00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:27.679
They had the constitutional right

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.079
to indulge their passions

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:31.359
to indulge their passions

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.159
when and where they wished

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:36.000
and any attempt to thwart them

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.159
could be expected to lead to open riot in the city.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.279
41 years later,

00:27:44.639 --> 00:27:47.759
is it not more pertinent today than even then?

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:51.679
This is nothing new.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:54.639
It's in our face though.

00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:56.959
Amen?

00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:59.039
It is in our face.

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.359
Let me read three passages from the New Testament.

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:02.639
Luke 17.

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:04.479
These are the words of Jesus Christ

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:07.359
as He is ministering during His earthly ministry

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:08.639
and He's using here

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:11.439
some things with regard to the end times

00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:12.079
and what have you.

00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:13.919
He used the illustration of Noah.

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.439
And then He begins to use the illustration

00:28:15.439 --> 00:28:16.319
of the days of Lot.

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:18.399
Notice in v. 28 of Luke 17.

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:21.119
In Luke 17 and v. 28,

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:21.759
the Bible says,

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:24.479
likewise also as it was in the days of Lot,

00:28:24.479 --> 00:28:25.759
they did eat,

00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:26.479
they drank,

00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:27.119
they bought,

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:27.759
they sold,

00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:28.559
they planted,

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.439
they builded.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.640
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.760
it rained fire and brimstone from heaven

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.440
and destroyed them all.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.359
It's v. 32 where He mentioned earlier

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:40.159
where the Bible says,

00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:42.799
remember Lot's wife.

00:28:44.719 --> 00:28:46.239
I want you to notice what the Bible says

00:28:46.239 --> 00:28:47.760
in 2 Peter 2.

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.880
2 Peter 2.

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:55.440
In verses 6-9,

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:58.880
Peter dealing with the false teachers

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.559
and dealing with

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:02.479
not only the way in which they do business,

00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:04.159
but the way in which they'll be judged.

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:07.679
He uses the example of the angels

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.880
that sin in v. 4.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.159
He used the example of the flood in v. 5.

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:14.000
And then in v. 6-9,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.440
he used the example of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.200
The Bible says this in v. 6.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.000
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.359
into ashes condemned them with an overthrow.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:28.559
Making them an ensample unto those

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.799
that after should live ungodly.

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.519
So we see a reference to them being an example.

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.320
Notice v. 7.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.399
And delivered just Lot vexed

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.239
with the filthy conversation of the wicked

00:29:38.239 --> 00:29:41.279
for that righteous man dwelling among them

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.760
and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.279
from day to day with their unlawful deeds.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.359
Turn to the little book of Jude, if you will.

00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:52.320
The book of Jude, again,

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.000
the problem that Jude is addressing

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.440
in this very short book

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.279
is that of false teachers that had crept...

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:07.279
in unawares, that turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, literally unbridled lust.

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:14.039
And we find that they are being disgust in their actions, and then again, here Jude will

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:19.799
use the examples of those that had faced punishment, the judgment of God, and in verse number seven

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:24.399
he uses the example of Sodom and Gomorrah that we're studying here in Genesis 19.

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:28.239
The Bible says, "...even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner,

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:34.199
giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:38.639
an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal life."

00:30:38.639 --> 00:30:44.179
The wicked and immoral behavior of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah has been documented.

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:48.519
We understood as we started studying the life of Abraham, really going through here the

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:53.719
book of Genesis, that it was there in chapter number 13 that we first begin reading about

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:57.919
the wickedness of the people that dwelt in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:02.159
And we find that that wickedness has been documented, and eventually, as we're reading

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:07.799
here in Genesis 19, the wrath of God was unleashed and these cities were destroyed.

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:15.039
I would submit to you this evening that we too are living in a time in which the judgment

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:20.639
hand of God will be poured upon wickedness.

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:22.839
Our God is just.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:25.399
Our God is perfect.

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:26.399
He's holy.

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:27.399
He's long-suffering.

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:31.719
And I would say this this evening, we ought never mistake the long-suffering of God for

00:31:31.719 --> 00:31:33.599
His approval.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:35.699
God never approves wickedness.

00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:38.279
He never approves sinful behavior.

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:43.719
And at times we may be experiencing and we may be seeing the long-suffering of God, the

00:31:43.719 --> 00:31:48.359
way in which we would notice it here even in Genesis with regard to Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:53.079
and the way in which it was in chapter 13 that we're aware of the wickedness, there

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:59.079
were exceeding sinners, sinners exceedingly, that it's there that God's long-suffering,

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:03.399
it's not until chapter 19 in which they're destroyed, but we understand that God's long-suffering

00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:06.799
should never be mistaken with God's approval.

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:09.999
God is not okay with sin.

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:13.519
He's just not.

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:22.439
Today we find ourselves living in a culture, living in a society, that is not only allowing

00:32:22.439 --> 00:32:29.799
and approving, but celebrating wickedness.

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:35.639
They are celebrating the very wickedness that resulted in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:39.439
in our day, today.

00:32:39.439 --> 00:32:47.879
And it's a, as John Phillips said in 1980, it's a constitutional right.

00:32:47.879 --> 00:32:50.039
It's where we live.

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:52.599
It's where we live.

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:56.159
But how do we respond?

00:32:56.159 --> 00:33:00.719
How do we allow the record of Genesis 19 to influence us?

00:33:00.719 --> 00:33:07.679
See, because the reality is that we too as a nation are going to face judgment.

00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:11.199
Sin is a reproach to any people.

00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:16.639
There's nothing particularly special about the United States of America that just because

00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:20.159
we're Americans, we're not going to face judgment.

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.959
It doesn't work that way.

00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:26.219
God is no respecter of persons, amen?

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:34.039
And the reality is that we're living in a time in which not only is the wickedness allowed,

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:40.299
but it goes to another step altogether when it is celebrated.

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:45.679
It's a completely disdain in God's eyes.

00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:52.519
And it's a group of people, a culture that literally, figuratively, however you want

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:56.119
to look at it, it's as if they shake their fists at God and say, we're going to do what

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:57.119
we want to do.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:34:00.199
And that's where we live.

00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:04.159
So we're either going to be influenced by the culture that we're living in, and we're

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:11.999
going to say, well, you know, that's what the law says, and that's what's, or we're

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:18.599
going to allow an account such as Genesis 19 to influence us to say right is right and

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.519
wrong is wrong.

00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:23.239
Sin is sin.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.799
It doesn't mean that we don't love people.

00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:28.279
It doesn't mean that we don't want people to be saved.

00:34:28.279 --> 00:34:32.999
Listen, I am not in any way, shape, or form saying, oh, I wish God would rain down fire

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:35.199
and brimstone and destroy people.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.119
No, because I understand when people die, they're going to spend eternity in the lake

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:41.479
of fire if they're not saved.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:48.639
My heart breaks for people that are blinded by the God of this world.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.399
They need to be saved.

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:52.439
They need to be saved.

00:34:52.439 --> 00:35:00.559
They need to be lovingly given the truth of God's Word.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.319
God loves everybody.

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:03.679
God loves.

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:05.519
God is love.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:13.119
But God has stated in His Word what is right and what is wrong, correct?

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.839
He's made it clear.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:20.919
And it does not matter if in Judah, according to Isaiah, they're legislating wickedness,

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:26.239
or in the United States of America today that they legislate wickedness, God is the judge

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:29.439
of the earth.

00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:34.679
And so if the land, if the justice system in the land is corrupt, you can rest assured

00:35:34.839 --> 00:35:36.839
that God is not corrupt.

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:38.999
He's a righteous judge.

00:35:38.999 --> 00:35:40.879
Amen?

00:35:40.879 --> 00:35:45.759
It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God.

00:35:45.759 --> 00:35:47.799
I don't want to face the judgment of God.

00:35:47.799 --> 00:35:53.479
Listen, I believe that it's time for us, even as it was in the time of Nehemiah, that we

00:35:53.479 --> 00:35:57.159
begin to weep for our nation.

00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:00.999
Because I'm telling you, our nation is ripe for judgment.

00:36:00.999 --> 00:36:03.119
Sin is a reproach to any people.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:07.519
How could we be influenced by this particular passage of Scripture?

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:10.799
Number one, I would say this, we're to have no friendship with the world.

00:36:10.799 --> 00:36:15.719
Now understand, when I use the terminology world, I'm using it in the biblical sense

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:21.639
of the world's philosophy, the philosophy of the world.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.719
We're to have no friendship with the world.

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:28.079
I understand that we need to reach people with the gospel, and there are times in which

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:32.599
we need to befriend people and be a friend to people and show them the love of Christ.

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:38.679
And so I'm not suggesting it in that sense of the word, but I'm saying this, we have

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:41.079
to understand this world has a system.

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:45.879
There is a biblical worldview, and then there's a worldview.

00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:53.159
And the worldview is in direct opposition to God's biblical worldview.

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:54.519
And so we're to have no friendship with the world.

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:58.759
Notice in the book of James, if you will, James 4, we're familiar with the passage of

00:36:58.759 --> 00:37:13.719
Scripture, and James 4, in verse number 4, James 4, in verse number 4, the Word of God

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:20.159
says this, "'Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:23.639
is enmity with God?

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:28.799
Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.'"

00:37:28.799 --> 00:37:36.039
I don't want to be a friend of the world in the sense of this passage of Scripture.

00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:42.039
The reality this evening is that Lot paid a great price.

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:45.099
Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed, but, you know, he had married children that were destroyed

00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:46.679
in that city.

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:51.319
He had a wife that turned to a pillar of salt.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:56.519
He had two daughters that committed great wickedness.

00:37:56.519 --> 00:38:03.639
Do you think for a moment that when Lot pitched his tent towards Sodom, and when he said,

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:08.359
hey guys, we're moving into Sodom, there's a nice house over here for sale, and it began

00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:12.559
to get influenced, do you think that he considered that was going to be the end result, what

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:14.959
we studied tonight in Genesis 19?

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:18.599
If so, he'd be an absolute idiot to do what he did.

00:38:18.919 --> 00:38:22.719
It's not what he thought was going to happen.

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:25.159
And here's what happens in our lives today.

00:38:25.159 --> 00:38:28.119
We think, oh, it's not really going to affect me.

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:29.119
It's not going to affect my kids.

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:32.959
It's not going to affect, no, no, be careful.

00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:36.559
Friendship with the world is enmity with God.

00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:38.119
So what do we learn from Genesis 19?

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:42.119
How are we influenced by the text of Scripture before us here in Genesis 19?

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.199
Well, we're to have no friendship with the world.

00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:46.479
Let me say this, we're to have no love for the world.

00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:50.159
Again, in the sense of what we're dealing with, with the world system.

00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:52.999
Notice what the Bible says in Romans chapter number 12.

00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:59.879
The preacher this morning, he referenced this passage of Scripture when he dealt with sacrifice

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:03.719
and how important it is that we would present our bodies a living sacrifice unto the Lord

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:05.519
and how appropriate that is.

00:39:05.519 --> 00:39:09.319
But I want you to notice verses one and two together here in Romans chapter 12.

00:39:09.319 --> 00:39:12.759
Notice Paul says this, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you

00:39:12.759 --> 00:39:17.919
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable

00:39:17.919 --> 00:39:25.559
service and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your

00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:31.239
mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:34.599
We're not to be conformed to this world, but how are we going to avoid being conformed

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:35.599
to this world?

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:38.759
We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.

00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:40.159
How does that happen?

00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:42.919
By getting into this book.

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:46.519
I mean, it's just that simple, really.

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:48.919
There's nothing complicated about it.

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:54.999
It just means that you have to spend time in the Word and allow the Word to influence

00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:55.999
you.

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:59.039
So we're living in a world in which they're trying to, again...

00:39:59.039 --> 00:40:03.999
the celebration of wickedness, and the way in which they want to force everything upon

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:07.359
us.

00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:11.479
By the way, they're the people that say that they're tolerant.

00:40:11.479 --> 00:40:16.479
But the reality is that they're tolerant of anything and anyone that's not a Bible-believing

00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:17.479
Christian.

00:40:17.479 --> 00:40:19.559
That's just the bottom line.

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:21.799
And the reality this evening, that's what we're living in.

00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:24.719
That's what we're dealing with.

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:27.359
And so how do we operate in such a society?

00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:29.119
How do we operate in such a culture?

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:30.599
How do we not get influenced?

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:33.119
How do we prevent our kids from being influenced by that?

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:36.199
We must get into the book.

00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:40.679
And listen, I don't have to approve of your wickedness.

00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:44.799
I'm not suggesting that I'm going out and picketing and all of these crazy things that

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:50.759
some people go to an extreme, but I'm simply saying I do not have to compromise my biblical

00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:54.439
beliefs because of what you want to do.

00:40:54.439 --> 00:40:58.719
If you want to do it, by all means, you can do what you want.

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:00.359
We believe that, don't we?

00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:04.639
We believe in the sole liberty of individuals.

00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:08.239
You don't have to believe that Jesus is the only way, but one day you're going to stand

00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:12.559
before him and find out that he's the only way.

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:16.999
So why do I go and tell people about being saved because I understand the truth, but

00:41:16.999 --> 00:41:20.079
I don't force anybody to get saved?

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:28.719
Do they want to force us to follow their thinking and their morals or lack thereof?

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:31.119
No, we love not the world.

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.999
Notice this in 1 John 2, notice what the Word of God says.

00:41:34.999 --> 00:41:36.999
These are verses that we're familiar with.

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:40.439
These are verses that I've preached from before.

00:41:40.439 --> 00:41:52.179
In 1 John 2 and verse 15, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:55.599
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:58.999
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the

00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:02.319
pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world, and the world passeth away and

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:06.479
the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

00:42:06.479 --> 00:42:13.599
Let me ask you this, does Jesus love?

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:18.319
Did Jesus love when he was on this earth during his earthly ministry?

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:23.679
We sing, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so, right?

00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:27.839
I am so glad that my Father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given.

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:29.439
Wonderful things in the Bible I see.

00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:33.599
This is the dearest that Jesus loves me.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:37.199
Jesus loved during his earthly ministry, but you know what he did?

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:44.119
He stood before people and he caught them out for their wickedness, because he loved.

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:48.879
Not because of any other reason, and it doesn't suggest that Jesus didn't love because he

00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:53.439
said what their wicked sin was.

00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:58.119
Love is not permissive, that's the way that the culture wants to tell us it is.

00:42:58.119 --> 00:43:00.479
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:04.879
Listen, when we truly demonstrate love for someone, you know what it is, it's telling

00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:05.879
them the truth.

00:43:05.879 --> 00:43:10.079
It's telling them the truth.

00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:17.439
If you go to a doctor, Ronnie, can I use you as an example tonight, is that alright?

00:43:17.439 --> 00:43:22.239
I sat with Ronnie, he had to go to the doctor for an MRI earlier this year, and there was

00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:26.279
a possibility that Ronnie was going to have cancer.

00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:28.239
He didn't know.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:29.879
But you know what Ronnie desired?

00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:31.879
That the doctor would tell him the truth.

00:43:31.879 --> 00:43:32.879
Right?

00:43:32.879 --> 00:43:38.359
Doc, if I have cancer, tell me I have cancer, let's deal with it, let's get what we need

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:39.359
to get done.

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:44.959
Ronnie didn't desire to go to the doctor and the doctor say, oh, everything's fine,

00:43:44.959 --> 00:43:46.639
you're good.

00:43:46.639 --> 00:43:50.319
And the doctor knows that he's full of cancer and he sends him home and tells him he's fine.

00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:53.639
No, tell me the truth.

00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:55.219
Right?

00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:59.299
So the greatest way to demonstrate love is by telling somebody the truth.

00:43:59.299 --> 00:44:02.099
Listen, God loves you.

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:04.979
He's not okay with sin and wickedness.

00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:08.859
He doesn't accept ungodliness.

00:44:08.859 --> 00:44:10.699
He is the savior of the world.

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:14.659
He died for you because he loves you.

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:19.459
And this is the offer that he makes, he'll save you.

00:44:19.459 --> 00:44:21.499
They don't have to accept it.

00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:24.419
We never force anyone to accept it.

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:25.619
We just go on.

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:30.259
And if they accept it, man, glory to God, a sinner saved by grace.

00:44:30.259 --> 00:44:33.259
We now get to give them the truth of God's word and teach them all things whatsoever

00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:35.459
I have commanded you.

00:44:35.459 --> 00:44:36.819
Amen?

00:44:36.819 --> 00:44:40.539
But love tells the truth.

00:44:40.539 --> 00:44:45.499
Love doesn't put their arm around somebody and say, everything's going to be okay, everything's

00:44:45.499 --> 00:44:47.299
fine.

00:44:47.299 --> 00:44:50.939
Do you know that that's not the truth?

00:44:50.939 --> 00:44:53.979
Do you know that people are going to stand before God?

00:44:53.979 --> 00:44:56.459
Sure we do.

00:44:56.459 --> 00:45:00.859
Lot told his sons-in-law and his daughters, no doubt they were there, this city is going

00:45:00.859 --> 00:45:01.859
to be destroyed.

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:03.859
Was that truth?

00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:06.779
Could he force them to come?

00:45:06.779 --> 00:45:09.579
Were they destroyed?

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:12.019
Yes.

00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:14.619
We have no friendship with the world.

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:15.619
We have no love for the world.

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:22.339
I would say this, finally this evening, we're going to be unspotted from the world.

00:45:22.339 --> 00:45:23.339
Unspotted from the world.

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:32.059
Notice what James says, James chapter number one.

00:45:32.059 --> 00:45:39.939
You know that this world is trying to influence us, trying to spot us, amen?

00:45:39.939 --> 00:45:42.859
The world's trying to influence us.

00:45:42.859 --> 00:45:46.339
In James one and verse number 27, the Bible says, pure religion and undefiled before God

00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:51.059
and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:56.419
himself unspotted from the world.

00:45:56.419 --> 00:46:05.659
Notice how Paul says it to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians 5 and verse number 27.

00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:09.979
In fact, in verse 26, it's appropriate to read with it, in Ephesians 5 and verse 26,

00:46:09.979 --> 00:46:14.419
the Bible says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the

00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:21.699
word that he might present it, speaking of the church, to himself a glorious church,

00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:29.499
not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.

00:46:29.499 --> 00:46:35.859
We're to be unspotted from the world, not being tainted by the world.

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:39.539
And so how do we live in such a society?

00:46:39.539 --> 00:46:42.699
We're in the world, but we're not of the world, right?

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:46.359
That's what Jesus said in John 17 when he prayed.

00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:52.899
He said, keep them from the evil, sanctify them through thy word, thy word is truth.

00:46:52.899 --> 00:47:00.579
And so we can, in fact, it is our duty to live according to what Paul says in Philippians

00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:07.419
2 and verse number 15, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke

00:47:07.419 --> 00:47:16.499
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world.

00:47:16.499 --> 00:47:20.059
This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.

00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:23.299
We sing it with the kids.

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:29.259
The reality this evening is that we are living in such a time of living in the midst of a

00:47:29.259 --> 00:47:38.139
crooked and perverse nation, but we are to shine as lights in the world.

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:48.539
God uses us as His witnesses, and there's right and there's wrong.

00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:55.379
And this evening, when we look at the record of Genesis 19 and the destruction of Sodom

00:47:55.379 --> 00:48:02.459
and Gomorrah, when we begin to follow the text of Scripture, we understand tonight how

00:48:02.459 --> 00:48:07.899
the culture influenced the thinking of Lot.

00:48:07.899 --> 00:48:12.539
We understand how the culture influenced the family of Lot.

00:48:12.539 --> 00:48:17.939
But I just wonder tonight, are we as God's people today going to allow Genesis 19 and

00:48:17.939 --> 00:48:21.899
the record contained therein to influence us?

00:48:22.419 --> 00:48:29.419
Listen, we live in a wicked time, and the message that I'm preaching tonight is not

00:48:29.419 --> 00:48:31.459
very popular.

00:48:31.459 --> 00:48:34.219
Amen?

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:36.739
Second Timothy chapter number four, though, said preach the word.

00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:40.659
Be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and

00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:42.059
doctrine.

00:48:42.059 --> 00:48:45.820
The time is going to come when men will not endorse sound doctrine.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.339
We're there.

00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:49.139
They want you to tickle, it's their ears, right?

00:48:49.139 --> 00:48:50.139
Tickle their ears.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:55.219
In fact, you know, I was reading through the book of Isaiah, and they said of the prophets,

00:48:55.219 --> 00:48:57.259
we don't really want you to tell us the truth.

00:48:57.259 --> 00:49:00.820
Just tell us something that's going to make us feel good.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.579
We live in that type of a society.

00:49:04.579 --> 00:49:10.619
But tonight, our God is a righteous God.

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:19.659
And he said in his word, righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:49:20.179 --> 00:49:28.459
And we're living in a nation where we've not just allowed or approved, but we have

00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:33.940
started to celebrate wickedness.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.419
And I say to you this evening, I'm concerned for our nation.

00:49:38.419 --> 00:49:39.579
And I'm concerned for you.

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:45.099
I'm concerned for our families, that we're not influenced by this culture.

00:49:45.659 --> 00:49:51.779
We, as the people of God, are called to influence the culture.

00:49:51.779 --> 00:49:54.659
Not that the culture would influence us.

00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:59.019
One of the problems...

00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:06.339
in the church in Corinth, many problems, but one of the problems was that they were being

00:50:06.339 --> 00:50:13.259
more influenced by the city than they were influencing the city.

00:50:13.259 --> 00:50:19.459
There's a Greek term that was used during the time of the writing of 1 Corinthians and

00:50:19.459 --> 00:50:25.379
2 Corinthians and when Paul went to the city of Corinth, karynthosiam, and it was to act

00:50:25.379 --> 00:50:26.459
as a Corinthian.

00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:28.499
And here's what it meant.

00:50:28.499 --> 00:50:34.619
When you live immorally and ungodly, they would use that term to say you're acting and

00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:36.139
living like a Corinthian.

00:50:36.139 --> 00:50:38.739
That's how wicked it was.

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:43.139
But the church was being influenced by the society and God has always said that the church

00:50:43.139 --> 00:50:48.059
is supposed to influence the society, not the other way around.

00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:52.379
This evening, I hope that we would take heed to the truth of Genesis 19.

00:50:52.379 --> 00:50:54.219
We'd see the destruction.

00:50:54.219 --> 00:50:58.139
It's terrible.

00:50:58.139 --> 00:51:05.219
We'd see the way in which they're influenced and we would guard against it, evaluate it.

00:51:05.219 --> 00:51:07.659
How is this culture influencing me?

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:13.019
If you have children, how is this culture influencing my children?

00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:19.139
I would say this, and I'll say that I'm going to go out on a limb, but I'll say this.

00:51:19.139 --> 00:51:27.659
This culture is influencing your children more than you think it is, truly.

00:51:27.659 --> 00:51:31.219
This culture is influencing your children more than you think it is, and we're in a

00:51:31.219 --> 00:51:38.419
place this evening, we've got to live godly and righteously in this present world.

00:51:38.419 --> 00:51:40.699
We need to be lights.

00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:46.739
By the way, the darker the night, the brighter the light, amen?

00:51:46.739 --> 00:51:51.619
And we need to clean our lens so that that light shines forth.

00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:52.619
Let's pray.

00:51:52.619 --> 00:51:54.059
Father, we love You.

00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:56.899
We thank You for loving us.

00:51:56.899 --> 00:52:02.219
As we examine this passage of Scripture, I pray that we'd be honest in our evaluation,

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:07.499
that we would be influenced by the truth contained therein.

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:12.819
God that we'd understand the way in which Lot was influenced by the culture, the way

00:52:12.819 --> 00:52:17.099
in which his family was influenced, that we would guard against it.

00:52:17.099 --> 00:52:19.499
Lord, help us to have no friendship with the world.

00:52:19.499 --> 00:52:21.739
Help us not to love the world.

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:26.079
Help us to remain unspotted from this world.

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:37.459
Would You help us, God, to live the way that we're supposed to live, godly, righteously?

00:52:37.459 --> 00:52:43.939
Would You help us to shine as lights in this wicked and perverse generation, understanding

00:52:43.939 --> 00:52:50.379
that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not?

00:52:50.379 --> 00:52:55.259
You said this in that same passage, that if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that

00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:56.979
are lost.

00:52:56.979 --> 00:53:02.739
Would You help us tonight to recognize the greatest way that we can love an individual

00:53:02.739 --> 00:53:05.419
is by telling them the truth?

00:53:06.419 --> 00:53:08.419
I understand that it might not be pleasant.

00:53:08.419 --> 00:53:13.859
I understand that it might cost us something, even as the preacher preached this morning.

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:17.339
Would You help us to be willing to pay the price?

00:53:17.339 --> 00:53:20.299
Would You move and work as only You can in this time of invitation?

00:53:20.299 --> 00:53:21.779
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:21.779 --> 00:53:22.379
Would You stand with us?
