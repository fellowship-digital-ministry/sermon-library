1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
or Colossians chapter number four this morning.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,920
And we will finish up today,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,800
the study that we've had here on Sunday mornings

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,199
throughout 2021 from the book of Colossians.

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,359
And our theme, of course,

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,120
was found in Colossians two and verse number 10.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,079
And you're complete in him,

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,260
which is the head of all principality and power.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,319
And I'm thankful that we're complete in Christ, amen.

10
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,600
And what a blessing that is.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,360
We've learned many valuable lessons

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,799
from the book of Colossians.

13
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:31,559
And as we've studied through this book,

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,119
we have had the opportunity to learn these lessons,

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,000
to learn the importance of walking in the spirit

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,159
so that we fulfill not the flesh

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,380
and just the wonderful instruction that we've received.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,000
As we've looked over the last few weeks

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,599
at the fourth chapter of the book of Colossians,

20
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,560
especially the latter part,

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,759
we have seen that there are a number of individuals,

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,599
co-laborers and co-workers, fellow workers,

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,439
as Paul refers to them as in verse number 11,

24
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,919
that are mentioned by name

25
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:04,199
in this particular closing section.

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,839
This is common with many of the books of the Bible,

27
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:10,639
the epistles, when folks are mentioned by name.

28
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:13,879
At the end, of course, in our last study two weeks ago,

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,160
we looked at the zeal of Epaphras

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,519
in verses 12 through 13 this morning.

31
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,080
We're looking at verses 14 through 18.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,760
And you've already seen perhaps

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,120
in the back of the bulletin this morning

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,919
that the title for the message this morning

35
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,680
is Fulfill Your Ministry.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Fulfill your ministry.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,440
And as we look at this passage,

38
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,279
it begins in verse number 14.

39
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,080
And we again begin to read

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,739
of these several servants of the Lord.

41
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,580
The Bible says,

42
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,480
Luke, the beloved physician and Demas greet you.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,959
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea

44
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,440
and Nymphos and the church which is in his house.

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,239
And when this epistle is read among you,

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,160
cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,519
and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.

48
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,680
And say to Archippus,

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,440
take heed to the ministry which thou has received

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,180
in the Lord that thou fulfill it.

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,559
The salutation by the hand of me, Paul,

52
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:11,199
remember my bonds, grace be with you.

53
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,240
Amen.

54
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,360
We find first in verse number 14

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,639
that we're introduced to two of these particular individuals

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,600
that are mentioned by name.

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,559
First is Luke and both Luke and Demas

58
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,059
that are mentioned in verse number 14,

59
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,860
he says they send their greetings.

60
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,580
And so we find that Luke, of course,

61
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,940
is the beloved physician.

62
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,580
He is the one that has been used of the Lord

63
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,820
as the human penman to the book of Luke

64
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,020
and to the book of Acts.

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,699
And we find that he was a travel companion

66
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,699
of the apostle Paul.

67
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,000
You can read of that through the book of Acts

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,220
as you read and you find that he's a companion,

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,940
a travel companion of Paul.

70
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,460
We know that Demas here

71
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,979
in this particular text of scripture,

72
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,220
the Bible says and Demas greet you.

73
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,979
And so we find that he had faithfully served the Lord.

74
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,500
Unfortunately, in 2 Timothy chapter four,

75
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,660
in verse number 10, we read of this same Demas

76
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,580
that he forsook the Lord having loved this present world.

77
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,919
And we understand that the world is seeking to allure

78
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,300
the people from fulfilling their ministry.

79
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,020
And we see of Demas, even as he's mentioned here

80
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,940
in verse number 14, at this particular time

81
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,619
seems to be serving the Lord faithfully.

82
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,119
But according to the last letter

83
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,119
that Paul would be used to write 2 Timothy four,

84
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:27,279
he did leave loving this present world.

85
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,960
In verse number 15, we find that Paul

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,520
gives admonition instruction

87
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,660
to salute the believers in Laodicea.

88
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,039
Now you remember that Paul back in chapter number two,

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,479
if you turn back there quickly,

90
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,460
you'll find that in verse number one,

91
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,320
when he's speaking about the great conflict

92
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,919
that he has for the believers in Colossae,

93
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,759
that he also speaks about the believers in Laodicea.

94
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,320
He says in verse number one,

95
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,119
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you

96
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,600
and for them at Laodicea.

97
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,740
And for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,479
we find that the city of Colossae

99
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,960
and the city of Laodicea are separated by about 11 miles.

100
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
And so they weren't too terribly far

101
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,320
geographically one from another.

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,679
And we find that the same type of false teaching

103
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,839
that had infiltrated the church in Colossae

104
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,679
had infiltrated the church in Laodicea.

105
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,880
And so Paul instructs them not only to send his greetings

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,359
to salute the brethren,

107
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,200
but we find that in verse number 16,

108
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,720
he tells them that after they read this epistle,

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,079
the letter that we call Colossians,

110
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,519
that they're to send that letter

111
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,519
over to the believers in Laodicea

112
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,359
so that they too would be able to read this particular book.

113
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,679
And so we find that he gives extension

114
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,359
to these believers there in Laodicea.

115
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,000
We read of that same church

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
in Revelation chapter number three, of course,

117
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,839
a church that is not well commended by the Lord

118
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,440
because they were increased with goods

119
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,899
and had need of nothing.

120
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,040
They had a false perception of who they were.

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
In fact, it's of this church of the Laodiceans

122
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,119
that we read in Revelation three,

123
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,480
where the Lord Jesus Christ speaks about the fact

124
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,079
that he stands at the door and knocks.

125
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,679
And so often we use that passage of scripture

126
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,420
speaking about a lost person.

127
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,440
And I understand the application,

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,760
but the truth of that passage of scripture

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
is that the Lord Jesus Christ

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,720
is standing on the outside of his church.

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,480
He purchased it with his own blood,

132
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,760
and yet he's on the outside of the church

133
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,160
and he's knocking.

134
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,200
He says, if any man will let him enter,

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,519
he'll have fellowship with them.

136
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,399
He gives them instruction to repent.

137
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,640
And so we know some things about the church

138
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,059
of the Laodiceans.

139
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:44,399
We find also that Paul speaks about this one Nymphis.

140
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,220
We don't know a whole lot about him,

141
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,619
but he says that he has a church in his house.

142
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,660
And what a blessing to think about the faithfulness

143
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,980
of this individual and his service to the Lord

144
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,739
and his willingness to have brethren,

145
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,540
believers gather together.

146
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,220
There are still places around the world

147
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,100
where church houses, house churches,

148
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,940
are very common and very prevalent

149
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,600
because of some of the oppression

150
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,500
and some of the difficulties in which the brethren face

151
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,859
in various countries around the world.

152
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,899
And so of course we know it was very common

153
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,140
in the first century.

154
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,500
And this one, Nymphis, was in that particular situation.

155
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,720
We find that in verse number 17, he speaks of Archippus.

156
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,940
That will be the focus of our message this morning,

157
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,279
so I won't say much now by way of introduction.

158
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,380
But notice in verse number 18 that Paul says,

159
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,119
the salutation by the hand of me, Paul.

160
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,000
Now note, it's important that we see what he's saying here

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,459
and why he's mentioning this.

162
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,380
Many scholars believe and theologians

163
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,779
that Paul had a terrible situation with his eyesight

164
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,540
that probably was a result of the bright light

165
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,739
in Acts chapter number nine.

166
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:53,019
And we find that he had a problem with his eyesight

167
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:56,500
and therefore, though the Lord would use the apostle Paul

168
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,619
to write many of the books of the New Testament,

169
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,100
someone else, he would dictate that to them

170
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,940
and someone else would actually be the scribe, if you will.

171
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,019
But Paul would always write the salutation

172
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,140
with his own hand.

173
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,059
Notice what the Bible says over in 2 Thessalonians.

174
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,980
Hold your hand here in Colossians 4

175
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,700
and look in 2 Thessalonians 3.

176
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,179
I only mention this just to encourage us this morning

177
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,540
to understand the importance of why Paul

178
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,579
is making this statement in verse number 18.

179
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,420
Here to the believers in Thessalonica

180
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,220
now understand something by way of background

181
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,660
that he, Paul, ministered to these believers

182
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,540
in Thessalonica.

183
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,299
He had ministered there for a short period of time.

184
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:38,899
They were a faithful church.

185
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,220
But just like what happened in Colossian,

186
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,260
which continues to happen even still to this day,

187
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,820
there are false teachers that creep in.

188
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,540
And here in the city of Thessalonica,

189
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,540
what was happening is someone wrote a letter

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,700
and sent it to the believers to the church in Thessalonica

191
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,899
and said it was from Paul and caused great confusion

192
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,059
because many of the things that Paul had instructed them of

193
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,540
and had taught them, this particular letter

194
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,980
that was written, it was not appropriate.

195
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,980
It was very contradictory to what Paul had taught them.

196
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,980
And we find that as Paul is then writing to these believers

197
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,980
the second letter of 2 Thessalonians,

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,779
he says in verse number 17,

199
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,260
the salutation of Paul, notice what he says,

200
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,260
"'With mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle,

201
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,659
"'so I write.'"

202
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,900
That word token is defined as that

203
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,900
by which something is distinguished from others and known.

204
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,059
And so Paul is saying to the believers in Thessalonica,

205
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,739
I want you to know that the salutation is with mine own hand

206
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,219
and this is the authentication

207
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,280
to show that this is not a fraudulent letter,

208
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,039
this is authentic, this is from me,

209
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,520
this is the token of every letter

210
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,679
that he writes the salutation with his hand.

211
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,679
So when he says that to the believers in Colossae

212
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,559
in Colossians 4 in verse number 18,

213
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,640
the salutation by the hand of me, Paul,

214
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,359
again, that's the signature, the token,

215
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:22,239
the authentication of this particular epistle.

216
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,200
Notice what he says to them,

217
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
"'Remember my bonds.'"

218
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,239
We remember that Paul is writing the book of Colossians

219
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,719
from Roman prison.

220
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,719
We understand that he was awaiting his eventual death

221
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,760
and we find that God would use him to pen these words

222
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,880
to be an encouragement to this church in Colossae,

223
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,400
these believers that he had never met face-to-face,

224
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,840
but yet God would use him to be an encouragement to them.

225
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,679
And then he says this, "'Grace be with you, amen.'"

226
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,479
Wow, what a blessing to be mindful

227
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:00,479
in the very last statement of this book, the grace of God.

228
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,639
aren't you thankful for God's grace?

229
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,799
We sing amazing grace and I know for many

230
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,439
it's a favorite hymn and we think about God's amazing grace

231
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,479
and it's abundant and where would we be

232
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,839
without the grace of God, amen?

233
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,499
And we are saved by grace, we serve by grace

234
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,179
and we're so thankful for the grace of God

235
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,479
and we find that Paul mentions

236
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,499
in the very last part of this letter,

237
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,519
he reminds these believers of the grace of God.

238
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,239
Now the focus of our message this morning

239
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,359
is from verse number 17.

240
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,959
Notice again, the Bible says,

241
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,479
and say to Archippus, take heed to the ministry

242
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,979
which thou hast received in the Lord

243
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:41,119
that thou fulfill it.

244
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,799
Fulfill your ministry.

245
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,799
If you're taking notes, number one this morning,

246
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,119
a charge to Archippus.

247
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:51,339
We find that the Bible here in this text of Scripture,

248
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:53,599
Paul is mentioning a number of individuals.

249
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,359
He started in verse number seven with Tychicus

250
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,839
and he goes through and he names all of these individuals.

251
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,939
Some that are more familiar to us,

252
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,279
some that we know, some that we read

253
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,939
in other portions of Scripture

254
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,759
and can understand who they are

255
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,039
and the ministry that they have

256
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,919
and he mentions them by name

257
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,239
but he comes to verse number 17

258
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,719
and as he's writing, he says,

259
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,239
and say to Archippus.

260
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,759
You'd note the charge that is given directly

261
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,679
to the servant of the Lord.

262
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,799
In fact, the phrase reminds me of the instruction

263
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,439
that the angel gave on the morning of the resurrection.

264
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,679
You remember that it was Peter

265
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,759
that denied the Lord Jesus Christ on three occasions

266
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,359
and we find that after that,

267
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:37,759
he went out and wept bitterly

268
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,479
and we find that on the morning of the resurrection,

269
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:43,279
the angel, as they make the statement

270
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,559
to those that were there,

271
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,999
in Mark 16 verse number 17 says,

272
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,599
tell his disciples and Peter.

273
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,119
I like that.

274
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,279
And here, we find that Paul,

275
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,399
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

276
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,839
says and say to Archippus.

277
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,479
There is a charge that is being given

278
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:07,159
to this individual, this servant of the Lord.

279
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,359
Many believe that Archippus had been discouraged

280
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,799
as a result of the ministry

281
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,999
and possibly had even quit the ministry.

282
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,639
We read of this person, Archippus,

283
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,719
we read of him in Philemon too

284
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,359
and it appears from that portion of Scripture

285
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,519
in verse number two of the book of Philemon,

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,799
it appears that he was probably one of the pastors

287
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,599
and he had grown discouraged

288
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,359
and it seems as you would look at history

289
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,679
and those that have written of history

290
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,799
and these particular individuals

291
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,879
that it would seem that he had been discouraged

292
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,479
as a result of the ministry

293
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,119
and possibly had even quit.

294
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,999
Now, in light of that understanding,

295
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,839
in light of those circumstances,

296
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,159
we understand why God,

297
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,239
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,

298
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,839
would give Paul these words

299
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,959
and say to Archippus,

300
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,879
he's a discouraged servant of the Lord.

301
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,079
Listen, he's not the only one

302
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,039
that's ever been discouraged.

303
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,719
Amen?

304
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,639
We find that there's opposition,

305
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,279
there's adversity that we face

306
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,279
as servants of the Lord

307
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,239
and Archippus has faced this level of discouragement.

308
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,919
We don't know really the reason for the discouragement,

309
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,399
we don't know all that had taken place,

310
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,079
but when we understand the ministry

311
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,359
and we understand the things that you deal with,

312
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,199
you can understand and relate

313
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,079
and so we find the charge is this,

314
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,079
take heed.

315
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,759
And when you first read those two words,

316
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,599
you understand immediately

317
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,159
that there is a need to acknowledge something.

318
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,759
Take heed.

319
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,479
Take heed to what?

320
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,119
To the ministry.

321
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,159
Take heed to the ministry,

322
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,639
but notice how it is phrased,

323
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,479
which thou hast received in the Lord.

324
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,279
Now I like obviously every word of God is pure

325
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,559
and He uses the proper words

326
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,719
and helps us to understand the emphasis

327
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,999
that is being placed,

328
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,119
and we find that it does not simply say

329
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:12,079
take heed to the ministry,

330
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
though we would understand if that's where God left it,

331
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,519
but He says, take heed to the ministry

332
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,079
which thou hast received in the Lord.

333
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,279
Archippus had been entrusted.

334
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,359
He had been called by God.

335
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,479
He had been given this responsibility,

336
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,559
this ministry,

337
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,079
and we find that as we would understand this morning

338
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,839
that God calls and God enables

339
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
and He is reminding Archippus

340
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
through giving this particular charge,

341
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,999
this personal charge,

342
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,759
to take heed to the ministry

343
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,319
which thou hast received in the Lord.

344
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:53,719
Now not everyone's called to be a pastor.

345
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:56,519
Not everyone's called into full-time ministry,

346
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,399
but I would argue that every child of God

347
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,559
has been equipped to serve in some capacity.

348
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,919
We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

349
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,799
As every man hath received the gift,

350
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,199
even so let him minister

351
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,159
as of the ability which God giveth.

352
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,919
Why? So that in all things,

353
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,919
God would be glorified.

354
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,679
When you look at the church in Corinth,

355
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,519
there was all sorts of carnality

356
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,759
and division over the spiritual gifts.

357
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,359
But Paul reminds the believers in Corinth

358
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,599
that the purpose of the spiritual gift

359
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,799
is not to compete with one another

360
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,159
and to try to determine

361
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,359
who has a better spiritual gift,

362
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,999
for it's the Holy Spirit of God

363
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,919
who gives the gift as He will

364
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,119
for the profit of all

365
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,759
so that the church would be encouraged

366
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,959
and God would be glorified.

367
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,079
That's the purpose.

368
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,919
And so we find that though we look specifically

369
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,719
at this man Archippus this morning

370
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:04,159
and we notice what is being said here

371
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,959
that he has been called by God

372
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,399
to a particular ministry.

373
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,479
The devil doesn't want him to do it.

374
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,879
And the devil doesn't want you to do it.

375
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,599
Amen?

376
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,199
And so Paul, under the inspiration

377
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,839
of the Holy Spirit of God, says,

378
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,999
and say to Archippus,

379
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,719
take heed to the ministry

380
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,799
which thou hast received in the Lord.

381
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,359
I understand about volunteering

382
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,159
and I understand about Isaiah

383
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,719
when God said whom shall we send

384
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,839
and who will go for us?

385
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,319
And Isaiah says, here am I, Lord, send me.

386
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,639
But we understand this morning

387
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,039
that this is not something that we just volunteer in

388
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,319
and determine that okay,

389
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,879
this is going to be fun for a little while,

390
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,719
and then when it gets difficult,

391
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,119
say, you know what, I don't need to do this anymore.

392
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:56,039
No, we're called by God.

393
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,239
And we understand, see,

394
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:00,879
Paul is reminding, God is reminding Archippus

395
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,279
that you have received this ministry

396
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,959
in the Lord.

397
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,159
And if you've received it,

398
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,119
if God's called you, if you've received it,

399
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,599
guess what, you're responsible for it.

400
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,759
You're accountable.

401
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,959
And we find that Paul is giving this charge to Archippus

402
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
and notice how he ends the verse

403
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,839
in verse number 17,

404
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,719
that thou fulfill it.

405
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:29,239
Take heed to the ministry

406
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,839
which thou hast received in the Lord

407
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,559
that thou fulfill it.

408
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,439
The word fulfill carries with it

409
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,879
a number of ideas to carry through to the end,

410
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,719
to complete, to finish.

411
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:48,919
It also carries with it the idea of fill to be full.

412
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,839
And he says to Archippus

413
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,879
that he's to take heed to this ministry

414
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:56,399
which he has received in the Lord

415
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,839
that thou fulfill it.

416
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,359
Archippus, get back up.

417
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,279
Get back to doing what God has called you to do

418
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,959
and understand that God Almighty has called you

419
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:16,199
and God Almighty will sustain you.

420
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:19,279
Don't quit. Don't give up.

421
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,039
Fulfill it.

422
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,159
Fulfill what?

423
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,479
The ministry that you've received in the Lord.

424
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,319
Understand that Paul is the human penman

425
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,399
that God would use to write these words

426
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,320
and to give this charge to Archippus.

427
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,079
But understand that Paul understood

428
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,320
some things about opposition.

429
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,479
Turn to 1 Corinthians 16 if you will.

430
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,000
And notice what Paul says here

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,479
in this portion of Scripture.

432
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,559
We'll just look at two examples,

433
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
but I want you to see what Paul says

434
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,479
in 1 Corinthians 16 in verse 9.

435
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,639
Paul understood some things about adversity

436
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,119
when you read the book of Acts

437
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,239
and you read about the missionary journeys,

438
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,679
you find that every city

439
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,159
in that first missionary journey that he went to,

440
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,880
he was run out of town.

441
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,079
He was stoned and left for dead.

442
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,719
But he didn't quit.

443
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,479
Notice what it says in 1 Corinthians 16

444
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,279
in verse 9,

445
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,760
for a great door and effectual

446
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,639
is opened unto me,

447
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:24,799
and there are many adversaries.

448
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,440
I was reading the book of Amos this morning.

449
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,559
I was reading the book of Amos

450
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,440
and you'll find that even Amos faced opposition.

451
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,599
There were some that said of Amos,

452
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,039
go somewhere else and prophesy.

453
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,559
We don't want to hear that.

454
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,959
And we find here this morning

455
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,399
that Paul is trying to encourage

456
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,959
a brother, a servant of the Lord

457
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,279
that's been discouraged,

458
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,119
that's perhaps even quit the ministry.

459
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,320
And he says, listen,

460
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,719
I know some things about the difficulties

461
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,399
and the adversities and the trials

462
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,760
and the troubles that we face,

463
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,959
but Archippus, you need to take heed

464
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,000
of the ministry which you've received in the Lord

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,479
that thou fulfill it.

466
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:11,119
Notice in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, many times we think about this passage and we look at

467
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,759
the truth of my grace is sufficient for thee and what wonderful truth that is, but I want

468
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,879
you to notice a little bit past those verses of scripture, notice what is said in verse

469
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,639
number 14.

470
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,359
Paul is of course seeking to minister to these believers in Corinth, it says, behold, the

471
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,039
third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek

472
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,279
not yours, but you.

473
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,959
For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

474
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:41,839
And notice what he says in verse number 15, Paul is saying this to these believers, and

475
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:48,959
I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly I love you,

476
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:52,079
the less I be loved.

477
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,719
Paul wasn't in it to get the love back from the believers, he understood that God had

478
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,959
called him.

479
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:03,039
If you look at the letters that God used the apostle Paul to write, and we don't have time

480
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,599
this morning to look through them, but if you go to the first chapter and the first

481
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,439
few verses of each of the first chapters, you'll find that in many of them that Paul

482
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:17,919
acknowledges the call that God placed upon his life, the ministry that God had given

483
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,279
Paul that he had been entrusted with.

484
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,079
And so Paul is seeking to fulfill that ministry, and here in Colossians 4, he is seeking to

485
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:34,759
give this charge to Archippus, and say to Archippus, you've been given a ministry,

486
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:42,079
finish it, fulfill your ministry, you can't be on the sidelines, don't quit, I know there's

487
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,599
opposition, I know there's difficulty, I don't think that Paul knew all of the circumstances

488
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,319
and all of the things that he was dealing with, but God did, amen?

489
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,519
And as God knew what it was that Archippus was dealing with, God gave the charge to Archippus

490
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,239
to fulfill it, to finish the ministry.

491
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,739
So we see, number one, a charge to Archippus.

492
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,799
Number two, this morning notice a cloud of witnesses.

493
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,839
These are words that we find in Hebrews chapter number 12, of course we know that it's in

494
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:20,519
Hebrews 11, where we read of the great hall of faith chapter, and we read of all of those

495
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,959
Old Testament heroes of the faith, as we refer to them as, but we find that in chapter 12

496
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,959
of the book of Hebrews, in verse number 1, it says,

497
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:38,479
Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about, with so great a cloud of witnesses.

498
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:42,719
This morning I do not believe that the number of servants of the Lord that have fulfilled

499
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:45,879
their ministry is known to any of us.

500
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:50,719
For there are many servants of the Lord that we do not know.

501
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:55,279
That there are no history books written on them, there are no biographies or autobiographies

502
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,159
that you can go and look up and read of these heroes of the faith, they're unnamed servants

503
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,159
of the Lord.

504
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,099
But they're servants of the Lord nonetheless.

505
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:07,819
And they finished their ministry, though they may have been in some obscure place, though

506
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:14,139
they may not have had the level of prominence of others that we know so well, that we've

507
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:18,379
read their books and we've understood the ministries that they've had, they finished

508
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,539
their course.

509
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:25,219
And we have this great cloud of witnesses, it's interesting, even as you would look at

510
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:31,939
Hebrews 11, and there are many that are listed by name, and we see that as God would list

511
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:36,419
them by name, He then speaks of the fact that the time would not give them to speak of all

512
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,059
these others, but the reality is that we could add a whole lot of folks to the list

513
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,779
that we know.

514
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:48,859
But the number of servants that have fulfilled their ministry is really unknown to us.

515
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:54,559
This morning we have biblical record, in fact we have historical record, that would help

516
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,439
us to understand that there are many that have fulfilled their course, that have fulfilled

517
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,099
their ministry.

518
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,939
I want to give you just a few examples from the New Testament here this morning.

519
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:08,739
In Acts chapter number 12, in verse number 25, go over to the book of Acts, we'll look

520
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,699
at a few verses of Scripture in the book of Acts, and just give you a few examples this

521
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:15,899
morning of this cloud of witnesses.

522
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:21,659
In Acts chapter number 12, in verse number 25, the Bible says this, in verse 24,

523
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:28,979
But the word of God grew and multiplied, and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem,

524
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,299
Notice this phrase in verse number 25,

525
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:39,099
When they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.

526
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,099
What did they do?

527
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,259
They fulfilled their ministry.

528
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:46,019
It says that, and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their

529
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,019
ministry.

530
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:52,099
And what a blessing to understand, if you look back in chapter number 11, and really

531
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:56,179
beginning in verse number 22, all the way through the end of the passage of Scripture,

532
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,059
you'll have the understanding of what that ministry was.

533
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,659
It says in verse 22 of Acts 11,

534
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,019
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem,

535
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,899
and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.

536
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:11,899
And it says,

537
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:16,259
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that

538
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,219
with purpose and heart they would cleave unto the Lord.

539
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:22,659
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith, and much people was added

540
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:24,019
unto the Lord.

541
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,579
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus.

542
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:26,579
Why?

543
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,819
For to seek Saul.

544
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:32,739
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch, and it came to pass that a whole

545
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:38,099
year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people, and the disciples

546
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,059
were called Christians first in Antioch.

547
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:47,379
And they're serving God, and they're ministering in this young church that we read of in chapter

548
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,219
number 13 that becomes the sending church for the first missionary team.

549
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:57,379
Saul, of course we know Paul, Paul and Barnabas are there, and they fulfilled their ministry.

550
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:02,619
They were given a responsibility at the end of the text of Scripture to provide relief

551
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:05,899
for the brethren that dwelt in Judea.

552
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:10,059
And it tells us in verse 30, which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands

553
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,059
of Barnabas and Saul.

554
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,579
They had been given a task, and they fulfilled their ministry in teaching in Antioch, and

555
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:19,419
then they took that offering that had been brought up for the believers in Judea, and

556
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:20,419
they took it.

557
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,739
They fulfilled their ministry in Acts 12, in verse 25.

558
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:27,779
Notice in Acts 13, in verse number 25.

559
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:34,019
Just a page or two over, the Bible says, and as John fulfilled his course, he said, whom

560
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,099
think ye that I am?

561
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,779
I am not he, but behold, there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet I am not

562
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,539
worthy to lose.

563
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,179
Who is he speaking of?

564
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,179
John the Baptist.

565
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,179
Right?

566
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,179
John the Baptist.

567
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,779
You read in the Gospel of John, and you read about John the Baptist.

568
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:56,139
It was in the third chapter, that great declaration when he says, I must decrease, but he must

569
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:58,019
increase.

570
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,219
But John had been given an assignment.

571
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,059
He was the forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ.

572
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:10,459
He was the one that said, behold, the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.

573
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:19,099
And John the Baptist, it says here in Acts 13, that as John fulfilled his course, he

574
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,899
ran his race.

575
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:21,899
He finished.

576
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:23,179
He fulfilled his ministry.

577
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,379
In Acts 14, in verse number 26, notice this is the end of the first missionary journey.

578
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:34,539
I've often referred to this passage of Scripture at the end of Acts 14 as the first missions

579
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,299
conference when the missionaries come back and they report of all that God has done and

580
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,779
how God has worked.

581
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:45,939
But you'll see in verse number 26 that the Bible says this, and then sailed to Antioch

582
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:53,899
from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

583
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:58,899
You know that when Paul is used by God to write the book of Galatians, that that book

584
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:05,259
is not written to a single church of Galatia, it is written to the churches in Galatia that

585
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:09,939
are the churches that were established during the first missionary journey.

586
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,939
They fulfilled their work.

587
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,019
They fulfilled what God had called them to do.

588
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,779
If you were to take the time to go back to Acts 13 in the first few verses, you see how

589
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,979
that God called them and said, separate me, Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto

590
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:26,739
I have called them.

591
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,179
Does that not sound familiar to the charge that Archippus had received?

592
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:37,339
Listen, take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

593
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:43,579
We find this example that is given to us, of course, we're familiar with Paul in 2 Timothy 4.

594
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:47,619
We won't take the time to turn there this morning, but in 2 Timothy, it's the last letter

595
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:50,619
that Paul would write before he would face a martyr's death.

596
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:57,380
And we find that it was there that he says, I have finished, I have finished, I have finished.

597
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,699
What a blessing.

598
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,699
He'd kept the faith.

599
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,979
He had finished his course.

600
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:07,859
And Paul was confident of what God had called him to do, and he was faithful to fulfill

601
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,940
what he had been called to do.

602
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,019
So we look at these examples, and the time would not permit us to discuss many others

603
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,699
that would be noteworthy and important for us to focus on.

604
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:23,539
I want us to think this morning of this cloud of witnesses, and I want you to think about

605
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:27,979
our greatest example, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ.

606
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:33,339
Peter says this as he's writing to those believers that were facing great difficulty, that Christ

607
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,459
left us an example that we should follow His steps.

608
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:41,659
He is the Son of God, He's my Savior, but He's a great example.

609
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:45,979
We find that in John chapter number 17, notice what the Bible tells us.

610
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:52,139
We know that this actually is, in John 17, the prayer of Jesus.

611
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,579
And we find that oftentimes, the people will speak about the Lord's prayer, and they'll

612
00:29:55,579 --> 00:30:00,579
talk about the model prayer, or the instructive prayer, when Jesus says, when you pray, you

613
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:00,579


614
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,699
Here's how you pray.

615
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,079
That's not the Lord's Prayer.

616
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,279
John 17 is the Lord's Prayer

617
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,539
as it's recorded for us.

618
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,539
And I want you to notice what Jesus says

619
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,619
in John 17 in v. 4.

620
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:11,239
He says,

621
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:14,579
I have glorified Thee on the earth.

622
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,119
It begins in v. 1.

623
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,579
Father, the hour has come.

624
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:23,579
Glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.

625
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,699
What hour is He speaking of?

626
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,579
The time of His death.

627
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:29,079
The time of His death.

628
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,079
We sing oftentimes at Christmastime

629
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,079
this season that we're in the midst of

630
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,079
born to die.

631
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,579
He was born to die.

632
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:42,079
Why? Because that's how men would be redeemed.

633
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,079
We find here that Jesus says in v. 4,

634
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,079
I have glorified Thee on the earth.

635
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,079
And that's great.

636
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,579
That's what He has to do.

637
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:50,579
But then notice this,

638
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,079
I have finished the work

639
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,079
which Thou gavest Me to do.

640
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,579
What is that work?

641
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:01,579
The cross.

642
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,579
The substitutionary atonement

643
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,579
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

644
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:06,579
Now you'll note,

645
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:09,579
if you were to look at the passage of Scripture

646
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:11,579
and understand the chronological events

647
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,579
of the passage,

648
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:17,579
Jesus had not yet died.

649
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,579
In the Greek language,

650
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,579
you could use a terminology like He uses here

651
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,579
when He says I have finished the work

652
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,579
which Thou hast given Me to do,

653
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,579
that you could use something

654
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,579
that is so absolutely certain to happen

655
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,579
even before it took place,

656
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,579
you could speak of it as already being done.

657
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,579
And of course, Jesus being eternal,

658
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,579
He knew that He was going to finish this work

659
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:44,579
and He says I have finished the work.

660
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:45,579
I have finished.

661
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:48,579
Aren't you thankful that He finished?

662
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,579
He didn't just live a sinless life

663
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,579
and just heal a bunch of people

664
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,579
and perform miracles

665
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,579
and then just say,

666
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,579
well, I'm not going to do that part.

667
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,579
No, if you look back in Hebrews 12

668
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,579
for the joy that was set before Him

669
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:01,579
He endured the cross,

670
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:02,579
despising the shame.

671
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:03,579
Why?

672
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,579
Because He understood that was the purpose.

673
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:10,579
It was for Me that He died on that cross.

674
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,579
We find that it's in John 19

675
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:14,579
in verse 30

676
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,579
that Jesus lifts up His head

677
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:18,579
and as it says,

678
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:23,579
it is finished.

679
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,579
And He bowed His head

680
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,579
and gave up the ghost.

681
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,579
We've been told in John 10

682
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:30,579
that He's the Good Shepherd

683
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,579
and that the Good Shepherd

684
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:35,579
lays down His life for the sheep.

685
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,579
And Jesus did just that.

686
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:39,579
And just before He bowed His head

687
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:40,579
and gave up the ghost,

688
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:41,579
He said,

689
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,579
it is finished.

690
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:46,579
This morning,

691
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,579
we have great examples.

692
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,579
There's a cloud of witnesses.

693
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:53,579
Archipus is receiving this charge,

694
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,579
but we make application for us this morning.

695
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:56,579
We see it.

696
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,579
There's a cloud of witnesses.

697
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:58,579
There are many people

698
00:32:58,579 --> 00:32:59,579
that we could look to

699
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:00,579
and we could say,

700
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,579
they finished their course.

701
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,579
They fulfilled their ministry.

702
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,579
They did what God called them to do.

703
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:05,579
But I want you to understand

704
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,579
that in Hebrews 12,

705
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,579
when we read that phraseology

706
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,579
about a cloud of witnesses,

707
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:12,579
that really the focus

708
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:14,579
of that passage of Scripture

709
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,579
is on us.

710
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,579
Notice it in Hebrews 12

711
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,579
in verse number 1.

712
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:23,579
We read about that cloud of witnesses,

713
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:24,579
but really the focus

714
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,579
is upon the believers

715
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,579
that are still living.

716
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,579
We find that He says this

717
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,579
in Hebrews 12 in verse number 1.

718
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,579
Wherefore, seeing also

719
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,579
we also are encompassed about

720
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,579
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

721
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:38,579
notice,

722
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,579
let us,

723
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,579
let us lay aside every weight

724
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:46,579
and the sin which doth so easily beset us

725
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,579
and let us run with patience

726
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:55,579
the race that is set before us.

727
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,579
Four times the word us is used

728
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,579
in verse number 1 of Hebrews 12.

729
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,579
Because the emphasis is,

730
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,579
yes, there's a great cloud of witnesses,

731
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,579
but we have to run our race.

732
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,579
I would submit to you this morning

733
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,579
that by way of application,

734
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:15,579
we will look at this verse in Hebrews 12

735
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:16,579
in verse number 1

736
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:17,579
and speak of the race

737
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:18,579
that is set before us

738
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:21,579
as our ministry.

739
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,579
The race.

740
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:24,579
And the reality is that

741
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,579
as we look at this passage of Scripture

742
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,579
we see, yes,

743
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:28,579
there's a cloud of witnesses.

744
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:29,579
Yes, Archippus,

745
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,579
there are many others

746
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:31,579
that have fulfilled their ministry,

747
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,579
but the charge is to Archippus

748
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,579
to take heed to the ministry.

749
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,579
You've been discouraged

750
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,579
and you've dealt with

751
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,579
whatever opposition you've dealt with,

752
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,579
but you need to take heed

753
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,579
to the ministry

754
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,579
which thou hast received in the Lord

755
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,579
that thou fulfill it.

756
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,579
There's a cloud of witnesses.

757
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,579
Finally this morning,

758
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,579
there's a challenge for each of us.

759
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,579
Contextually in Colossians 4

760
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,579
as we close out the book,

761
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,579
we find that the Lord is speaking to Archippus.

762
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,579
But by way of application,

763
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:00,579
I believe this morning

764
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:01,579
that this charge can be applied

765
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:04,579
in each of our lives.

766
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,579
That thou fulfill it.

767
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,579
You say, how is it

768
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,579
that I can fulfill the ministry

769
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,579
that I've been given of the Lord?

770
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,579
See, understand this morning

771
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,579
that there are many adversaries.

772
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:18,579
Understand this morning

773
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,579
that we have an enemy.

774
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,579
And the enemy wants to destroy us.

775
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,579
He wants to devour us.

776
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,579
The enemy would like to do nothing more

777
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,579
but to derail us

778
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:29,579
and to distract us,

779
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,579
to cause us to be discouraged

780
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,579
so that we quit.

781
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:34,579
No doubt there are people

782
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,579
that we know that along the way

783
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:39,579
have quit serving God.

784
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,579
It's tragic.

785
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:43,579
It happens.

786
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,579
Demas hath forsaken me

787
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:48,579
having loved this present world.

788
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,579
The name Demas is written

789
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,579
just a few verses before Archippus.

790
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,579
And in 2 Timothy,

791
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,579
we read of him forsaking

792
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,579
because of loving this present world.

793
00:35:58,579 --> 00:35:59,579
And we find this morning

794
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,579
that there's a challenge for us.

795
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,579
Listen, this morning the enemy

796
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,579
wants to derail you.

797
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,579
He wants to discourage you.

798
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,579
He wants to cause you to say,

799
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:08,579
You know what?

800
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:09,579
It's just not worth it.

801
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,579
There are other things

802
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,579
that I could do.

803
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,579
But if we're going to fulfill our ministry

804
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,579
as we've used as our title this morning,

805
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:18,579
if Archippus is going to fulfill

806
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,579
the ministry that God has given him,

807
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,579
if you and if I are going

808
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,579
to fulfill the ministry,

809
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,579
I do not believe this morning

810
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:26,579
that it's going to happen

811
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,579
by chance or by accident.

812
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:30,579
I'm convinced of that this morning.

813
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,579
We're not just going to skate through life

814
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:33,579
and just come to the place

815
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:34,579
where we say like Paul said,

816
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:36,579
I have fought a good fight.

817
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,579
I have finished my course.

818
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,579
It's not going to happen by accident.

819
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:43,579
We better plan and we better purpose

820
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,579
to fulfill our ministry.

821
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,579
Let me give you four practical ways

822
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,579
this morning that as we close out

823
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,579
the book of Colossians,

824
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,579
that as we look at the charge

825
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,579
from Archippus that we could

826
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,579
also fulfill our ministry.

827
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,579
Look in Acts 20 and verse 24

828
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:03,579
and then we'll give you the four thoughts

829
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:04,579
this morning on how it is

830
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:05,579
that we can fulfill our ministry.

831
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,579
I mentioned that it's not going to happen

832
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:09,579
by accident.

833
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:12,579
It's not going to happen by chance.

834
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:15,579
Paul in 2 Timothy 4 gives us

835
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,579
that great declaration of finishing,

836
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,579
but in Acts 20 before he arrives

837
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,579
in Jerusalem when he stops and speaks

838
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:24,579
to the leaders of the church at Ephesus,

839
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,579
notice what Paul says in Acts 20

840
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,579
in verse 24,

841
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,579
but none of these things move me.

842
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,579
Neither count I my life dear unto myself,

843
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,579
notice what he says,

844
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,579
so that I might finish my course

845
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,579
with joy.

846
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,579
And the ministry which I have received

847
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,579
of the Lord Jesus to testify

848
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,579
the gospel of the grace of God.

849
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,579
Isn't that so familiar to what we've read

850
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:57,579
at the end of Colossians in the 17th verse

851
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,579
of chapter 4?

852
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,579
The ministry that you've received,

853
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,579
take heed of the ministry which you've received

854
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,579
in the Lord that thou fulfill it.

855
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,579
Paul says, so that I might finish my course

856
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,579
with joy and the ministry which I have received

857
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,579
of the Lord Jesus.

858
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,579
Many things can move us,

859
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:17,579
but Paul says none of these things,

860
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,579
none of these things move me.

861
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,579
Neither count I my life dear unto myself.

862
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:23,579
You know why?

863
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,579
Because Paul said I am crucified with Christ.

864
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,579
I'm crucified with Christ.

865
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:32,579
Four practical thoughts this morning.

866
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,579
How can we fulfill our ministry?

867
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,579
Well, number one, know your ministry.

868
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:38,579
Know it.

869
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,579
I would say this morning

870
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,579
that you're not going to finish your course

871
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,579
if you don't know your course.

872
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:46,579
Right?

873
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:48,579
Don't try to run somebody else's race.

874
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,579
Run your race.

875
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,579
Amen?

876
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,579
That's what you're responsible for.

877
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,579
You're not responsible for my race.

878
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,579
I'm not responsible for your race.

879
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,579
We're accountable and responsible to God

880
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,579
for the ministry that He has given us personally.

881
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,579
And then corporately as we serve God together,

882
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,579
we give account for that,

883
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,579
but the reality is that we need to know our place.

884
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,579
We need to know our course.

885
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,579
Know our ministry.

886
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:16,579
We're not going to fulfill it

887
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,579
if we don't know what it is.

888
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,579
I'm so thankful that Paul, he understood.

889
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,579
I mentioned already that when you read

890
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:23,579
many of the epistles,

891
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,579
that you find that Paul mentions

892
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,579
about the receiving of the ministry

893
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,579
and how God had called him.

894
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:30,579
In fact, don't turn there,

895
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,579
but in Galatians 1,

896
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,579
I want you to see that Paul says this,

897
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,579
I neither received it,

898
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,579
speaking of the gospel of man,

899
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,579
neither was I taught it,

900
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,579
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ

901
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,579
in Galatians 1 and verse 12.

902
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:48,579
So when we know what God's will is,

903
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:50,579
when we know what God's plan is

904
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,579
and what our ministry and our course is,

905
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:54,579
that's going to go a long way to us

906
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,579
running and finishing and fulfilling our ministry.

907
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,579
Because if I don't know what it is,

908
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,099
ever gonna know if I finished it? I know that's on the very low shelf, amen? But

909
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:10,359
it's super practical. I got to know it or I'm not gonna do it. I show up to the

910
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:14,419
wrong racetrack. You had a track meet yesterday, a basketball game yesterday.

911
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:22,439
You show up to the wrong court. You don't play the game, right? You don't run the

912
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:25,979
race. You're at the wrong track. It's like, man, no one else showed up. Yeah, you're at

913
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:32,519
the wrong place. Know your race. Know your course. Know your ministry. Super

914
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:38,159
practical. Notice what John 21 tells us. The Lord Jesus Christ in this passage of

915
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:45,599
Scripture is speaking to Peter. He's speaking to Peter. Peter had said this,

916
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:53,439
I go a-fishing. I go a-fishing in John 21 and verse number 3. The other disciples

917
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:59,139
went with him. They caught nothing. And Jesus met him on the shore. John says, I

918
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:02,679
think it's Jesus. And Peter swam and he just got off the boat and swam to shore,

919
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:08,259
right? And then Jesus, after he's talking, he says, Peter, do you love me? Peter, do

920
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:14,539
you love me? Peter, do you love me? And I want you to notice what John 21 in verse

921
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:20,339
number 21 says. Peter seeing him, this him is speaking of John according to

922
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:28,199
verse number 20, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Now Jesus had

923
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,719
already told Peter in verse number 19, follow me. And then Peter sees John and

924
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,359
says, well, what about him? You know what Jesus' answer is in verse number 22? If I

925
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:47,159
will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. You know, I

926
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:53,179
think Jesus is telling Peter in our own language today, don't worry about John.

927
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:58,139
Because John's gonna do what John's ministry is and what my, but Peter, I told

928
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:03,379
you, follow me. But so often we're, well, what about that person? What about this

929
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:07,539
person? And we get distracted by those things and we worry about what other

930
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:10,739
people are supposed to be doing. And at that time, guess what we're not doing?

931
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:19,159
We're not fulfilling our ministry, right? And so Jesus says, if I will that he

932
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,319
tarry till I come, what is that to thee? And then they all thought John's gonna

933
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,319
live until Jesus comes back. That's not what, that's not what Jesus said. What he's

934
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:33,719
saying is that don't worry about other people. Focus on what I told you, Peter,

935
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:41,339
follow me. Peter, follow me. Number two, number one was know your ministry. Number

936
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:46,899
two, keep your eyes on Jesus. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Can I tell you this

937
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:54,899
morning, people will fail you. People will hurt you. What did Paul say? The more I

938
00:42:54,899 --> 00:43:01,859
love, the less I be loved. People will hurt you. The people that you care about

939
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:09,359
and minister to the most will hurt you the deepest. But when we have our eyes on

940
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:18,079
Jesus, he will never disappoint you. Never will Jesus disappoint you. Man will

941
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,039
disappoint you, but Jesus will never. Aren't you thankful for that? You know

942
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,199
what he said in Hebrews 12 in verse 1? We've referenced it a couple of times

943
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:33,779
already, but in verse number 2, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of

944
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:40,419
our faith, we read at the end of verse number 1, let us run with patience the

945
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:44,379
race that is set before us. Well then, how do I run this race? How do I finish this

946
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:54,579
course? Looking unto Jesus. Archippus, get your eyes on Jesus. Did he not have

947
00:43:54,579 --> 00:44:01,439
adversity? Absolutely. But he finished his course. Archippus, for us this morning,

948
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:10,039
keep our eyes on the Lord. Number three, remain humble. Pride destroys. People will

949
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,719
disappoint, but pride destroys. In Acts chapter number 20, we won't turn back

950
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,799
there, but in Acts chapter number 20, Paul said in verse number 24, none of these

951
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:23,999
things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I may finish my

952
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:27,659
course with joy. But in verse number 19, he says, serving the Lord with all

953
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:35,819
humility of mind. We need to be humble. If we want to finish our course, if we want

954
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:42,359
to fulfill our ministry, humility is required. In 1 Peter chapter 5 and

955
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,059
James chapter number 4, we read in both of those accounts how the Bible says

956
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:53,219
that God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. What did Paul say

957
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:59,299
in verse number 18? Grace of God be with you, amen? We need God's grace, but we

958
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:03,939
don't get God's grace if we're prideful. That serving grace, I'm thankful for the

959
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:09,259
saving grace, but the serving grace, I can do this. No, no, remain humble. Remain

960
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:16,099
humble. Finally, this morning, number four, depend fully on Christ. Depend fully on

961
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:21,659
Christ. John 15 speaks about the importance of abiding in him. You're the

962
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:31,499
branches, Jesus said, but I am the vine. Where's the life? In the vine. Cut a

963
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:41,379
branch, it dies, right? It withers away. And Jesus says, without me, you can do

964
00:45:41,379 --> 00:45:45,139
nothing. I mentioned that in Sunday school this morning. But I want you to think

965
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:49,659
about this morning, how can I fulfill my ministry? What's the challenge for us this

966
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:55,419
morning? I need to know my ministry. I know what God's called me to do. I need

967
00:45:55,419 --> 00:46:00,979
to keep my eyes on Jesus, because he is the author and finisher of our faith. I

968
00:46:00,979 --> 00:46:07,259
need to remain humble, and I need to fully depend upon him. I'm not gonna do

969
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:11,939
it in my own strength. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna fulfill my ministry. You're not

970
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:15,899
gonna fulfill your ministry in your own strength. You know, one of the most

971
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:25,339
difficult things to do is to serve God in your own strength. It truly is. It's

972
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:32,619
tough. But when you understand that it's him working through you, completely

973
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:37,979
different. In closing, let me read this to you. I read this many, many years ago,

974
00:46:37,979 --> 00:46:45,019
written by a young African pastor tacked to the wall of his house. He said this,

975
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:50,659
I'm part of the fellowship of the unashamed. I have Holy Spirit power. The

976
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:55,459
die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made. I'm

977
00:46:55,459 --> 00:47:05,099
a disciple of his. I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still. My

978
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:11,179
past is redeemed. My presence, my present makes sense. My future is secure. I'm

979
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:17,219
finished and done with low living, sight walking, small planning, smooth knees,

980
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:23,059
colorless dreams, tame visions, mundane talking, cheap living, and dwarfed goals.

981
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:31,579
I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promotions, plaudits, or

982
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:37,139
popularity. I don't have to be right first, tops, recognized, praised, regarded, or

983
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:44,379
rewarded. I now live by faith, lean on his presence, lift by prayer, and labor by

984
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:51,419
power. My face is set. My gait is fast. My goal is heaven. My road is narrow. My way

985
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:58,219
rough. My companions few. My guide, however, is reliable. My mission is clear. I

986
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:04,459
cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back, deluded, or

987
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:09,619
delayed. I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of

988
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:14,339
the adversary, negotiate at the table of the enemy, ponder at the pool of

989
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:20,099
popularity, or meander in the maze of mediocrity. I won't give up, shut up, let

990
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:24,539
up, until I have stayed up, stored up, prayed up, paid up, preached up for the

991
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:34,539
cause of Christ. Why? I am a disciple of Jesus. I must go till he comes, give till

992
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:41,459
I drop, preach till all know, and work till he stops me. And he finishes it by

993
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:47,179
saying this, when he comes for his own, he will have no problem recognizing me. My

994
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:54,539
banner will be clear. All that God would help us to fulfill our ministry.

995
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:00,099
Archippus had been discouraged. People will disappoint you. People will hurt

996
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:08,979
you. Discouragement is real. But Paul, under the inspirational Holy Ghost, God

997
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:16,659
says to Archippus, Archippus, take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in

998
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:22,899
the Lord, that thou fulfill it. And for us this morning, the challenge is clear.

999
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:29,699
We have a ministry. We have to fulfill it. There should be no other option. Quitting

1000
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:40,539
should never even be entertained. I know pastor friends that have quit. Every

1001
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:47,139
month, hundreds of people in the ministry quit. The statistics are known. I've only

1002
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:52,019
been here for ten and a half years. The pastor's fellowship that I'll go to on

1003
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:58,499
Tuesday has many people missing that were there ten years ago. Some that have

1004
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,499
just relocated.

1005
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:04,459
ministry, but some, unfortunately, that are no longer in the ministry.

1006
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:12,059
They got discouraged, and they quit, and I hope that God would help us to have our focus

1007
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:17,019
upon Him and say, Lord, I need Your help.

1008
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:22,039
By God's grace and with God's help, we can fulfill our ministry.

1009
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,039
Let's pray.

1010
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:24,039
Father, we love You.

1011
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:26,939
We thank You for loving us.

1012
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,779
Thank You for the charge this morning.

1013
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:34,579
Thank You for the example, the cloud of witnesses, and I thank You for the challenge.

1014
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,979
I pray that You'd help each of us to respond appropriately this morning, God, that we could

1015
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:46,239
take some very practical truth and apply it in our lives, our hearts, that none of us

1016
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:58,299
would be a castaway, that none of us would throw in the towel, and God, we'd keep our

1017
00:50:58,299 --> 00:51:06,579
eyes on You, and that You'd help us to be able to say, I finished.

1018
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:07,579
I fulfilled.

1019
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:12,719
I did, Lord, what You've called me to do, what You enabled me to do.

1020
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,999
Would You move and work as only You can?

1021
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:16,999
Would You stand with me?
