1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,799
As you study the book of Psalms, you'll find that many times, I mentioned this in Sunday

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,239
school this morning, we're looking in Psalm 34, but you study the book of Psalms and you

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:12,479
have the opportunity to really get insight into the heart and the life of the psalmist.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,600
And many times you read the Psalms and you see the transparency of the psalmist.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,360
You understand that he's a man just like we are humans and we face difficulties just as

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,959
he faced difficulties.

7
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:29,719
And you see that he is, many times David is the one that is the human payment.

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,560
He's not written all the Psalms, all scripture is given by inspiration of God, but God would

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,439
use David to pen a number of the Psalms.

10
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,159
And we find that God gives us great insight into the man, the life of David.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,319
As we study the Psalms, as we read the Psalms, we can be encouraged through the content of

12
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,759
God's word in the book of Psalms.

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,919
Several years ago, I don't do it every year.

14
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:56,580
I read through the Bible a couple of times a year personally in my devotions.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,779
And then other times I'll read it through a couple of times a year, but I'll read the

16
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,740
book of Psalms every month.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,459
And if you read five Psalms a day, you can read through the book of Psalms every month

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,540
of the year.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,739
And I've done that several years.

20
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,059
I'm not doing it this year, but I've done that several years.

21
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:13,260
I know a lot of people do the book of Proverbs, one proverb a day.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,500
You go through the book of Proverbs every month of the year.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,300
I've done that as well.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,019
And when you read through the book of Psalms and you do five a day, man, you get encouraged

25
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,540
and it's just exciting to read the book of Psalms.

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,900
And I know that some have said, well, what happens when you get to Psalm 119?

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,620
You set aside more time to read that day, man.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,099
And that's a good thing, by the way.

29
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,860
And you read through the book of Psalms and your heart is encouraged when you read the

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,300
book of Psalms.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,660
But you also find that as you read the book of Psalms, that you'll be challenged.

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,459
Get the opportunity to read about the life and the behavior of the Psalmist.

33
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,459
And you have just an opportunity to be encouraged, but also to be challenged.

34
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:55,339
And I'm thankful when God's word challenges his people.

35
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm thankful when God's word challenges me personally.

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,180
And we find that as we come to Psalm 54, just as the cases with many of the Psalms, you

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,339
find that there is a particular event that is the background or the setting for that

38
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,820
particular Psalm.

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Now with some of the Psalms, it's a debate and there's a couple of options maybe with

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,940
several of the Psalms where it could have been written during this time in David's life

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,139
or maybe it was this time in David's life.

42
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,259
There are several Psalms that are pretty clear with regard to the timing, the setting for

43
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,619
the particular Psalm, and it is believed and commonly held to that Psalm 54, that the

44
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:35,899
setting for this Psalm is 1 Samuel 23.

45
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:40,539
That's why I've brought you to 1 Samuel 23 by way of introduction to just quickly go

46
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:46,100
through 1 Samuel 23, excuse me, so that we could quickly go through and get the setting,

47
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,460
get the background for this Psalm as we begin to understand that David declares in the midst

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,380
of this wonderful song, I will praise thy name.

49
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,820
And we find that the setting is at Keilah in 1 Samuel 23, and in the first five verses,

50
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,899
I won't take time to read all of 1 Samuel 23, it would be the entirety of the message,

51
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:13,059
but you find that in the first five verses of 1 Samuel 23, that God not only directs

52
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:19,580
but enables David and his men to deliver the city of Keilah from the Philistines.

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,460
We know that the Philistines were a consistent foe, an arch enemy, if you will, of the nation

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,339
of Israel, and you find that God would enable David, he gave clear direction to David to

55
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:35,300
go to Keilah and to fight and to deliver Keilah, and David obeyed the word of the Lord, and

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,259
David saw God work and God blessed in a very special way, and you find that as you move

57
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:45,460
through the text of Scripture, that in verses six through eight, that the Bible tells us

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,539
that Saul would come to the place of Keilah, and Saul had this thought, he had this perspective

59
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:58,820
that David was now in this situation in Keilah, and he was, opportunity was there for Saul

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,380
to go and to catch him.

61
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,380
He says at the end of verse number seven, for he is shut in by entering into a town

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,500
that hath gates and bars, and so Saul thought, this is my opportunity, I now can get David,

63
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,940
and we find that in these verses that Saul calls the people together, and Saul would

64
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,500
come down, and David then inquires of the Lord, and David asks God, is Saul going to

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,619
come, number one, and number two, are the people of Keilah going to deliver me to Saul?

66
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:36,260
God answers those prayers, and God tells David, yes indeed, Saul is on his way, and yes indeed,

67
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,779
the inhabitants of Keilah will deliver you into the hands of Saul.

68
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,380
Now that's a little bit disappointing, isn't it?

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,380
When you think about David going to the city of Keilah, and delivering those very people

70
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,420
from the Philistines, and yet when David's life is going to be in jeopardy, because Saul

71
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,179
is coming and seeking to kill David, that the people that were delivered by David would

72
00:04:57,179 --> 00:05:03,459
turn him over to his enemy.

73
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:11,140
David leaves the city of Keilah, we find that as he leaves the city of Keilah, the Bible

74
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,940
tells us in verse number 14 that Saul was going to seek David every day.

75
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,700
It says that David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained in a mountain

76
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,420
in the wilderness of Ziph.

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:31,779
And so this is the location where he is, and it says this, that Saul sought him every day,

78
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,380
but God delivered him not into his hand.

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,019
Saul would say this in verse number 23 at the end of the verse, that I will search him

80
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,579
out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

81
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:48,140
I've often wondered if with the same intensity that Saul sought David, if he would have sought

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:54,019
the Lord with that same level of intensity, how different his life would have been.

83
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,619
We find that he's seeking to find David, why?

84
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:01,619
So that he could kill David, and so David is there in the wilderness of Ziph according

85
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:07,339
to verse number 14, and then these that are the inhabitants of this area, the Ziphites,

86
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,739
they come to Saul in verse number 19, and notice what they say.

87
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:16,140
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul, to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,899
in strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hakaliah, which is on the south of Jeshamon?

89
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:28,980
Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down,

90
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,380
and our part shall be to deliver him, David, into the king's hand.

91
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,459
So now understand what's taking place.

92
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,820
He's in the wilderness of Ziph, and Saul is seeking him every day.

93
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,540
Saul's purpose, his goal daily is to find David so that he might kill David, and we

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,019
find that he's in the wilderness of Ziph, and Saul is in this place, and obviously not

95
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,260
his hometown, not his backyard, so to speak, and so the inhabitants of the wilderness of

96
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,179
Ziph, the Ziphites, they understand what's taking place, and they come to Saul, and they

97
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:08,660
say, Saul, our part, because we know this area, this, you know, you've heard the phrase

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,980
that somebody say, they know it like the back of their hand, you've heard somebody use that

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,100
phraseology, well, this was their backyard, this was their area, and these Ziphites, they

100
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,739
say to Saul, you let us do our part, and we will deliver David into your hand.

101
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,339
This is what David's dealing with.

102
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,660
The Bible tells us that Saul's seeking for him, notice in verse number 25, David is surrounded,

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,140
the Bible says that Saul also and his men went to seek him, and they told David, wherefore

104
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,940
he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of Maon, and when Saul heard that,

105
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,260
he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon, and Saul went on this side of the mountain,

106
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,619
and David and his men on that side of the mountain, and David made haste to get away

107
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:57,239
for fear of Saul, notice what the Bible says at the end of verse 26, for Saul and his men

108
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:04,119
encompassed David and his men round about to take them.

109
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:09,440
Wow, what circumstances, but God delivered.

110
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,679
In verse number 27, it says, there came a messenger unto Saul, and this messenger comes

111
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:22,959
to Saul, and he says, haste thee and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land.

112
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,799
I don't know how long it took the messenger to get to the wilderness of Ziph, but I am

113
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:33,159
reminded in this passage of Scripture that God's timing is perfect, because David was

114
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:40,840
completely surrounded, and Saul's purpose was to kill David, and in that moment, a messenger

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
comes.

116
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
When did the Philistines invade?

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Not at that moment.

118
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,200
There had to be a period of time for that invasion to take place, for that messenger

119
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,280
to get from there to where Saul was to bring news, and God tells us in verse number 28,

120
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,440
wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David.

121
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
This is not the end of David's trials.

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,119
This is not the end of Saul's pursuit of David.

123
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:09,880
In fact, as you get into the 24th chapter, you read about being there at En Gedi and

124
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,919
all the things that take place, but you find that David is dealing with these adverse circumstances

125
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,760
that we read of here in 1 Samuel 23, and that is the backdrop for our passage that

126
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,039
we're studying this morning in Psalm 54.

127
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,960
So now take and turn over to the book of Psalms, and Psalm 54, I ask you to hold your place

128
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,880
there, and I want you to notice, and I'm going to quickly give an outline for this particular

129
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
psalm.

130
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,080
It begins in verses one and two with a prayer for deliverance.

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,840
Notice what the Bible says.

132
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,799
David says, save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

133
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,400
Hear my prayer, O God, give ear to the words of my mouth.

134
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,799
This is a prayer of deliverance.

135
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,559
I believe I read this text of Scripture, and there's a measure of urgency in the lips of

136
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,760
David as he's praying, save me, O God.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,520
We just read 1 Samuel 23.

138
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,240
We understand the circumstances surrounding the writing

139
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
of this particular psalm,

140
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
and certainly he would pray with a measure of urgency.

141
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,100
You find that the psalmist will pray

142
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,280
in other portions of scripture, help Lord.

143
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,680
He says, save me.

144
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,080
I want you to notice he says,

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,160
by thy name and judge me by thy strength.

146
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm so thankful that God has the ability to deliver.

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm so thankful that he is a very present help

148
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,580
in the time of trouble.

149
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,900
Not only is he available, he's able,

150
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,620
and we can rejoice in that,

151
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,580
and we can take what the psalmist said in Psalm 121

152
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,500
and lift up our eyes under the hills

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,620
from whence cometh our help,

154
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,560
knowing with confidence and with assurance

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,620
that our help cometh from the Lord,

156
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,920
which made heaven and earth.

157
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,020
We sang about how great thou art.

158
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,500
He is the creator God.

159
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,420
He said, let there be light, and there was light.

160
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,740
He spoke all things into existence

161
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,340
by the power that he has,

162
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,900
and he is your helper, he is my helper.

163
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
Man, isn't that awesome?

164
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,220
It begins with a prayer for deliverance.

165
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,900
We find that in verse number three,

166
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
he reveals the circumstances in which he's dealing with.

167
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,420
Notice what he says,

168
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,620
for strangers are risen up against me,

169
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,700
and oppressors seek after my soul.

170
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,360
They have not set God before them, Selah.

171
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,220
You think about the circumstances,

172
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,900
we've mentioned in 1 Samuel chapter 23,

173
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,640
not only was Saul and his men seeking for David,

174
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,580
but we find that the people of Kelah

175
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,940
that he had just delivered,

176
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,740
they were willing to turn David over to Saul.

177
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,220
We find that he escaped so that that would not happen,

178
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,720
and then these inhabitants of the wilderness of Ziph,

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,460
the Ziphites, they say, hey, Saul,

180
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,500
we're gonna help you out.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,100
We'll deliver him into your hand.

182
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,940
And David says that strangers are risen up against me,

183
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,540
and oppressors seek after my soul.

184
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,680
They have not set God before them, Selah.

185
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,660
We find that not only does he reveal his circumstances

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,700
in verse number three,

187
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,980
but he recognizes that God is his helper in verse number four.

188
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,780
Notice what he says, behold, this is precious,

189
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,780
God is mine helper.

190
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,180
God is mine helper.

191
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,020
The Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

192
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,860
Listen, this morning,

193
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,400
I hope that you're recognizing that God is your helper.

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,860
I hope that you recognize that as you go through this life

195
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,680
that you're not going through it alone.

196
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us

197
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,400
that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us

199
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,260
that he'll never leave us nor forsake us.

200
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm thankful that he is our helper.

201
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,740
And we find that David acknowledges this truth,

202
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,920
and he recognizes that God is my helper.

203
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,840
Listen, David was a very skillful military man.

204
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,800
David was a man that had accomplished much.

205
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,160
He had defeated Goliath,

206
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,440
and we find that he had killed numbers of Philistines.

207
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,940
He had just delivered the city of Kelah,

208
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,940
but David recognized it wasn't him, it was God.

209
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
And oh, how important that is for our lives,

210
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,940
for your life and for my life,

211
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,900
that David says the Lord is mine helper.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,720
We find that as we continue to move through the Psalm

213
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,880
in verse number five,

214
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,840
there's an expectation of deliverance.

215
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,640
He said, he shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

216
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,520
Cut them off in thy truth.

217
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,000
We find that he's speaking with expectation.

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,520
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

219
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,480
What God is going to do.

220
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,100
Listen, I'm so thankful that our God is on the throne.

221
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm so thankful that even in the darkest of times,

222
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,240
though we may not understand what God is going to do

223
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
or how God is going to work,

224
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
we may look at the situation,

225
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
at the circumstances being unfavorable,

226
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,940
that there's no way out but God.

227
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,860
How thankful I am for the times

228
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,800
in which you read the word of God

229
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,520
and you read those two words, but God.

230
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
But God.

231
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,780
We find that in verse number six,

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,560
God reveals to us a commitment on the part of the Psalmist

233
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,160
to praise the name of the Lord.

234
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,559
Notice what he says, I will freely sacrifice unto thee.

235
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,559
I will praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

236
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,800
I've used that phrase in verse number six

237
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,440
in the middle of the verse for our title this morning.

238
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,020
I will praise thy name.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,720
We find that in verse number seven,

240
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,800
David recalls past deliverance.

241
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,559
Notice what he says in verse five.

242
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,800
He said, he shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

243
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,540
But in verse number seven, he says,

244
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,440
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble

245
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,240
and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.

246
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,640
You know, it's a good thing for us to rehearse

247
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,119
and to recall what God has done.

248
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,040
It is a beneficial thing.

249
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,460
It's a beneficial practice.

250
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,360
We sing, I think we'll sing the song tonight,

251
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
count your blessings, name them one by one.

252
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
And to begin to think about and recall

253
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,960
the way in which God has worked

254
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,559
and what he has done in the past,

255
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,559
not only does it put you in a state of worshiping God

256
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,500
and praising him and exalting him,

257
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,180
but it also gives you a sense of expectation

258
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,600
of what God is going to do because God is still at work.

259
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
God is still on his throne.

260
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,080
You say, but pastor, I'm going through this situation.

261
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,680
I'm going through that situation.

262
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,720
And David was going through a situation

263
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
in Psalm 54 as he wrote these words.

264
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,400
And every single person has circumstances

265
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,320
and situations that they're dealing with.

266
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,080
And it is not our job to compare my trials

267
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,160
and your trials and someone else's trials,

268
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,600
but understand that God is greater than all of our trials

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,880
and that God has a plan and God has a purpose.

270
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,880
And we find that as we enter into this thought

271
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
from Psalm 54 and noticing what the psalmist says,

272
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,400
I will praise thy name, I wanna take just the remainder

273
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,720
of our time this morning and examine three aspects

274
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,540
of the psalmist and his praise.

275
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,380
Three aspects of the psalmist and his praise.

276
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Number one, if you're taking notes this morning,

277
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,740
I want you to understand that the psalmist

278
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,779
was purposed in his praise.

279
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,580
The psalmist was purposed in his praise.

280
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,020
Notice what the Bible says, I will praise thy name.

281
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,500
I will, that idea of being purposed is to be deliberate,

282
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,180
to be intentional.

283
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,339
The reality is that just as the psalmist

284
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,500
and you can study the Psalms and we'll look at a few verses

285
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,700
here in just a moment, but you can study the Psalms

286
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,020
and you can find where the psalmist is purposed

287
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,820
in his praise, he's deliberate, he's intentional.

288
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,500
And you and I this morning, we too must be purposed

289
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,779
in our praise.

290
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,140
For many of us, I taught in Sunday school this morning

291
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,700
from Psalm 34, I will bless the Lord at all times,

292
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

293
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
And we talked about the fact in this morning

294
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,740
in our Sunday school class that the reality

295
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,460
is that for many of us, our default setting

296
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,920
is not praise, it's complaint.

297
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,600
That's our default setting as human beings.

298
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,360
I think it was Brother Armando that gave the answer

299
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,440
to the question this morning in Sunday school

300
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,140
that we complain about the weather.

301
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,520
And you heard about all the snow in Buffalo

302
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
and then you heard Brother Michael give the report

303
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,839
of all the rain in Scotland.

304
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,839
72 inches, I can't even comprehend that in a month.

305
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,760
But we complain when it's hot, we complain when it's cold.

306
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,600
Listen, many times our default setting is not praise.

307
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
Our default setting is complaint.

308
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,839
And the reality is born again believers

309
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,380
with the spirit of God living within us,

310
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,760
we need to be purposed in our praise

311
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
and we need to get to the place that our default setting

312
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,640
no longer is complaint but is praise, why?

313
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Because of any man being Christ, he's a new creature.

314
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,880
Old things are passed away, behold,

315
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
all things have become new.

316
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,480
And I come to the place now where I'm looking at my life

317
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
and my circumstances, my difficulties, my trials,

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,279
my adversities, I'm looking at them through the lens

319
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,960
that God is good, that God has a purpose,

320
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,360
that God has a plan, that God is on his throne,

321
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,240
that God is up to something, he's working.

322
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,400
Listen, God is moving and God is working.

323
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
And we, listen, when I look at 1 Samuel 23

324
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
and you can look at that passage and say,

325
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
man, that's unfortunate that David

326
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,840
had to deal with all of that.

327
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,119
I'm thankful that I get to read about it.

328
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,320
Why, because my heart's encouraged.

329
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,760
When I read about what David dealt with in 1 Samuel 23,

330
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,760
when I read about how God delivered his servant

331
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,320
that was surrounded by those that wanted to kill him

332
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,119
and God allowed for some other things to take place

333
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,840
so that Saul returns.

334
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,619
And it's awesome to see our God at work.

335
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,280
We find that the psalmist, as you study his life,

336
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,220
you'll find that he's purposed in his praise.

337
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,040
Look over at Psalm 108, if you will.

338
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,919
Look at a few verses of scripture this morning

339
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,640
and look at the heart of the psalmist

340
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,160
and his praise, he's purposed.

341
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,559
In Psalm 108, beginning in verse number one,

342
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,559
the Bible says this, Psalm 108 and verse number one,

343
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,640
oh God, my heart is fixed.

344
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I will sing and give praise even with my glory.

345
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Awake, psaltery and harp.

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,200
I myself will awake early.

347
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,160
I will praise thee, oh Lord, among the people

348
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,160
and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

349
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
Why, notice what he says in verse number four.

350
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
For thy mercy is great above the heavens

351
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,940
and thy truth reacheth under the clouds.

352
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,780
Our God is.

353
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,020
He's merciful.

354
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,260
Our God has given us truth.

355
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,100
And here the psalmist, another psalm that's ascribed to David, he says that my heart is

356
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,960
fixed.

357
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,180
He says that I will sing and give praise.

358
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,900
He says, I will praise Thee, and I will praise Thee among the people, and I will sing praises

359
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,340
unto Thee among the nations.

360
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,560
He's not fearful to praise God publicly, amen?

361
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,260
By the way, we need to praise God publicly.

362
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,080
Let people know how good our God is.

363
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,780
Let people know what your God has done for you, and how He's saved you, and how He's

364
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,160
blessed you, and how He's worked in and through your life.

365
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:46,160
We find that the psalmist's purpose, notice in Psalm 139, we're familiar with Psalm 139

366
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,960
in this portion of scripture, but we find that the psalmist says, when you think about

367
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,500
the, again, the intentional, the deliberate perspective of the psalmist with regard to

368
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,780
praise, notice what he says in Psalm 139 in verse number 14, I will praise Thee.

369
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
Why?

370
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:11,020
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are Thy works, and that my soul knoweth right

371
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,980
well.

372
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,060
I will praise Thee.

373
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
I will praise Thee.

374
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,180
You read Psalm 150.

375
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,640
We won't take time to read it this morning, but if you read Psalm 150, you'll find that

376
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,000
the psalmist says, let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Praise ye the Lord.

378
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,280
And as you read, it's only six verses in Psalm 150, but as you read Psalm 150, you will find

379
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,800
that the psalmist is understanding that I'm going to praise God, first of all, for who

380
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,560
He is, and then I'm going to praise God for what He has done.

381
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,060
Listen this morning, if we learn to praise God for who He is, we will never lack reason

382
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,540
to rejoice.

383
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,780
Why?

384
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,860
Because He's immutable.

385
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,740
He never changes.

386
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,660
Your circumstances change.

387
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,700
You might be on a mountaintop today.

388
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,860
You might be in the valley today.

389
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Your circumstances are ever-changing, but God is consistent.

390
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,560
God is constant.

391
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,780
God is immutable.

392
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,700
He is the same yesterday and today and forever, and we find that He is gracious and He is

393
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,880
merciful and He is loving toward us, and we think about all of His attributes, and we

394
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,800
think about learning to rejoice in who He is.

395
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
He's good.

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,120
We sang this morning, how great thou art, our God is great.

397
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,480
This morning, we find that the psalmist, as we study, we read through the Psalms, we find

398
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,800
that He was purposed in His praise, and I, too, we, too, must be purposed in our praise.

399
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,220
We must be deliberate.

400
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,740
We must be intentional.

401
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,240
We must make it a part of our lives, not just going through some rote religious activity,

402
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,860
not just going through the motions, but purposefully every day.

403
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,320
As the psalmist said in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath made.

404
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,520
We will rejoice and be glad in it, but that guy cut me off, but I got, somebody said they

405
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
got a flat tire.

406
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I got this.

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I got that, but it's the day the Lord hath made, and I'm going to rejoice because God

408
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,800
has a plan and God has a purpose.

409
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
Now, bear this with me.

410
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,440
The psalmist, not only was he purposed in His praise, but number two, the psalmist was

411
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,120
persistent in his praise, persistent in his praise.

412
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
I would say this.

413
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,440
No matter the circumstances, no matter how I feel, no matter how you feel, no matter

414
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,360
what circumstances you deal with, you ought to praise God, amen?

415
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,320
He's worthy of our praise, and the psalmist was persistent.

416
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,180
David was persistent in his praise.

417
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,620
We find that as we begin to look at the truth that God is good, He's good all of the time,

418
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,500
and He's worthy of our praise, and we find that our circumstances I mentioned a moment

419
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:55,020
ago may change, but God never changes, and we find that we're to praise Him persistently.

420
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,820
You know, there are times in our life when things seem to be going well, when things

421
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,500
seem to be on that mountaintop, so to speak, type of an experience, and it seems like it's

422
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,300
easy to praise God in those types of circumstances.

423
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,300
When you're in the valley, it's a little bit more challenging, but we must be persistent

424
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,420
in our praise because God is good on the mountaintop, and God is good in the valley.

425
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,920
You know what I've learned in life?

426
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,540
Some of the hardest times in the valley end up being some of the sweetest times you'll

427
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,460
ever have with the Lord.

428
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:38,020
You get to know God in a much more personal, intimate way when you're in the valley.

429
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
You really do.

430
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,060
You say, pastor, you're saying you want to be in the valley?

431
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,480
No.

432
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,980
I'm just telling you by experience, the valley is a sweet place to be with the Lord, and

433
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,060
sometimes God will take us into the valley so that we can learn to trust Him, so we can

434
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,540
learn to depend on Him, so we can learn that He is who He says He is.

435
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,900
You can't live life on the top of the mountain 24-7, 365.

436
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,220
God took His servants into the storm.

437
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,500
God will take us into storms, and you learn so much about Him.

438
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,200
Psalm 52, remember the circumstances as you're turning to Psalm 52.

439
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,160
Remember the circumstances, the setting for this particular psalm here in Psalm 54, the

440
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,320
setting of 1 Samuel 23.

441
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,800
The men of Kelah that had just been delivered going to turn David over to Saul, Saul seeking

442
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:44,620
for him, the Ziphites saying, hey, we'll help you find him, and David says, I will.

443
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,400
Praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

444
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,440
He's persistent in his praise.

445
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,080
In Psalm 52, in verse number 9, the Bible says, I will praise thee.

446
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,320
Notice what it says, forever, because thou hast done it, and I will wait on thy name

447
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,120
for it is good before thy saints.

448
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,040
Notice that little phrase, forever.

449
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,800
I will praise thee forever.

450
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
He's worthy.

451
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,520
Listen, you understand in a real sense, when we think about the truth of forever, that

452
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,160
we will praise Him for all of eternity.

453
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,200
You read the book of Revelation, you begin to see the throne room of heaven in Revelation

454
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,200
4 and 5 and see what's taking place, and you say, we will praise Him forever and ever.

455
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
But forever begins now.

456
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm going to praise Him persistently, perpetually.

457
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
His praise shall be on my lips.

458
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,400
He says, I will praise thee forever.

459
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,560
Yeah, but David, your circumstances are going to change.

460
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,720
Yes, but God doesn't, and I will praise Him forever, amen?

461
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,880
He's persistent.

462
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:55,360
Notice in Psalm 113, in verse number 3, look at a couple of other psalms here, but Psalm

463
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
113 and verse number 3, notice what the Bible says.

464
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
I'll begin in verse number 1, as the psalmist is giving this instruction here, in verse

465
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,640
number 1 of Psalm 113, he says, praise ye the Lord, praise, O ye servants of the Lord,

466
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,760
praise the name of the Lord.

467
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Seem like he wants us to praise Him, amen?

468
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,480
Verse 2, blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.

469
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,040
Notice verse number 3, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the

470
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,600
Lord's name is to be praised.

471
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,360
Who's the one doing the praising?

472
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,400
The people of God, right?

473
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,520
And so, you notice, he says, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same,

474
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
the Lord's name is to be praised.

475
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,880
And, listen, don't be the naysayer and say, okay, so when the sun's not out, I don't have

476
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
to praise Him.

477
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,600
That's not what he's talking about, amen?

478
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,440
And we get the idea, as we look at the psalmist here, and we look at the truth of the Word

479
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,440
of God, that we're to be persistent in our praise.

480
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,040
The psalmist said this, and you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 145, in verse

481
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,640
number 2, the Bible says, every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name forever

482
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
and ever.

483
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,760
The next verse says, great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and His greatness is

484
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
unsearchable.

485
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,480
And the psalmist says, I will praise the Lord every day will I bless thee, and I will praise

486
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,040
thy name forever and ever.

487
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,940
It's not only being purposed, but it's being persistent in our praise.

488
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,920
It's understanding that every single day that God is the same, and that God has a plan and

489
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
a purpose.

490
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,880
And we find that as we look at the Word of God, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, the Bible

491
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,520
says, rejoice evermore.

492
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,040
In Philippians chapter number 4, the Bible says, rejoice in the Lord always, and again

493
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,280
I say rejoice.

494
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,440
We find that Paul was a man that God would use to pen those letters, those letters to

495
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,680
those churches about rejoicing, but Paul was a man that rejoiced.

496
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,840
It's interesting as you read the letters that Paul writes under the inspiration of the Holy

497
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,200
Spirit of God, if you read the beginning section of each of those letters, you find very consistently

498
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,520
that Paul is praising God.

499
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,480
Paul is being thankful.

500
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,800
He's writing to the church in Corinth, by the way, not a model church, and he talks

501
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,480
in 1 Corinthians 1 about thanking God who is faithful.

502
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
That's what he says.

503
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
God is faithful.

504
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,480
I've got to deal with a whole lot of nonsense in the church in Corinth, and he's going to

505
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,920
give it to them in the book of 1 Corinthians.

506
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,040
There's correction that is needed, but he begins by saying, I'm praising God because

507
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,280
He's faithful.

508
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,360
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

509
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
All our God is faithful.

510
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,640
We must be purposed in our praise, just as the psalmist was.

511
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,920
We must be persistent in our praise, just as the psalmist was, and I will say this,

512
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,840
we must be passionate in our praise, just as the psalmist was.

513
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,680
The psalmist was passionate in his praise.

514
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,880
Notice what he says in Psalm 9 in verse number 1.

515
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,800
I love the phraseology here,

516
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,960
and it's certainly convicting.

517
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,680
As we begin to see what's taking place,

518
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,760
and we find that the psalmist is revealing to us

519
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,960
this passion in which he would praise the Lord.

520
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,840
In fact, as you study the life of David,

521
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,880
and you see what's taking place in his life,

522
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,160
and you begin to look at various aspects of his life,

523
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,760
as you read the book of 1 Samuel,

524
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,240
you see a man that passionately prays God.

525
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,080
Amen?

526
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,600
I mean, he's passionate about it.

527
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,800
Do you remember the scene when they're bringing

528
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,160
the ark back to Jerusalem?

529
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,720
I mean, there is rejoicing that is taking place.

530
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,580
I mean, it is a big deal, and there is passionate praise.

531
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,760
We find that the psalmist said this in Psalm 9,

532
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,940
in verse number one, I will praise thee, O Lord,

533
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,940
notice what it says, with my whole heart.

534
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,360
I will show forth all thy marvelous works.

535
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,180
My whole heart.

536
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,240
It's passionate.

537
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,580
It's not half-hearted praise.

538
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,940
It's not praising God because someone's making me

539
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,180
praise God, it's praising him because he's worthy

540
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,540
of my praise, and he deserves our praise,

541
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,180
and he's been so abundantly good to us,

542
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,340
and I'm gonna praise him with my whole heart.

543
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,140
You say, but other people are gonna say.

544
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,980
Doesn't matter.

545
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,660
You watch sporting events.

546
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,260
Those people go crazy for some sports team

547
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,340
because they won some game.

548
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,180
That in the light of eternity isn't gonna matter at all.

549
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,540
I remember sitting in a church in England five years ago,

550
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,560
and the setting in England is different than it is here.

551
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,520
In fact, as you go to churches in America,

552
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,260
you find that there's different settings, even America.

553
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,100
We're kind of in a little bit of an in-between,

554
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,600
but man, if you go down south, man,

555
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,020
they're shouting and praising God and amen

556
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,260
as you're preaching, and they're preaching from the pew

557
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,540
as you're preaching from the pulpit.

558
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,160
I mean, they're excited about praising God, amen.

559
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,240
You get up into New England, and it's very proper,

560
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,540
and very, we're somewhere in the middle,

561
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,779
but over in England, I mean, it was just extremely formal

562
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,300
and just very different.

563
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,059
I remember standing up to sing,

564
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,980
and we stood up to sing that first song,

565
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,660
and we had the hymnal, and man, I don't sing on tune,

566
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,620
but I sing loud, man.

567
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,700
God said, make a joyful noise unto the Lord,

568
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,520
and I stood up to sing, and it was like

569
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,100
I was the only one singing in the place.

570
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,240
I was like, whoa, I gotta lower it down a little bit, right?

571
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,100
And it was just the way it was.

572
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,460
And I remember talking to our missionary, Jared Clement,

573
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,220
and I said something to him about, we're just talking.

574
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,180
I wasn't criticizing.

575
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,460
I was just inquiring, and he said, well, you know,

576
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,419
they're just, the English people,

577
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:48,940
they're just not very passionate, and so on and so forth.

578
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,260
I was like, I've seen clips of them watching football,

579
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,260
soccer, those guys are nuts, right?

580
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,120
Listen, we ought to be passionate for our God, amen,

581
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,460
with my whole heart.

582
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,620
I'm not saying be fleshly, be carnal.

583
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm not saying hang from rafters and crazy stuff,

584
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,380
but I'm saying it ought to be a wholehearted worship.

585
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,880
The psalmist says, I will praise thee,

586
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,279
but he says, with my whole heart.

587
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,880
In Psalm 86, in verse number 12, the psalmist says this,

588
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,419
and again, just being consistent with this thought

589
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:30,440
of being passionate, he says,

590
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,120
I will praise thee, O Lord, my God, with all my heart,

591
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,160
and I will glorify thy name forevermore.

592
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,660
Some of you would know the name of Matthew Henry.

593
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,360
He's a theologian of yesteryear that God used

594
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
to write a commentary series.

595
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,840
I very rarely look at Matthew Henry's commentary.

596
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,720
Some people have it, I have a copy of it.

597
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,300
I very rarely use, I don't use commentaries a ton,

598
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,160
but there's an account in the life of Matthew Henry

599
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,120
that some of you may be familiar with,

600
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,040
and it goes well with this thought

601
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,840
of I will praise thy name.

602
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,880
I will praise him, I'll be purposed,

603
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,520
just as the psalmist was.

604
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,000
I will be persistent, I will be passionate.

605
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,399
The account goes like this,

606
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,559
that Matthew Henry, one day, he was robbed.

607
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,959
A man came and pulled a weapon on him

608
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,640
and robbed him of his wallet.

609
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,440
It was a very unfortunate situation,

610
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,119
but Matthew Henry went home

611
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,720
and began to journal about that situation,

612
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,520
and he had determined in his heart

613
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,440
that he was gonna praise God.

614
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,880
Prior to this event ever happening,

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,600
he had purposed, I'm gonna praise God,

616
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,959
just as we preach this morning,

617
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,360
just as we look at the example of the psalmist.

618
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,619
He began to write, and it's said that in this account

619
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,440
that he writes, I'm thankful that I was the one

620
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,600
that was robbed and not the one doing the robbing.

621
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,040
Hmm.

622
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,360
Okay.

623
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,640
He says, I'm thankful, listen to this,

624
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,980
I'm thankful that they took everything I have,

625
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,339
but it wasn't much.

626
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm thankful that they just robbed me and didn't kill me.

627
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,440
Yeah.

628
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,000
There were other things on his list,

629
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,220
but those are the three that I'll share with you.

630
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,559
And I want you to think about that perspective.

631
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,899
We read of David and his praise.

632
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:51,399
We see the event in 1 Samuel 23.

633
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,440
We read of Paul and of his praise,

634
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,279
even in Acts 16, when they're beaten and imprisoned

635
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,679
and they're praising God.

636
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,119
We see a man named Matthew Henry

637
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:06,160
that was robbed one day.

638
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,119
I've never been robbed.

639
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,720
I hope to never be robbed.

640
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,959
But if I'd be honest with you this morning,

641
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,559
and if you'd be honest with me this morning,

642
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,880
if you were robbed on the way here,

643
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,000
that probably would not be the first three things

644
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
out of your mouth, and probably wouldn't be

645
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,200
the first three things out of my mouth.

646
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,959
Can we be transparent this morning?

647
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,959
But we need to get to the place where the psalmist is.

648
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,600
See, I'm gonna be purposed in my praise.

649
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,279
I'm gonna be intentional and deliberate about praising God,

650
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,160
because God is good.

651
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,959
I'm gonna be persistent, no matter the circumstances,

652
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,640
no matter what's going on, from the rising of the sun

653
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,080
to the going down of the same.

654
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,559
I'm gonna praise his name from this day forth and forever.

655
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,619
I'm going to praise my God.

656
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,619
And I'm gonna be passionate about it.

657
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,899
With my whole heart, I'm gonna praise him.

658
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:04,459
See, whether you're on the mountaintop

659
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:07,459
or you're in the valley, God wants to hear your praise.

660
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,660
Someone wrote the song years ago,

661
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,700
God Wants to Hear You Sing, and he does.

662
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,820
He wants to hear your praise, and he's worthy of it.

663
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,179
And oh, that God would help us this morning.

664
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,580
I said it in Sunday school to close the Sunday school hour.

665
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,399
As God's people, we don't need a federal holiday

666
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:28,820
to cause us to be thankful.

667
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,980
I am thankful that we have a federal holiday on our calendar

668
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,820
that causes us to be more aware of

669
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,140
and focused on at this time of year.

670
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,059
I'm thankful for that.

671
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,200
But the reality is that every single day,

672
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,399
we ought to be thanking God.

673
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:55,959
Oh, that God would help us to not be caught up

674
00:37:55,959 --> 00:38:00,200
in the culture and the society of being an unthankful people

675
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,399
or a complaining people,

676
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:04,200
but that God would help us to praise his name.

677
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,040
Let's pray together.

678
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Father, we love you.

679
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,760
How we thank you for loving us.

680
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
We thank you for the word of God.

681
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,399
We thank you for the truth contained therein.

682
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,980
We thank you for the example of the psalmist.

683
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,140
And Lord, as we look at the example of the psalmist,

684
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,600
we are challenged.

685
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,179
I pray that you would help each of us, Lord,

686
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:29,380
to be purposed, to be persistent,

687
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,940
to be passionate in our praise of thee.

688
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,179
Lord, perhaps there's one here that's not sure of heaven.

689
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,739
They've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

690
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:41,919
as their personal savior.

691
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,960
If they were to die today,

692
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,660
they do not have assurance that heaven is their home.

693
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,619
Oh God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God

694
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:50,739
would speak to the heart of that individual

695
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:54,059
and help them to understand their need for Christ.

696
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,419
I pray they'd understand that, God, you love them.

697
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,900
You sent your son to die for them.

698
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,700
He suffered, bled and died.

699
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,380
He was buried in a borrowed tomb,

700
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,700
but he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

701
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,260
He's alive forevermore.

702
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,460
And he is the savior of the world.

703
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:15,080
God, if there's one in that condition

704
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,919
that needs to be saved,

705
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:18,419
I pray that you would give us an opportunity

706
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,059
to take a Bible and show them

707
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:22,739
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

708
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:25,099
Lord, I pray for Christians this morning

709
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,580
that are gathered together.

710
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,039
Oh God, I pray that you'd help us in this area of our praise.

711
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:36,299
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to respond now

712
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:37,539
to that which we have heard.

713
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:41,260
I pray that you'd move, work as only you can.

714
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,020
We'll thank you for every decision that's made

715
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,419
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

716
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:45,619
Would you stand with me?
