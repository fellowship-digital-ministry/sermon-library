00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
As you study the book of Psalms, you'll find that many times, I mentioned this in Sunday

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.239
school this morning, we're looking in Psalm 34, but you study the book of Psalms and you

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:12.479
have the opportunity to really get insight into the heart and the life of the psalmist.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.600
And many times you read the Psalms and you see the transparency of the psalmist.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.360
You understand that he's a man just like we are humans and we face difficulties just as

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.959
he faced difficulties.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:29.719
And you see that he is, many times David is the one that is the human payment.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.560
He's not written all the Psalms, all scripture is given by inspiration of God, but God would

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.439
use David to pen a number of the Psalms.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:41.159
And we find that God gives us great insight into the man, the life of David.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.319
As we study the Psalms, as we read the Psalms, we can be encouraged through the content of

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.759
God's word in the book of Psalms.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.919
Several years ago, I don't do it every year.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:56.580
I read through the Bible a couple of times a year personally in my devotions.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.779
And then other times I'll read it through a couple of times a year, but I'll read the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:01.740
book of Psalms every month.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.459
And if you read five Psalms a day, you can read through the book of Psalms every month

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.540
of the year.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.739
And I've done that several years.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.059
I'm not doing it this year, but I've done that several years.

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.260
I know a lot of people do the book of Proverbs, one proverb a day.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.500
You go through the book of Proverbs every month of the year.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.300
I've done that as well.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.019
And when you read through the book of Psalms and you do five a day, man, you get encouraged

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:25.540
and it's just exciting to read the book of Psalms.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.900
And I know that some have said, well, what happens when you get to Psalm 119?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620
You set aside more time to read that day, man.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.099
And that's a good thing, by the way.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.860
And you read through the book of Psalms and your heart is encouraged when you read the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.300
book of Psalms.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.660
But you also find that as you read the book of Psalms, that you'll be challenged.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.459
Get the opportunity to read about the life and the behavior of the Psalmist.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.459
And you have just an opportunity to be encouraged, but also to be challenged.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.339
And I'm thankful when God's word challenges his people.

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:58.860
I'm thankful when God's word challenges me personally.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.180
And we find that as we come to Psalm 54, just as the cases with many of the Psalms, you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.339
find that there is a particular event that is the background or the setting for that

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:09.820
particular Psalm.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.820
Now with some of the Psalms, it's a debate and there's a couple of options maybe with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.940
several of the Psalms where it could have been written during this time in David's life

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.139
or maybe it was this time in David's life.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.259
There are several Psalms that are pretty clear with regard to the timing, the setting for

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.619
the particular Psalm, and it is believed and commonly held to that Psalm 54, that the

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:35.899
setting for this Psalm is 1 Samuel 23.

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:40.539
That's why I've brought you to 1 Samuel 23 by way of introduction to just quickly go

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:46.100
through 1 Samuel 23, excuse me, so that we could quickly go through and get the setting,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.460
get the background for this Psalm as we begin to understand that David declares in the midst

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.380
of this wonderful song, I will praise thy name.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.820
And we find that the setting is at Keilah in 1 Samuel 23, and in the first five verses,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.899
I won't take time to read all of 1 Samuel 23, it would be the entirety of the message,

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:13.059
but you find that in the first five verses of 1 Samuel 23, that God not only directs

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:19.580
but enables David and his men to deliver the city of Keilah from the Philistines.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.460
We know that the Philistines were a consistent foe, an arch enemy, if you will, of the nation

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.339
of Israel, and you find that God would enable David, he gave clear direction to David to

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:35.300
go to Keilah and to fight and to deliver Keilah, and David obeyed the word of the Lord, and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.259
David saw God work and God blessed in a very special way, and you find that as you move

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:45.460
through the text of Scripture, that in verses six through eight, that the Bible tells us

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.539
that Saul would come to the place of Keilah, and Saul had this thought, he had this perspective

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:58.820
that David was now in this situation in Keilah, and he was, opportunity was there for Saul

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.380
to go and to catch him.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.380
He says at the end of verse number seven, for he is shut in by entering into a town

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.500
that hath gates and bars, and so Saul thought, this is my opportunity, I now can get David,

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.940
and we find that in these verses that Saul calls the people together, and Saul would

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.500
come down, and David then inquires of the Lord, and David asks God, is Saul going to

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.619
come, number one, and number two, are the people of Keilah going to deliver me to Saul?

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:36.260
God answers those prayers, and God tells David, yes indeed, Saul is on his way, and yes indeed,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.779
the inhabitants of Keilah will deliver you into the hands of Saul.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.380
Now that's a little bit disappointing, isn't it?

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.380
When you think about David going to the city of Keilah, and delivering those very people

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.420
from the Philistines, and yet when David's life is going to be in jeopardy, because Saul

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.179
is coming and seeking to kill David, that the people that were delivered by David would

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:03.459
turn him over to his enemy.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:11.140
David leaves the city of Keilah, we find that as he leaves the city of Keilah, the Bible

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.940
tells us in verse number 14 that Saul was going to seek David every day.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.700
It says that David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained in a mountain

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.420
in the wilderness of Ziph.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:31.779
And so this is the location where he is, and it says this, that Saul sought him every day,

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.380
but God delivered him not into his hand.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.019
Saul would say this in verse number 23 at the end of the verse, that I will search him

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.579
out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:48.140
I've often wondered if with the same intensity that Saul sought David, if he would have sought

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.019
the Lord with that same level of intensity, how different his life would have been.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.619
We find that he's seeking to find David, why?

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:01.619
So that he could kill David, and so David is there in the wilderness of Ziph according

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:07.339
to verse number 14, and then these that are the inhabitants of this area, the Ziphites,

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.739
they come to Saul in verse number 19, and notice what they say.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:16.140
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul, to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.899
in strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hakaliah, which is on the south of Jeshamon?

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:28.980
Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.380
and our part shall be to deliver him, David, into the king's hand.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.459
So now understand what's taking place.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.820
He's in the wilderness of Ziph, and Saul is seeking him every day.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.540
Saul's purpose, his goal daily is to find David so that he might kill David, and we

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.019
find that he's in the wilderness of Ziph, and Saul is in this place, and obviously not

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:57.260
his hometown, not his backyard, so to speak, and so the inhabitants of the wilderness of

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.179
Ziph, the Ziphites, they understand what's taking place, and they come to Saul, and they

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:08.660
say, Saul, our part, because we know this area, this, you know, you've heard the phrase

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.980
that somebody say, they know it like the back of their hand, you've heard somebody use that

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.100
phraseology, well, this was their backyard, this was their area, and these Ziphites, they

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:24.739
say to Saul, you let us do our part, and we will deliver David into your hand.

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:27.339
This is what David's dealing with.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:32.660
The Bible tells us that Saul's seeking for him, notice in verse number 25, David is surrounded,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.140
the Bible says that Saul also and his men went to seek him, and they told David, wherefore

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.940
he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of Maon, and when Saul heard that,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.260
he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon, and Saul went on this side of the mountain,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.619
and David and his men on that side of the mountain, and David made haste to get away

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:57.239
for fear of Saul, notice what the Bible says at the end of verse 26, for Saul and his men

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:04.119
encompassed David and his men round about to take them.

00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:09.440
Wow, what circumstances, but God delivered.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.679
In verse number 27, it says, there came a messenger unto Saul, and this messenger comes

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:22.959
to Saul, and he says, haste thee and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land.

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:27.799
I don't know how long it took the messenger to get to the wilderness of Ziph, but I am

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:33.159
reminded in this passage of Scripture that God's timing is perfect, because David was

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:40.840
completely surrounded, and Saul's purpose was to kill David, and in that moment, a messenger

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840
comes.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840
When did the Philistines invade?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.880
Not at that moment.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.200
There had to be a period of time for that invasion to take place, for that messenger

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.280
to get from there to where Saul was to bring news, and God tells us in verse number 28,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.440
wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.440
This is not the end of David's trials.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.119
This is not the end of Saul's pursuit of David.

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:09.880
In fact, as you get into the 24th chapter, you read about being there at En Gedi and

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.919
all the things that take place, but you find that David is dealing with these adverse circumstances

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:21.760
that we read of here in 1 Samuel 23, and that is the backdrop for our passage that

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.039
we're studying this morning in Psalm 54.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:27.960
So now take and turn over to the book of Psalms, and Psalm 54, I ask you to hold your place

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.880
there, and I want you to notice, and I'm going to quickly give an outline for this particular

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
psalm.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.080
It begins in verses one and two with a prayer for deliverance.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.840
Notice what the Bible says.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.799
David says, save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:49.400
Hear my prayer, O God, give ear to the words of my mouth.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.799
This is a prayer of deliverance.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:56.559
I believe I read this text of Scripture, and there's a measure of urgency in the lips of

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.760
David as he's praying, save me, O God.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.520
We just read 1 Samuel 23.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.240
We understand the circumstances surrounding the writing

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.760
of this particular psalm,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.120
and certainly he would pray with a measure of urgency.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.100
You find that the psalmist will pray

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.280
in other portions of scripture, help Lord.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.680
He says, save me.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.080
I want you to notice he says,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.160
by thy name and judge me by thy strength.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.680
I'm so thankful that God has the ability to deliver.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.400
I'm so thankful that he is a very present help

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.580
in the time of trouble.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.900
Not only is he available, he's able,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.620
and we can rejoice in that,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.580
and we can take what the psalmist said in Psalm 121

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.500
and lift up our eyes under the hills

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.620
from whence cometh our help,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.560
knowing with confidence and with assurance

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.620
that our help cometh from the Lord,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.920
which made heaven and earth.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.020
We sang about how great thou art.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.500
He is the creator God.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.420
He said, let there be light, and there was light.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.740
He spoke all things into existence

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.340
by the power that he has,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.900
and he is your helper, he is my helper.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.100
Man, isn't that awesome?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.220
It begins with a prayer for deliverance.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.900
We find that in verse number three,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.400
he reveals the circumstances in which he's dealing with.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.420
Notice what he says,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.620
for strangers are risen up against me,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.700
and oppressors seek after my soul.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.360
They have not set God before them, Selah.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.220
You think about the circumstances,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.900
we've mentioned in 1 Samuel chapter 23,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.640
not only was Saul and his men seeking for David,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.580
but we find that the people of Kelah

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.940
that he had just delivered,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.740
they were willing to turn David over to Saul.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.220
We find that he escaped so that that would not happen,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.720
and then these inhabitants of the wilderness of Ziph,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.460
the Ziphites, they say, hey, Saul,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.500
we're gonna help you out.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.100
We'll deliver him into your hand.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.940
And David says that strangers are risen up against me,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.540
and oppressors seek after my soul.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.680
They have not set God before them, Selah.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.660
We find that not only does he reveal his circumstances

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.700
in verse number three,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.980
but he recognizes that God is his helper in verse number four.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.780
Notice what he says, behold, this is precious,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.780
God is mine helper.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.180
God is mine helper.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.020
The Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.860
Listen, this morning,

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.400
I hope that you're recognizing that God is your helper.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.860
I hope that you recognize that as you go through this life

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.680
that you're not going through it alone.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.680
I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.400
that the Holy Spirit of God indwells us.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.280
I'm thankful that the Bible teaches us

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.260
that he'll never leave us nor forsake us.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.960
I'm thankful that he is our helper.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.740
And we find that David acknowledges this truth,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.920
and he recognizes that God is my helper.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.840
Listen, David was a very skillful military man.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.800
David was a man that had accomplished much.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.160
He had defeated Goliath,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.440
and we find that he had killed numbers of Philistines.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.940
He had just delivered the city of Kelah,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.940
but David recognized it wasn't him, it was God.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.120
And oh, how important that is for our lives,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.940
for your life and for my life,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.900
that David says the Lord is mine helper.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.720
We find that as we continue to move through the Psalm

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.880
in verse number five,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.840
there's an expectation of deliverance.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.640
He said, he shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.520
Cut them off in thy truth.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.000
We find that he's speaking with expectation.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.520
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.480
What God is going to do.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.100
Listen, I'm so thankful that our God is on the throne.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.200
I'm so thankful that even in the darkest of times,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.240
though we may not understand what God is going to do

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.080
or how God is going to work,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.720
we may look at the situation,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.440
at the circumstances being unfavorable,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.940
that there's no way out but God.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.860
How thankful I am for the times

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.800
in which you read the word of God

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.520
and you read those two words, but God.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.720
But God.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.780
We find that in verse number six,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.560
God reveals to us a commitment on the part of the Psalmist

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.160
to praise the name of the Lord.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.559
Notice what he says, I will freely sacrifice unto thee.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:23.559
I will praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:27.800
I've used that phrase in verse number six

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.440
in the middle of the verse for our title this morning.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.020
I will praise thy name.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.720
We find that in verse number seven,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.800
David recalls past deliverance.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.559
Notice what he says in verse five.

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.800
He said, he shall reward evil unto mine enemies.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.540
But in verse number seven, he says,

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.440
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.240
and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.640
You know, it's a good thing for us to rehearse

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.119
and to recall what God has done.

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:02.040
It is a beneficial thing.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.460
It's a beneficial practice.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.360
We sing, I think we'll sing the song tonight,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.720
count your blessings, name them one by one.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.040
And to begin to think about and recall

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.960
the way in which God has worked

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.559
and what he has done in the past,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.559
not only does it put you in a state of worshiping God

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:19.500
and praising him and exalting him,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.180
but it also gives you a sense of expectation

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.600
of what God is going to do because God is still at work.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.200
God is still on his throne.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.080
You say, but pastor, I'm going through this situation.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.680
I'm going through that situation.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.720
And David was going through a situation

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720
in Psalm 54 as he wrote these words.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.400
And every single person has circumstances

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.320
and situations that they're dealing with.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080
And it is not our job to compare my trials

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.160
and your trials and someone else's trials,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.600
but understand that God is greater than all of our trials

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.880
and that God has a plan and God has a purpose.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.880
And we find that as we enter into this thought

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.880
from Psalm 54 and noticing what the psalmist says,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.400
I will praise thy name, I wanna take just the remainder

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.720
of our time this morning and examine three aspects

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.540
of the psalmist and his praise.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.380
Three aspects of the psalmist and his praise.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.380
Number one, if you're taking notes this morning,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.740
I want you to understand that the psalmist

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.779
was purposed in his praise.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:22.580
The psalmist was purposed in his praise.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.020
Notice what the Bible says, I will praise thy name.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.500
I will, that idea of being purposed is to be deliberate,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.180
to be intentional.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.339
The reality is that just as the psalmist

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:38.500
and you can study the Psalms and we'll look at a few verses

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.700
here in just a moment, but you can study the Psalms

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.020
and you can find where the psalmist is purposed

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.820
in his praise, he's deliberate, he's intentional.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.500
And you and I this morning, we too must be purposed

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.779
in our praise.

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:53.140
For many of us, I taught in Sunday school this morning

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.700
from Psalm 34, I will bless the Lord at all times,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.700
his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.700
And we talked about the fact in this morning

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.740
in our Sunday school class that the reality

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.460
is that for many of us, our default setting

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.920
is not praise, it's complaint.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.600
That's our default setting as human beings.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.360
I think it was Brother Armando that gave the answer

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.440
to the question this morning in Sunday school

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.140
that we complain about the weather.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.520
And you heard about all the snow in Buffalo

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.160
and then you heard Brother Michael give the report

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.839
of all the rain in Scotland.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.839
72 inches, I can't even comprehend that in a month.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.760
But we complain when it's hot, we complain when it's cold.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.600
Listen, many times our default setting is not praise.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.360
Our default setting is complaint.

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:44.839
And the reality is born again believers

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:47.380
with the spirit of God living within us,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.760
we need to be purposed in our praise

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.080
and we need to get to the place that our default setting

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.640
no longer is complaint but is praise, why?

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.440
Because of any man being Christ, he's a new creature.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.880
Old things are passed away, behold,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.160
all things have become new.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.480
And I come to the place now where I'm looking at my life

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.000
and my circumstances, my difficulties, my trials,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.279
my adversities, I'm looking at them through the lens

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:15.960
that God is good, that God has a purpose,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.360
that God has a plan, that God is on his throne,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.240
that God is up to something, he's working.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.400
Listen, God is moving and God is working.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.200
And we, listen, when I look at 1 Samuel 23

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.720
and you can look at that passage and say,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.720
man, that's unfortunate that David

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.840
had to deal with all of that.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.119
I'm thankful that I get to read about it.

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:38.320
Why, because my heart's encouraged.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.760
When I read about what David dealt with in 1 Samuel 23,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.760
when I read about how God delivered his servant

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.320
that was surrounded by those that wanted to kill him

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.119
and God allowed for some other things to take place

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.840
so that Saul returns.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.619
And it's awesome to see our God at work.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.280
We find that the psalmist, as you study his life,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.220
you'll find that he's purposed in his praise.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.040
Look over at Psalm 108, if you will.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.919
Look at a few verses of scripture this morning

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:14.640
and look at the heart of the psalmist

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.160
and his praise, he's purposed.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.559
In Psalm 108, beginning in verse number one,

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:26.559
the Bible says this, Psalm 108 and verse number one,

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:30.640
oh God, my heart is fixed.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.640
I will sing and give praise even with my glory.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.000
Awake, psaltery and harp.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.200
I myself will awake early.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.160
I will praise thee, oh Lord, among the people

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.160
and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.400
Why, notice what he says in verse number four.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.200
For thy mercy is great above the heavens

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.940
and thy truth reacheth under the clouds.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.780
Our God is.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.020
He's merciful.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.260
Our God has given us truth.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.100
And here the psalmist, another psalm that's ascribed to David, he says that my heart is

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.960
fixed.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.180
He says that I will sing and give praise.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.900
He says, I will praise Thee, and I will praise Thee among the people, and I will sing praises

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.340
unto Thee among the nations.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.560
He's not fearful to praise God publicly, amen?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.260
By the way, we need to praise God publicly.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.080
Let people know how good our God is.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.780
Let people know what your God has done for you, and how He's saved you, and how He's

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.160
blessed you, and how He's worked in and through your life.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:46.160
We find that the psalmist's purpose, notice in Psalm 139, we're familiar with Psalm 139

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.960
in this portion of scripture, but we find that the psalmist says, when you think about

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:57.500
the, again, the intentional, the deliberate perspective of the psalmist with regard to

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:03.780
praise, notice what he says in Psalm 139 in verse number 14, I will praise Thee.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.780
Why?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:11.020
For I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are Thy works, and that my soul knoweth right

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.980
well.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.060
I will praise Thee.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060
I will praise Thee.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.180
You read Psalm 150.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.640
We won't take time to read it this morning, but if you read Psalm 150, you'll find that

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.000
the psalmist says, let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.520
Praise ye the Lord.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.280
And as you read, it's only six verses in Psalm 150, but as you read Psalm 150, you will find

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.800
that the psalmist is understanding that I'm going to praise God, first of all, for who

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.560
He is, and then I'm going to praise God for what He has done.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.060
Listen this morning, if we learn to praise God for who He is, we will never lack reason

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.540
to rejoice.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.780
Why?

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.860
Because He's immutable.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.740
He never changes.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.660
Your circumstances change.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.700
You might be on a mountaintop today.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.860
You might be in the valley today.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.700
Your circumstances are ever-changing, but God is consistent.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.560
God is constant.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.780
God is immutable.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.700
He is the same yesterday and today and forever, and we find that He is gracious and He is

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.880
merciful and He is loving toward us, and we think about all of His attributes, and we

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.800
think about learning to rejoice in who He is.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.000
He's good.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.120
We sang this morning, how great thou art, our God is great.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.480
This morning, we find that the psalmist, as we study, we read through the Psalms, we find

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.800
that He was purposed in His praise, and I, too, we, too, must be purposed in our praise.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.220
We must be deliberate.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.740
We must be intentional.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:50.240
We must make it a part of our lives, not just going through some rote religious activity,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.860
not just going through the motions, but purposefully every day.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.320
As the psalmist said in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath made.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:05.520
We will rejoice and be glad in it, but that guy cut me off, but I got, somebody said they

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520
got a flat tire.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520
I got this.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.520
I got that, but it's the day the Lord hath made, and I'm going to rejoice because God

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.800
has a plan and God has a purpose.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.860
Now, bear this with me.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.440
The psalmist, not only was he purposed in His praise, but number two, the psalmist was

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.120
persistent in his praise, persistent in his praise.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.120
I would say this.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.440
No matter the circumstances, no matter how I feel, no matter how you feel, no matter

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.360
what circumstances you deal with, you ought to praise God, amen?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.320
He's worthy of our praise, and the psalmist was persistent.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.180
David was persistent in his praise.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:44.620
We find that as we begin to look at the truth that God is good, He's good all of the time,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.500
and He's worthy of our praise, and we find that our circumstances I mentioned a moment

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:55.020
ago may change, but God never changes, and we find that we're to praise Him persistently.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.820
You know, there are times in our life when things seem to be going well, when things

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.500
seem to be on that mountaintop, so to speak, type of an experience, and it seems like it's

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.300
easy to praise God in those types of circumstances.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:14.300
When you're in the valley, it's a little bit more challenging, but we must be persistent

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:20.420
in our praise because God is good on the mountaintop, and God is good in the valley.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.920
You know what I've learned in life?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.540
Some of the hardest times in the valley end up being some of the sweetest times you'll

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.460
ever have with the Lord.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:38.020
You get to know God in a much more personal, intimate way when you're in the valley.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.020
You really do.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.060
You say, pastor, you're saying you want to be in the valley?

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.480
No.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.980
I'm just telling you by experience, the valley is a sweet place to be with the Lord, and

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:56.060
sometimes God will take us into the valley so that we can learn to trust Him, so we can

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.540
learn to depend on Him, so we can learn that He is who He says He is.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:07.900
You can't live life on the top of the mountain 24-7, 365.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.220
God took His servants into the storm.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.500
God will take us into storms, and you learn so much about Him.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.200
Psalm 52, remember the circumstances as you're turning to Psalm 52.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.160
Remember the circumstances, the setting for this particular psalm here in Psalm 54, the

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.320
setting of 1 Samuel 23.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.800
The men of Kelah that had just been delivered going to turn David over to Saul, Saul seeking

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.620
for him, the Ziphites saying, hey, we'll help you find him, and David says, I will.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.400
Praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.440
He's persistent in his praise.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.080
In Psalm 52, in verse number 9, the Bible says, I will praise thee.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.320
Notice what it says, forever, because thou hast done it, and I will wait on thy name

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.120
for it is good before thy saints.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.040
Notice that little phrase, forever.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.800
I will praise thee forever.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800
He's worthy.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.520
Listen, you understand in a real sense, when we think about the truth of forever, that

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.160
we will praise Him for all of eternity.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.200
You read the book of Revelation, you begin to see the throne room of heaven in Revelation

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:27.200
4 and 5 and see what's taking place, and you say, we will praise Him forever and ever.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200
But forever begins now.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.400
I'm going to praise Him persistently, perpetually.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.800
His praise shall be on my lips.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.400
He says, I will praise thee forever.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.560
Yeah, but David, your circumstances are going to change.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:45.720
Yes, but God doesn't, and I will praise Him forever, amen?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.880
He's persistent.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:55.360
Notice in Psalm 113, in verse number 3, look at a couple of other psalms here, but Psalm

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.200
113 and verse number 3, notice what the Bible says.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.200
I'll begin in verse number 1, as the psalmist is giving this instruction here, in verse

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.640
number 1 of Psalm 113, he says, praise ye the Lord, praise, O ye servants of the Lord,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.760
praise the name of the Lord.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.880
Seem like he wants us to praise Him, amen?

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.480
Verse 2, blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:27.040
Notice verse number 3, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.600
Lord's name is to be praised.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.360
Who's the one doing the praising?

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.400
The people of God, right?

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.520
And so, you notice, he says, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280
the Lord's name is to be praised.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.880
And, listen, don't be the naysayer and say, okay, so when the sun's not out, I don't have

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880
to praise Him.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.600
That's not what he's talking about, amen?

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.440
And we get the idea, as we look at the psalmist here, and we look at the truth of the Word

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.440
of God, that we're to be persistent in our praise.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.040
The psalmist said this, and you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 145, in verse

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.640
number 2, the Bible says, every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name forever

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.680
and ever.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.760
The next verse says, great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and His greatness is

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760
unsearchable.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.480
And the psalmist says, I will praise the Lord every day will I bless thee, and I will praise

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.040
thy name forever and ever.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.940
It's not only being purposed, but it's being persistent in our praise.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.920
It's understanding that every single day that God is the same, and that God has a plan and

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920
a purpose.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.880
And we find that as we look at the Word of God, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, the Bible

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.520
says, rejoice evermore.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.040
In Philippians chapter number 4, the Bible says, rejoice in the Lord always, and again

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.280
I say rejoice.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.440
We find that Paul was a man that God would use to pen those letters, those letters to

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.680
those churches about rejoicing, but Paul was a man that rejoiced.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.840
It's interesting as you read the letters that Paul writes under the inspiration of the Holy

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:06.200
Spirit of God, if you read the beginning section of each of those letters, you find very consistently

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.520
that Paul is praising God.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.480
Paul is being thankful.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.800
He's writing to the church in Corinth, by the way, not a model church, and he talks

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.480
in 1 Corinthians 1 about thanking God who is faithful.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.440
That's what he says.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440
God is faithful.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.480
I've got to deal with a whole lot of nonsense in the church in Corinth, and he's going to

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.920
give it to them in the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.040
There's correction that is needed, but he begins by saying, I'm praising God because

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.280
He's faithful.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.360
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.600
All our God is faithful.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.640
We must be purposed in our praise, just as the psalmist was.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.920
We must be persistent in our praise, just as the psalmist was, and I will say this,

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.840
we must be passionate in our praise, just as the psalmist was.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.680
The psalmist was passionate in his praise.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.880
Notice what he says in Psalm 9 in verse number 1.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.800
I love the phraseology here,

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.960
and it's certainly convicting.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.680
As we begin to see what's taking place,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.760
and we find that the psalmist is revealing to us

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.960
this passion in which he would praise the Lord.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.840
In fact, as you study the life of David,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.880
and you see what's taking place in his life,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.160
and you begin to look at various aspects of his life,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.760
as you read the book of 1 Samuel,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.240
you see a man that passionately prays God.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.080
Amen?

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.600
I mean, he's passionate about it.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.800
Do you remember the scene when they're bringing

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.160
the ark back to Jerusalem?

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.720
I mean, there is rejoicing that is taking place.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.580
I mean, it is a big deal, and there is passionate praise.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.760
We find that the psalmist said this in Psalm 9,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.940
in verse number one, I will praise thee, O Lord,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.940
notice what it says, with my whole heart.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.360
I will show forth all thy marvelous works.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.180
My whole heart.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.240
It's passionate.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.580
It's not half-hearted praise.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.940
It's not praising God because someone's making me

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.180
praise God, it's praising him because he's worthy

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.540
of my praise, and he deserves our praise,

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.180
and he's been so abundantly good to us,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.340
and I'm gonna praise him with my whole heart.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.140
You say, but other people are gonna say.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.980
Doesn't matter.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.660
You watch sporting events.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.260
Those people go crazy for some sports team

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.340
because they won some game.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.180
That in the light of eternity isn't gonna matter at all.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.540
I remember sitting in a church in England five years ago,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.560
and the setting in England is different than it is here.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.520
In fact, as you go to churches in America,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.260
you find that there's different settings, even America.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.100
We're kind of in a little bit of an in-between,

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.600
but man, if you go down south, man,

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.020
they're shouting and praising God and amen

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.260
as you're preaching, and they're preaching from the pew

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.540
as you're preaching from the pulpit.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.160
I mean, they're excited about praising God, amen.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.240
You get up into New England, and it's very proper,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.540
and very, we're somewhere in the middle,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.779
but over in England, I mean, it was just extremely formal

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:17.300
and just very different.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.059
I remember standing up to sing,

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:21.980
and we stood up to sing that first song,

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.660
and we had the hymnal, and man, I don't sing on tune,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.620
but I sing loud, man.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.700
God said, make a joyful noise unto the Lord,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.520
and I stood up to sing, and it was like

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.100
I was the only one singing in the place.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.240
I was like, whoa, I gotta lower it down a little bit, right?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.100
And it was just the way it was.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.460
And I remember talking to our missionary, Jared Clement,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.220
and I said something to him about, we're just talking.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.180
I wasn't criticizing.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.460
I was just inquiring, and he said, well, you know,

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.419
they're just, the English people,

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:48.940
they're just not very passionate, and so on and so forth.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.260
I was like, I've seen clips of them watching football,

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.260
soccer, those guys are nuts, right?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.120
Listen, we ought to be passionate for our God, amen,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.460
with my whole heart.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.620
I'm not saying be fleshly, be carnal.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.660
I'm not saying hang from rafters and crazy stuff,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.380
but I'm saying it ought to be a wholehearted worship.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.880
The psalmist says, I will praise thee,

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:20.279
but he says, with my whole heart.

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:23.880
In Psalm 86, in verse number 12, the psalmist says this,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.419
and again, just being consistent with this thought

00:33:26.419 --> 00:33:30.440
of being passionate, he says,

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.120
I will praise thee, O Lord, my God, with all my heart,

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.160
and I will glorify thy name forevermore.

00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:40.660
Some of you would know the name of Matthew Henry.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.360
He's a theologian of yesteryear that God used

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.000
to write a commentary series.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.840
I very rarely look at Matthew Henry's commentary.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.720
Some people have it, I have a copy of it.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.300
I very rarely use, I don't use commentaries a ton,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.160
but there's an account in the life of Matthew Henry

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.120
that some of you may be familiar with,

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:06.040
and it goes well with this thought

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.840
of I will praise thy name.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.880
I will praise him, I'll be purposed,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.520
just as the psalmist was.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.000
I will be persistent, I will be passionate.

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:19.399
The account goes like this,

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:22.559
that Matthew Henry, one day, he was robbed.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.959
A man came and pulled a weapon on him

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:29.640
and robbed him of his wallet.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.440
It was a very unfortunate situation,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.119
but Matthew Henry went home

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.720
and began to journal about that situation,

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:41.520
and he had determined in his heart

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.440
that he was gonna praise God.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.880
Prior to this event ever happening,

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.600
he had purposed, I'm gonna praise God,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.959
just as we preach this morning,

00:34:49.959 --> 00:34:52.360
just as we look at the example of the psalmist.

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:57.619
He began to write, and it's said that in this account

00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:01.440
that he writes, I'm thankful that I was the one

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.600
that was robbed and not the one doing the robbing.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.040
Hmm.

00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:12.360
Okay.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.640
He says, I'm thankful, listen to this,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.980
I'm thankful that they took everything I have,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.339
but it wasn't much.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.920
I'm thankful that they just robbed me and didn't kill me.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.440
Yeah.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.000
There were other things on his list,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.220
but those are the three that I'll share with you.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.559
And I want you to think about that perspective.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:47.899
We read of David and his praise.

00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:51.399
We see the event in 1 Samuel 23.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.440
We read of Paul and of his praise,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.279
even in Acts 16, when they're beaten and imprisoned

00:35:57.279 --> 00:35:58.679
and they're praising God.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.119
We see a man named Matthew Henry

00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:06.160
that was robbed one day.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.119
I've never been robbed.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.720
I hope to never be robbed.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.959
But if I'd be honest with you this morning,

00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:15.559
and if you'd be honest with me this morning,

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:16.880
if you were robbed on the way here,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.000
that probably would not be the first three things

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
out of your mouth, and probably wouldn't be

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.200
the first three things out of my mouth.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.959
Can we be transparent this morning?

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.959
But we need to get to the place where the psalmist is.

00:36:32.959 --> 00:36:35.600
See, I'm gonna be purposed in my praise.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.279
I'm gonna be intentional and deliberate about praising God,

00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:41.160
because God is good.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.959
I'm gonna be persistent, no matter the circumstances,

00:36:45.959 --> 00:36:48.640
no matter what's going on, from the rising of the sun

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.080
to the going down of the same.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.559
I'm gonna praise his name from this day forth and forever.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:55.619
I'm going to praise my God.

00:36:56.619 --> 00:36:58.619
And I'm gonna be passionate about it.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.899
With my whole heart, I'm gonna praise him.

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:04.459
See, whether you're on the mountaintop

00:37:04.459 --> 00:37:07.459
or you're in the valley, God wants to hear your praise.

00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:09.660
Someone wrote the song years ago,

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.700
God Wants to Hear You Sing, and he does.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.820
He wants to hear your praise, and he's worthy of it.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.179
And oh, that God would help us this morning.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.580
I said it in Sunday school to close the Sunday school hour.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.399
As God's people, we don't need a federal holiday

00:37:27.399 --> 00:37:28.820
to cause us to be thankful.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:35.980
I am thankful that we have a federal holiday on our calendar

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.820
that causes us to be more aware of

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:45.140
and focused on at this time of year.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.059
I'm thankful for that.

00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:50.200
But the reality is that every single day,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.399
we ought to be thanking God.

00:37:53.399 --> 00:37:55.959
Oh, that God would help us to not be caught up

00:37:55.959 --> 00:38:00.200
in the culture and the society of being an unthankful people

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.399
or a complaining people,

00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:04.200
but that God would help us to praise his name.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.040
Let's pray together.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040
Father, we love you.

00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:08.760
How we thank you for loving us.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.320
We thank you for the word of God.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.399
We thank you for the truth contained therein.

00:38:12.399 --> 00:38:14.980
We thank you for the example of the psalmist.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.140
And Lord, as we look at the example of the psalmist,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.600
we are challenged.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.179
I pray that you would help each of us, Lord,

00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:29.380
to be purposed, to be persistent,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.940
to be passionate in our praise of thee.

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:37.179
Lord, perhaps there's one here that's not sure of heaven.

00:38:38.619 --> 00:38:40.739
They've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:41.919
as their personal savior.

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:42.960
If they were to die today,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.660
they do not have assurance that heaven is their home.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.619
Oh God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God

00:38:48.979 --> 00:38:50.739
would speak to the heart of that individual

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:54.059
and help them to understand their need for Christ.

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:57.419
I pray they'd understand that, God, you love them.

00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:58.900
You sent your son to die for them.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.700
He suffered, bled and died.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.380
He was buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.700
but he rose conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.260
He's alive forevermore.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.460
And he is the savior of the world.

00:39:13.539 --> 00:39:15.080
God, if there's one in that condition

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.919
that needs to be saved,

00:39:15.919 --> 00:39:18.419
I pray that you would give us an opportunity

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.059
to take a Bible and show them

00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:22.739
how they could know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:25.099
Lord, I pray for Christians this morning

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:26.580
that are gathered together.

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:31.039
Oh God, I pray that you'd help us in this area of our praise.

00:39:32.179 --> 00:39:36.299
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to respond now

00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:37.539
to that which we have heard.

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:41.260
I pray that you'd move, work as only you can.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.020
We'll thank you for every decision that's made

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.419
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:45.619
Would you stand with me?
