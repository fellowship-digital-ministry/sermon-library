1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
All right, we're having our midweek service.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,640
We're pre recording it again, like we did last week.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,960
And I'll be emailing out a link on YouTube for you to be able to watch the service we're

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,879
pre recording so that the rest of the week, we will not be in the church building, and

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,139
other folks will be able to come in and take care of things because of the quarantine protocol.

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:27,479
But certainly thankful for technology that we're able to do this thankful for Holly and

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:32,180
the kiddos helping out with all the aspects of the service, we do trust it to be a blessing

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,340
to you.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,340
And we're going to sing a couple of songs.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,540
The first one is this God will take care of you.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,500
And it's number 579 in our hymnal God will take care of you

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:57,360
God will take care of you

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,360
God will take care of you

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,360
God will take care of you

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
God will take care of you

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,220
God will take care of you

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,220
Through every day or all the way

18
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,220
He will take care of you

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:40,220
God will take care of you

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Through days of toil and hardships

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,080
God will take care of you

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,080
When dangers reach your path of sin

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,080
God will take care of you

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,940
God will take care of you

25
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Through every day or all the way

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,940
He will take care of you

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,940
God will take care of you

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,800
All you may need He will provide

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,800
God will take care of you

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Nothing you ask will be denied

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,800
God will take care of you

32
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,660
God will take care of you

33
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Through every day or all the way

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,660
He will take care of you

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,660
God will take care of you

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,520
No matter what may be the test

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,520
God will take care of you

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,520
When weary or hung upon His breast

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,520
God will take care of you

40
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,380
God will take care of you

41
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,380
Through every day or all the way

42
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,380
He will take care of you

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:11,380
God will take care of you

44
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,239
God will take care of you

45
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,239
Through every day or all the way

46
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:30,239
He will take care of you

47
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:36,239
God will take care of you

48
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Thank you for the opportunity to have that calm rest and assurance that God will take care of you.

49
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,100
He is able and what a blessing and so thankful for the opportunity to have service

50
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,100
And thankful for just the blessings that God has bestowed upon us individually and corporately.

51
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Let's go to the Lord in prayer.

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Father, we do love you and we thank you for loving us.

53
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,100
We thank you for the privilege of being able to worship you.

54
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,959
We thank you for the work that you did in our hearts and lives on Sunday.

55
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,959
And God, we pray that as we once again open your word today, Lord, I pray that you would challenge us and convict us and comfort us.

56
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,959
I pray, God, that you'd help each one to be attentive and responsive.

57
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,959
I pray, God, that the word of God would minister to our hearts.

58
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,959
We thank you for this hymn, Lord, this song that had been written many years ago

59
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,820
that even still ministers to the hearts of your people today.

60
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,820
And God, I pray that you would help us to rest in the truth of what the songwriter was writing about.

61
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Lord, we thank you for the promise in the book of 1 Peter in the 5th chapter

62
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,820
that we can cast all our care upon you knowing that you care for us

63
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:58,820
and what great comfort that is and what great joy, peace, and rest it brings to our hearts.

64
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,679
We do pray that you'd watch over those that are dealing with health issues.

65
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,679
We pray, God, that you'd touch bodies, give healing.

66
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:11,679
We pray, God, that you would be exalted and magnified through all that's said and done throughout this service.

67
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,679
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

68
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:17,679
I do want to encourage you to continue to pray, if you will, for the Peterson family

69
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,679
and for Virginia and Yolanda and also for the Cooks and the Currys.

70
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:25,679
And if you would, continue to pray for Brother Ronnie Hall.

71
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,540
He, of course, has been dealing with back and hip trouble

72
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,540
and it's been extremely painful for him at times and he's seeming to improve some.

73
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,540
And so if you would continue to pray for Brother Ronnie, I know that he'd appreciate that.

74
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,540
And then if you'd pray for Brother Manuel, he is scheduled to have surgery next week.

75
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,540
And so we're praying that he'll receive this week all of the clearances from the doctors

76
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,540
that he needs to receive in order to go forward to have the surgery.

77
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,399
And that's going to be just a very, we're praying, a very successful shoulder surgery.

78
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,399
Obviously, there'll be some time of rehab and all that sort of thing.

79
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,399
And so we'll need to be praying for Brother Manuel for several weeks now

80
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,399
with regard to all of those things.

81
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,399
But we are trusting that it will give him relief from the pain in which he's been dealing with

82
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,399
and give him more mobility.

83
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,399
And I know that the Fesdechian family greatly appreciates your prayers.

84
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,459
I do want to encourage you to pray for some of our missionaries and then also some church planters.

85
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,459
And I know that I've shared with you over the last several months about a couple of church planters.

86
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,459
One of them is Brother Ben Webster at Newport News Baptist Church.

87
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,459
And they are still looking to be able to get into their own property.

88
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,459
And they've had a few obstacles that have come in their way.

89
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,459
But God is greater and God is able.

90
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,519
And so if you would pray for wisdom and direction for the Newport News Baptist Church

91
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,519
and Brother Ben Webster and the church family there that God would give clarity

92
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,519
with regard to the decisions that need to be made.

93
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,519
And that he would open up the doors and make things clear to them.

94
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,519
I know they'd appreciate that.

95
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,519
And then there's a new church planter that I have just recently been made aware of

96
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,519
and had the opportunity of meeting.

97
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,519
And his name is Brother Zach Hauser.

98
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,519
And he's planted a church up in Delaware.

99
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,579
And God is working and God is moving.

100
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,579
And we're very thankful.

101
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,579
It's exciting to hear about churches that are being established in our region.

102
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,579
And then also, of course, around the globe.

103
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,579
Please do continue to pray for the Savali family and the situation there in Samoa

104
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,579
with their church plant.

105
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,580
And I hope to be able to get some information from Brother Savali here this week

106
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,580
with regard to the meeting with the tribal leaders and the Mamali and all of that

107
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,580
that needs to take place.

108
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
But I know that he greatly appreciates your prayers.

109
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Do pray, if you will, for Brother Paul Mershon.

110
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,640
I mentioned last year a number of meetings have been canceled.

111
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
And this is continuing.

112
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Of course, they're based out in California.

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,640
They continue to have more and more travel bans and restrictions

114
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,640
and various things going on there in the state of California.

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,640
And so if you'd pray for Brother Mershon and his wife, Linda,

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,700
that God would just give them wisdom and direction with regard to their meeting schedule.

117
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
I know they'd greatly appreciate that.

118
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,700
And then also pray for Brother Hummel and Beacon of Truth.

119
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
And I spoke with Brother Hummel just the other day.

120
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
And they're doing well.

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
They had an assembly to start the year.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
It was a Saturday assembly.

123
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,700
And then had church with that congregation on Sunday.

124
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
And a brand-new church, brand-new.

125
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Actually, the church itself is only about two years old.

126
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,760
And it was their first time of having a scripture assembly.

127
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
And so that was exciting news to hear about a brand-new church

128
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
that's getting involved with the ministry.

129
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
And they had their first assembly.

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
And they enjoyed it so much that they said it's something that they want to do regularly,

131
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
such as what we have done.

132
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
And they're inquiring about purchasing staplers

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
and being able to get all of the supplies

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
and things that they need to do on a regular basis.

135
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
And so that was encouraging to me.

136
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Obviously, very encouraging to Brother Hummel.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,940
And so if you would pray for the Beacon of Truth Baptist Ministries, they have had some

138
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,860
meetings canceled that they had scheduled here in the first quarter of 2021.

139
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,100
So if you would pray for wisdom and then also they're seeking to get that facility completed

140
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
up in Bedford.

141
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,220
I know that Brother Hummel shared some things with you all when he was here back in December

142
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,400
and they are moving forward.

143
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,820
He was sharing with me kind of the timeline on some of the additional things that need

144
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
to be done.

145
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,540
But it's very exciting to hear about the work that's being done and the progress that's

146
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,780
taking place and looking forward to being able to hear about the completion of that

147
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,500
project and being able to schedule our first trip to go up to Bedford to put scriptures

148
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,660
together and to be a blessing and a help to the Beacon of Truth Baptist Ministries to

149
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,060
get the word of God around the world.

150
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,380
Continue to pray for the parsonage and the project is completing.

151
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,040
In fact, as we're recording here, this message, the men are out there working and they are

152
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,360
making good progress.

153
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,040
The trusses, it's my understanding, will be installed tomorrow and looking forward to

154
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,840
being able to see the structure just making more and more progress day by day.

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,600
And so thank you for your prayers for that project.

156
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,560
Let's go to the Lord in prayer as we'll have a time of offering and I do thank you for

157
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
your faithfulness and giving what a privilege it is to give to the Lord.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And let's pray.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
Father, we thank you for the privilege of giving.

160
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,740
We thank you for the faithfulness of your people and Lord, we thank you and acknowledge

161
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,300
the plan that you have for the financing of the local church through the people of God.

162
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,160
And I pray that you'd help us to give cheerfully and appropriately, that you'd bless the gift

163
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
and giver.

164
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,780
Lord, that you'd use the funds for the furtherance of the ministry here and around the world.

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,020
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

166
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,820
All right, we're going to sing our theme song, Complete in Thee.

167
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Let's sing, All Your Anxiety.

168
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Is there a heart, Lord, bound by sorrow?

169
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Is there a life weighed down by care?

170
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Come to the cross, each burden bearing.

171
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,820
All your anxiety, leave it there.

172
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,820
All your anxiety, all your care.

173
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

174
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

175
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Never a friend like Jesus.

176
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,820
No other friend so keen to help you.

177
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,820
No other friend so quick to hear.

178
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,820
No other place to leave your burden.

179
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,820
No other one to hear your prayer.

180
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,820
All your anxiety, all your care.

181
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

182
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

183
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Never a friend like Jesus.

184
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Come and at once, delay no longer.

185
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,820
He is entreaty, kind and sweet.

186
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,820
You need not fear a disappointment.

187
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,820
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.

188
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,820
All your anxiety, all your care.

189
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

190
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

191
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Never a friend like Jesus.

192
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Well, amen.

193
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Both of those hymns were greatly encouraging to my heart today,

194
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
and I hope to yours as well.

195
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,820
And what a blessing to know that we can.

196
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,820
We have someone, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

197
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,820
that we can take our burdens to and leave them with him.

198
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,820
You know, we're living in the midst of great anxiety.

199
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,820
We see, we hear of reports all around us of those that are dealing with anxiety,

200
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,820
and they're anxious over the things that are taking place in our world.

201
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
They're anxious for many reasons.

202
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,820
And I'm thankful as a child of God that though we're in the world, we're not of the world.

203
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,820
And I'm thankful that when the world seems as if it's falling apart,

204
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
that we can have that peace that passeth all understanding,

205
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
that we can rest in him knowing that he cares for us,

206
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
that we can take our anxiety, our cares,

207
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
and take it to the mercy seat and leave it there,

208
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
knowing that he is able to help.

209
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I'm so thankful that the Bible teaches us

210
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
that our God is a very present help in the time of trouble.

211
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
He is our helper.

212
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
There are times in which maybe all we can do is say as the psalmist said,

213
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Help, Lord!

214
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
And I'm thankful that he is able to help.

215
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
He's ready to help.

216
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
He is the creator of all things.

217
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
He spoke it all into existence.

218
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,820
He sustains it all by his own power.

219
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
And he's my God, my Savior.

220
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
What a blessing.

221
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Romans chapter number 1 is where we'll be for our study here this evening.

222
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,820
I love to tell the story.

223
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
It will be the title of the message today.

224
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
And Romans chapter number 1.

225
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,820
And as we begin to kind of think of where we are with regard to our study here,

226
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,820
this is a doctrinal study that has been kind of a side study of the book of Titus.

227
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,820
We started a study in our adult Sunday school class through the book of Titus a number of months ago.

228
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Actually, it's almost been a year ago,

229
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,820
but that was suspended for a period of time as we did not have Sunday school with the pandemic and what have you.

230
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
And then when we resumed our student ministries,

231
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,820
we returned to our study with here in the sanctuary on the book of Titus.

232
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,820
And Titus chapter 2 and verse number 1 says,

233
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,820
but speak now the things which become sound doctrine.

234
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
We understand the importance of doctrine.

235
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
We understand the source of doctrine.

236
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,820
And we've taken for now a number of weeks and looked at some doctrinal things.

237
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:02,820
In fact, we've been dealing with the doctrine of Christ and where we started our study on the doctrine of Christ was in Matthew chapter number 16.

238
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
It was in that passage of Scripture in which the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to his disciples.

239
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
He says, whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

240
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,820
And he asked that question, what a very important question, a pertinent question, no doubt.

241
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,820
We find that as they would hear the question and then give response that in their response,

242
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,820
it reveals to us that there was a level of confusion amongst the people in the day of Jesus's time.

243
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
We find that he had walked upon the earth.

244
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
His earthly ministry was moving forward.

245
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,820
And there were many that knew about Jesus.

246
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,820
They knew of the miracles that he had performed.

247
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
They heard about Jesus.

248
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,820
But unfortunately, there was some confusion with regard to who he is.

249
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,820
When he asked the question to the disciples, they say, well, some say that you're John the Baptist.

250
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,820
Some say that you're Jeremiah, Isaiah, one of the prophets, so on and so forth.

251
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,880
And through their response, we've noted and we've dealt with the confusion.

252
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,620
I've said this, that that same level of confusion exists today.

253
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,120
The question that Jesus asked to His disciples nearly 2,000 years ago is a question that

254
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,440
still needs to be asked today.

255
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,240
Who is Jesus?

256
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,300
Who is He?

257
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,860
Today the answers may vary from the answers that were given by the disciples on that particular

258
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,900
day.

259
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,340
And there would be some that would say, well, He's a teacher.

260
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,540
He's a prophet.

261
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,380
He's a good man.

262
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,540
There are various answers that may be provided.

263
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:52,180
But I'm thankful for what Peter stood and proclaimed, thou art the Christ, the Son of

264
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,820
the living God.

265
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,380
Why did Peter proclaim that?

266
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,260
Well, because Jesus said, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

267
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,780
And he received their answer and understood the confusion of the people.

268
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,540
But then he says, but whom say ye that I am?

269
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:15,380
And Peter proclaimed with confidence and courage that Jesus is the Messiah, the anointed one,

270
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,660
the promised one.

271
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,360
And what a joy it is to know Him.

272
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,800
What a privilege it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ, that He is God in flesh, that He is

273
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
my Savior.

274
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:37,860
We went and spent several weeks dealing with the subject matter from the song, Jesus is

275
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,040
all the world to me.

276
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,440
We asked the question, would you say that Jesus is all the world to you?

277
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,720
If you would, and someone were to say why, what would your answers be?

278
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,040
In no way was our study exhaustive.

279
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,680
We simply looked at a few reasons from the Word of God as to why we might say that Jesus

280
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,880
is all the world to me, because of who He is, because of His mighty power, because of

281
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,240
His death, burial, and resurrection, because of His work today, and because He's coming

282
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
back for me.

283
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,880
Oh, those are just a few reasons as to why Jesus is all the world to me.

284
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,400
But as we continue with the thought of the doctrine of Christ and understanding that

285
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,280
we as saved people would stand and proclaim that Jesus is all the world to me, that we

286
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:36,680
would know and could answer the question appropriately as Peter did, that we know that He, Jesus,

287
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,400
is the Christ, the Son of the living God, He's God in flesh.

288
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,040
There is a world of people that do not know who Jesus is.

289
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,560
They don't know Him.

290
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,720
Some know about Him.

291
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,040
Unfortunately, as we move further and further away from the truth of the Word of God, as

292
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:06,080
our society seeks to stamp out any references to God or Christianity, there are a number

293
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,120
of young people that they have no idea even about Jesus.

294
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,640
Thus, I love to tell the story.

295
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,160
It's a song that's very familiar to most of us.

296
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,240
In fact, we had the privilege of singing this song on Sunday.

297
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:39,080
And I just want to read one verse of the song as we get into the lesson.

298
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,120
It's verse number three where the Bible says,

299
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I love to tell the story, tis pleasant to repeat.

300
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,840
What seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet.

301
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,040
I wonder if that's true for us.

302
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:07,960
Each time you tell the story of Jesus and His love, does it grow sweeter and sweeter?

303
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,280
You recognize what He did for you, how He saved your soul.

304
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:21,720
It continues, I love to tell the story, for some have never heard.

305
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:31,320
The message of salvation from God's own Holy Word.

306
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:38,279
I do not seek to correct the songwriter, but I would say that when it says for some have

307
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,960
never heard, it's probably more accurate to say many have never heard.

308
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,440
There are many in our world today that have never heard the message of salvation from

309
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
God's own Holy Word.

310
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,800
Therefore, we sing as the redeemed of the Lord, I love to tell the story.

311
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,320
And I wonder, do you love to tell the story?

312
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,960
If you love to tell the story, that would mean that you're telling the story.

313
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,480
Amen?

314
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:20,119
It's not fair for me or for any one of us to say I love to tell the story or to sing

315
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:26,399
I love to tell the story, and yet never tell the story.

316
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:34,940
That would be hypocrisy, but the reality is that we ought to love to tell the story because

317
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,679
it did so much for me, as the songwriter said in another one of the verses.

318
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,839
That story is the story of salvation, of Jesus and His love.

319
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,200
Notice with me in Romans chapter number one, we'll look at three verses of Scripture, verse

320
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,559
14, 15, and 16, and I will let you know it's in Bible study, so we'll be in a number of

321
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,679
different passages of Scripture, so get your fingers ready.

322
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,720
And as we look through these three verses, really they'll be used as our points for our

323
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,040
outline and our message this evening.

324
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,000
The Bible says this, Paul is speaking, it says in verse number 14, I am debtor both

325
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,399
to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

326
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:30,279
So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

327
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:38,860
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation,

328
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:46,160
to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

329
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,040
As we look at this passage of Scripture and use it as our basis for our outline in this

330
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,460
study, I love to tell the story.

331
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,860
I would say this, number one, we should recognize the privilege.

332
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,300
You know, it is a unique privilege that we have as the people of God to repeat the story,

333
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,679
the gospel of Jesus Christ.

334
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,679
What a unique privilege.

335
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I understand it's a responsibility, and we must not forget that it is a responsibility.

336
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:26,700
It is a responsibility for every child of God to give the gospel.

337
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,500
The great commission, as I said on Sunday morning, is our mission.

338
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,580
The great commission is that we would go into the world and preach the gospel to every creature,

339
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,399
and that responsibility is laid upon every single person that has been born again.

340
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,399
It's our duty.

341
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,520
It's our responsibility.

342
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,520
But I would say as we consider the subject matter and think about this song, I love to

343
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:01,119
tell the story, could I help you and help myself understand that it is a privilege,

344
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:08,500
and we need to recognize the privilege that God would give us to be the bearers of good

345
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:20,179
news, that God would use us to be the servants, the individuals to proclaim the gospel message.

346
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:22,260
Think about those shepherds.

347
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,339
I preached about them back in December.

348
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:30,640
Those shepherds, we examined the passage of Scripture, and we observed some things

349
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,520
about those shepherds, and they received that message unto you.

350
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,559
There was some good news of glad tidings, and that message was given to them, but it

351
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,520
was to be to all people.

352
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:56,979
What a privilege was theirs to go and share with others the message that they had received.

353
00:28:56,979 --> 00:29:05,260
And we note that in verse number 14 of Romans 1, Paul says, notice what he says, I am debtor

354
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,700
both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

355
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,400
See, we need to recognize the privilege that is ours to tell the story.

356
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,919
I want you to remember of what the disciples said, turn back to the book of Acts, if you

357
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,280
will, in chapter number 5.

358
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:29,679
In Acts chapter number 5, early on in the advancement of the gospel in Jerusalem, many

359
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,080
wonderful things are taking place, but there's opposition, persecution, threats, beatings,

360
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,200
all sorts of things, imprisonment, all these things going on.

361
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,359
But I want you to notice and remember what the disciples say.

362
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,760
In Acts chapter number 5, in verse number 28, the accusers, the opposition, they said

363
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,760
this to the disciples, did not, we straightly command you that you should not teach in this

364
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
name.

365
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
And behold, ye have failed.

366
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,280
You filled Jerusalem with Your doctrine

367
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,160
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

368
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,540
Oh, that it would be said that we filled

369
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,240
our Jerusalem with the teaching of Jesus Christ,

370
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,700
with the Gospel.

371
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, what a blessing I'm told

372
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,480
of a church in California

373
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,720
that is so consistent on getting into their community

374
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,000
to preach the Gospel and to share the Gospel

375
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,240
with their community.

376
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,280
They have a purpose and a plan,

377
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
a strategy if you will,

378
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,040
to reach their community.

379
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,200
And they've been so committed and so faithful

380
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,440
that there are people within the community

381
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,800
that have made signs and put on their doors,

382
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,400
if you're from such-and-such a Baptist church,

383
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,600
we're not interested.

384
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,560
I like it.

385
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,440
I don't like that the people aren't interested.

386
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
But what I like is that the church

387
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,680
has taken the responsibility

388
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,600
and the privilege of going with a system

389
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,920
and with a plan

390
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,240
and strategically going to reach their community.

391
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,040
What a blessing.

392
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,840
It says in v. 29 of Acts 5,

393
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,680
then Peter and the other apostles answered and said,

394
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,360
we ought to obey God rather than men.

395
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,520
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus

396
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,360
from Yisra'el and hanged on a tree.

397
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,280
Him hath God exalted with His right hand

398
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,800
to be a Prince and a Savior

399
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
for to give repentance to Israel

400
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,160
and forgiveness of sins.

401
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:43,160
And v. 32, we are His witnesses of these things.

402
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,200
We're His witnesses.

403
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
They were eyewitnesses.

404
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
They were the witnesses

405
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,720
and we are witnesses.

406
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,120
And what a privilege to be a witness

407
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,080
to go and to proclaim the message,

408
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,800
the story, the greatest story ever told.

409
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,240
The story of Jesus and His love.

410
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,040
The story of redemption

411
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,160
through the blood of Christ.

412
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,840
And we're privileged to be able to take that message.

413
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,320
Paul says to the believers in 2 Corinthians 5

414
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,640
that we're ambassadors.

415
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,040
You know, to be an ambassador is a privileged position.

416
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,000
And as the children of God,

417
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
God calls us as His people

418
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,120
because we are ambassadors.

419
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,200
We understand that our citizenship is in heaven.

420
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger.

421
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

422
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,600
This world is not my home,

423
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
as the songwriter said.

424
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,720
Jesus said that we're in the world,

425
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,120
but we're not of the world.

426
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,800
And we understand that we are ambassadors.

427
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,200
We've been entrusted with a responsibility

428
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,240
and it is a privilege

429
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,520
to represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

430
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,920
Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9.

431
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,000
You'll notice two statements of Paul.

432
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,360
One here in 1 Corinthians

433
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,000
and then another over in 1 Thessalonians.

434
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,880
But notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9

435
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,280
when we consider and recognize the privilege.

436
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,920
I love to tell the story.

437
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,480
It is a privilege to tell the story.

438
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,360
To proclaim the Gospel.

439
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,040
That God would use us.

440
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,760
Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 9

441
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,240
verse 16 and 17,

442
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
"'For though I preach the Gospel,

443
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,080
I have nothing to glory of,

444
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,840
for necessity is laid upon me.

445
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,360
Yea, woe is unto me

446
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,360
if I preach not the Gospel.

447
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,040
For if I do this thing willingly,

448
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,000
I have a reward.

449
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,280
But if against my will,

450
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,320
a dispensation of the Gospel

451
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,360
is committed unto me.'"

452
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,040
Paul says,

453
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,320
"'Woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel.'"

454
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,760
He says,

455
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,000
"'If I do this thing willingly,

456
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,840
I have a reward.'"

457
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,400
It's a privilege to take the Gospel.

458
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,640
We notice what Paul says

459
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,440
in 1 Thessalonians 2.

460
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,520
Take and turn over that passage if you will.

461
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,680
Paul had the privilege of going

462
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,920
into the town of Thessalonica

463
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,800
and delivering the Gospel.

464
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
Seeing a church established.

465
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,760
Best we can tell,

466
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,360
he was not there for any lengthy period of time.

467
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,119
He spent a significant amount of time

468
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,880
in Ephesus and in Corinth,

469
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,080
but in Thessalonica,

470
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,880
he was not able to spend much time there

471
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,960
because of the opposition.

472
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,559
But I want you to notice what he says.

473
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,920
And focus upon the verbage,

474
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,680
the terminology that Paul uses

475
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,360
when he's speaking to these individuals

476
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,520
in verse 1 of chapter 2.

477
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,920
It says,

478
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,440
"'For yourselves, brethren,

479
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,800
know our entrance in unto you

480
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,320
that it was not in vain.'"

481
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,520
By the way,

482
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,080
if we consider that last phrase

483
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,760
of verse 1,

484
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,839
and we couple it with 1 Corinthians 15

485
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,119
and verse 58,

486
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,040
our work is not in vain in the Lord.

487
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,160
Amen?

488
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,559
He says,

489
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,040
"'Our entrance in unto you

490
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,920
that it was not in vain.'"

491
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,839
Listen, there are times

492
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,640
in which you might take the Gospel to somebody

493
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,080
and you think,

494
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,279
man, they weren't interested.

495
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:10,960
And you walk away perhaps discouraged,

496
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,360
but you have to understand

497
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
that as Paul said to the believers in Corinth,

498
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,480
that some plant some water,

499
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,040
but God gives the increase.

500
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,600
The Holy Spirit of God

501
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,000
is able to use the Word of God

502
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,640
and work in the heart of the individual.

503
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:24,960
He says,

504
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,720
"'It was not in vain.'"

505
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,160
Verse 2,

506
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,760
"'But even after that we had suffered before

507
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,279
and were shamefully entreated,

508
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,559
as you know, at Philippi,

509
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,600
we were bold in our God

510
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
to speak unto you

511
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,200
the Gospel of God with much contention.'"

512
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,600
And so they had boldness

513
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,880
in spite of this continued persecution

514
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,080
that they were dealing with.

515
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,600
If you go back to the book of Acts

516
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,839
and you read in Acts 16 and 17

517
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,600
and read all that was taking place

518
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,119
in Philippi and Thessalonica

519
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,040
as he references those two places

520
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
in particular here in these verses of Scripture,

521
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
you find that he says

522
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,040
that even in light of those things,

523
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,480
we were bold in our God.

524
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,559
Now that's important for us to understand.

525
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,000
We go in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

526
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
It's Jesus Christ that gave the commission

527
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,760
and said, I will be with you.

528
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,119
It says this in verse 3,

529
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,040
"'For our exhortation was not of deceit

530
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.'"

531
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
Notice this phrase,

532
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,760
"'But,' in verse 4,

533
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,480
"'as we were allowed of God

534
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,600
to be put in trust with the Gospel,

535
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,160
even so we speak,

536
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,320
not as pleasing men,

537
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,119
but God which trieth our hearts.'"

538
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,119
You notice what he says

539
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,160
in the beginning of verse 4,

540
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,080
"'But as we were allowed of God

541
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,960
to be put in trust with the Gospel.'"

542
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,880
You understand that God has allowed us

543
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,600
to be put in trust with the Gospel?

544
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
The church, as Paul is writing to Timothy,

545
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,559
is the pillar and ground of the truth.

546
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,760
And as individual believers,

547
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,160
we've been allowed of God.

548
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,200
He's given us this privilege.

549
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,480
Paul says, I am debtor.

550
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
I am privileged.

551
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
When I think about the song,

552
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,920
when I think about the question

553
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,279
that Jesus asked

554
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,880
and the confusion that existed

555
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,080
in the day of Christ,

556
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,279
and I think about the world

557
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,640
in which we currently live

558
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,600
and the confusion that exists

559
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,080
with regard to the question,

560
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,200
who is Jesus?

561
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,080
I'm mindful of the fact that God

562
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,119
has given us the privilege

563
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,559
of not only knowing Him,

564
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,559
but the privilege of preaching the Gospel,

565
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,119
of telling the story.

566
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,800
What a joy.

567
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,160
I recognize the privilege.

568
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,960
And then I would say this, number two,

569
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,240
we need to make it a priority.

570
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,960
We need to make it a priority.

571
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,040
A priority to tell the story.

572
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,880
I mean, we need to plan to tell it.

573
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
We need to have a plan.

574
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,640
We need to have an approach.

575
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,559
We need to have it as a priority.

576
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,440
It must be upon our minds. Why?

577
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,720
Because if it's not,

578
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
we're not going to do it.

579
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,960
It's not going to happen by accident.

580
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,440
We have to plan for it.

581
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,920
By the way, we plan for things

582
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,080
that are important.

583
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,240
Mostly.

584
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,800
We understand the process of planning.

585
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,520
There are some people that are planners

586
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,000
and they are very extensive

587
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,720
in their planning.

588
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,520
I heard recently someone said

589
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,919
that people spend more time

590
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,600
in a calendar year planning

591
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,479
for their annual vacation

592
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,600
than they spend planning anything

593
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,679
with regard to their walk with God.

594
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,239
Wow.

595
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,280
See, we need to plan.

596
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,760
We need to make it a priority.

597
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,559
We have organized outreach

598
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,960
as a church family

599
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,440
where we systematically, strategically

600
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,080
seek to reach our community.

601
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,119
And that's important.

602
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,600
Something to be part of.

603
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,880
Something that you're planning

604
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,119
and making a priority.

605
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,679
I'm going to put this time on my schedule,

606
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,880
on my calendar to go and make Christ known.

607
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,479
But then in your everyday life,

608
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,799
we just make it a priority

609
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,200
that I'm looking for opportunities.

610
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,239
I'm asking God to give me opportunities

611
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,000
to tell the story,

612
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,960
to share with others what Christ did for me

613
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,559
and what He could do for them.

614
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,520
Notice, back in Romans 1,

615
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,200
Paul says this in v. 15,

616
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:37,160
So, as much as in me is,

617
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,760
I am ready to preach the Gospel

618
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,600
to you that are at Rome also.

619
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
He says I am ready.

620
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,239
And that's where I get this idea

621
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,799
of making it a priority

622
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:51,479
of planning to give the Gospel

623
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,479
and to be a witness

624
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:55,960
that we would not only ask God

625
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,600
to give us the opportunities

626
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,640
and pray that He would open up doors

627
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,280
open up opportunities that we'd be looking for those opportunities and then

628
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,560
that we would seize those opportunities to tell the story, to preach Christ. Go

629
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,240
back to the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter 17. In Acts chapter number 17,

630
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,120
this is the account in which they arrive in Thessalonica. We just mentioned in

631
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,200
1 Thessalonians chapter number 2 of the entrance into. But I want you to just

632
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,120
note a few things about the terminology that God gives us as Paul would enter

633
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,920
into the city of Thessalonica and as we would see that he made it a priority in

634
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,720
his life to tell the story, to preach the gospel. In Acts 17 and verse number 1, the

635
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,800
Bible says, Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they

636
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,460
came to Thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews. And Paul, notice

637
00:40:51,460 --> 00:41:02,180
this phrase, as his manner was. Went in unto them and three Sabbath days

638
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:12,180
reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must

639
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:20,140
needs have suffered and risen again from the dead. And that this Jesus whom I

640
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:29,220
preach unto you is Christ. We notice what it was that he preached, it was the

641
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:36,980
gospel. But we notice that little phrase in verse number 2, as his manner was.

642
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,700
When Paul got into a new city, what was at the top of his list? Paul, what is it

643
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,460
that you want to do in this city? What is it that you want to set out to

644
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,620
accomplish? I want to go find out where there's some people assembled so I can

645
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,980
give them the truth of the gospel. We understand that in Philippi there was no

646
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,780
synagogue that was there, and so he goes and he finds Lydia and those that were

647
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,620
gathered over by the river. You can read of that in Acts chapter number 16. In Acts

648
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,020
chapter number 17, when they get to Thessalonica, there is a synagogue that's

649
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,020
established. There were enough Jewish men in that city to establish a synagogue. So

650
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,420
what does Paul do? As his manner was, he's going to where they are and he's going

651
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,660
to meet with them, and he's going to reason with them out of the Scriptures.

652
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,580
He's going to tell them how that Christ must needs have suffered. He goes back to

653
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,420
the Old Testament, he talks about the prophecies of the Messiah that would

654
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,380
come, and the suffering that he would endure, and how that he would pay for the

655
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,260
sin of mankind. And he says that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

656
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:45,140
And he's made it a priority. He's going to preach Christ as his manner was. The

657
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,980
people that were upset with Paul in Philippi send a group of people over to

658
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,220
Thessalonica, and man, there's all kinds of trouble that's brewing, and Paul is

659
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,020
sent to leave, and the Bible tells us in verse 14, and then

660
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,900
immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go, as it were, to the sea. But Silas

661
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,060
and Timotheus abode there still, and they that conducted Paul brought him unto

662
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:17,540
Athens, receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him

663
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,140
with all speed they departed. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his

664
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:28,740
spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Paul

665
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,420
is there, and he's in Athens because of all the trouble that he's endured, and

666
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,180
they send him there in order to really kind of get some R&R, if you will, if we

667
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,420
could use that terminology, and to be removed from all of the persecution and

668
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,780
things that were taking place, and the the anger of the individuals. And the

669
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,940
Bible tells us in verse number 5 of Acts 17 that the Jews, which believed not

670
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,380
moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, gathered

671
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,740
a company, set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, sought

672
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,180
to bring them out to the sea. I mean, it was a big deal. So Paul is now in

673
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,700
Athens, and as he's in Athens, he sees a city that's wholly given to idolatry. The

674
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,860
Bible says, therefore, in verse 17, disputed he in the synagogue with the

675
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:26,660
Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with

676
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:35,380
him. It was a priority for Paul. It was a priority. We won't take the time, but as you

677
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,860
go through the pages of the book of Acts, and you trace the steps of the Apostle

678
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:44,060
Paul, you'll find that he had opportunity to stand before the Sanhedrin, and then

679
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,540
he has opportunity. I call it opportunity because God allowed for it to happen. It

680
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,340
was under difficult circumstances, adverse situations, but he stood before

681
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,420
Felix, and he stood before Festus, and he stood before Agrippa. What does he do? He shares the

682
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,620
gospel. It was a priority for Paul. Do you understand that Paul's number one

683
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:11,740
priority was not to get released? That wasn't his number one priority. Now, that

684
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,460
might have been my number one priority. It may have been your number one

685
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,660
priority. Hey, it's not fair that I'm in these chains, in these bonds. It's not

686
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,500
fair that I'm in this position where I'm in. No, no, his number one priority was to

687
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:31,860
seize the opportunity to understand that God had him there in that place, and he

688
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:39,700
had an audience. He had an opportunity to preach Christ, and he made it a priority

689
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:46,260
in his life. The church in Thessalonica, we've mentioned much about them in this,

690
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,860
our second point of our study, but the church in Thessalonica made it a

691
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:59,500
priority as well. As the Bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 1, gives us some

692
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,740
insight about the church in Thessalonica and their fervency in giving the gospel.

693
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,380
It says in verse 7 and 8 of 1 Thessalonians 1, so that you were in

694
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,020
samples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. For from you sounded out the

695
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,340
word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your

696
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,380
faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need not to speak anything.

697
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:36,900
That's encouraging, that there is a local church that was involved, engaged in

698
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:43,100
preaching the gospel. Just as the Apostle Paul had made it a priority, as soon as

699
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,940
he gets into the city of Thessalonica, he goes to the synagogue and he meets with

700
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,260
the Jews and he begins to reason with them out of the scriptures and he

701
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,780
gives them the truth of the gospel, he preaches Christ. It was a priority for

702
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,820
Paul and those people that got saved. The Bible tells us, I read the passage that

703
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,700
talked about the ones that believe not, but the Bible says in verse 4 of Acts 17,

704
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:09,140
and some of them believed. There was a church that was established and that

705
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:16,380
church, those individual believers, they then made it a priority to preach the

706
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,500
gospel, to give the truth, to say as the songwriter said, I love to tell the

707
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:27,100
story. Can I tell you what Jesus did for me? Can I tell you how Jesus changed my

708
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:33,300
life? Can I tell you how much he loves you and what he'd like to do for you? See,

709
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,780
we recognize the privilege and then we make it a priority. Finally, if you're

710
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,220
taking notes, recognize the power. Recognize the power. Back in Romans

711
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:49,740
chapter number 1, Paul has said, I am debtor in verse 14. He says in verse

712
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:57,020
number 15, I am ready. And in verse number 16 he says, for I am not ashamed. I'm not

713
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:05,860
ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why? For it, the gospel of Christ, is the power of

714
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:13,620
God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to

715
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,500
the Greek. If I could make just a side note statement with regard to verse

716
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,340
number 16, we'll focus upon the power of the gospel and I'm so thankful and it's

717
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,100
so important that we recognize the power, but can I say to you that we need not to

718
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:38,940
be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It's becoming more and more common in our

719
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,179
society that people would say to us, well you shouldn't talk about that and you

720
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:51,660
shouldn't share your opinions and so on and so forth. Listen, let's not be ashamed

721
00:48:51,660 --> 00:49:00,619
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope that we would have, even as we've looked

722
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,780
and traced some things about the Apostle Paul, that we'd have the same

723
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,500
perspective. That we understand the message of the gospel. We understand what

724
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
it's done for us. We understand the privilege that is ours. We've made it a

725
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,540
priority. See, I'm not gonna be ashamed. I understand that not everyone's gonna

726
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:27,299
listen to me. I wish everyone would. I wish people understood the, just the

727
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:32,780
power of the message that we have and how liberating it is and how important

728
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:41,380
it is. Listen, there's a world in darkness. They're in darkness. They need what we

729
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:46,220
have. I understand that they don't think they need it. I understand they're not

730
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:51,940
aware of the fact that they need what we have, but biblically speaking we know

731
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,380
that they do. And this message is powerful. It is the power of God unto

732
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,059
salvation.

733
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:03,419
to everyone that believeth,

734
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:07,659
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

735
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:11,879
We read, as we started the book of Colossians,

736
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:14,739
on Sunday morning in verse number 6 of chapter 1,

737
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,039
how that the gospel produces fruit.

738
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:19,879
It's powerful.

739
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:22,719
We understand, as we would read the truth

740
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,339
and often quote the reference in 2 Corinthians 5

741
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,179
in verse number 17,

742
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:28,879
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

743
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,139
The power of the gospel.

744
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:36,379
I want you to consider what Paul says in Galatians 1

745
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:39,679
about his own testimony.

746
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,519
And this, of course, is written to the churches in Galatia,

747
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,179
those churches and those cities

748
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,619
during the first missionary journey.

749
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:50,379
I preached about that a little bit on Sunday evening

750
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:51,619
about the church in Antioch

751
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,319
and how they were used to send forth the first missionaries.

752
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:58,959
They go to Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe.

753
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:00,919
And here in Galatians 1,

754
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:04,199
notice what Paul says in verse number 22.

755
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,339
The Bible says this,

756
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:08,680
and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea,

757
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,319
which were in Christ.

758
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,799
But that, it says this,

759
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:16,159
but they, those believers in Judea,

760
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:19,619
they had heard only that He,

761
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:23,799
which persecuted us in times past,

762
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:27,919
now preacheth the faith

763
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:31,119
which once He destroyed,

764
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,639
and they glorified God in me.

765
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,659
Paul understood the power of the gospel in his own life.

766
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:42,319
He knew what Christ did for him.

767
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,559
And I would submit that you know what Christ did for you.

768
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,659
You know the power of the gospel.

769
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:53,399
I talk to people sometimes,

770
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:56,759
but it's just not, I just can't be saved.

771
00:51:56,759 --> 00:51:57,799
It's just not for me.

772
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,439
It's just, you know, you don't know what I've done.

773
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:01,839
You don't know what a sinner I am,

774
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:02,759
and so on and so forth.

775
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:05,040
And I often think of what the songwriter said.

776
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,439
I don't know what a sinner you are,

777
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,699
but I know what a Savior He is.

778
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:14,839
The Apostle Paul testifies

779
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:17,300
that He was the chief of all sinners.

780
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,319
That Christ Jesus came into the world

781
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,679
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

782
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,779
That's what Paul said.

783
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,919
And we understand the power of the gospel.

784
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:33,679
And Paul said, if you know, in verse 23 of Galatians 1,

785
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,959
if you know the contrast in times past,

786
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:41,039
now preacheth the faith.

787
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:43,919
What He was and now what He is

788
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:45,679
because of the power of the gospel.

789
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,020
Go back to the book of Acts, if you will.

790
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,699
We'll close here in Acts chapter number nine.

791
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:53,459
And I just want to read a few verses to you

792
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:55,679
about the conversion of Paul.

793
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,380
We know that his name is still Saul

794
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,520
here in Acts chapter number nine.

795
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,300
It would be changed to Paul in Acts chapter number 13

796
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,639
during that first missionary journey.

797
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,380
And here in Acts nine, we read of the conversion.

798
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,860
And I want to read a couple of verses

799
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,779
at the beginning of Acts nine,

800
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:14,099
and then I'm going to skip to verse number 20.

801
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,000
And I want you to see the difference.

802
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,679
It says in verse number one of Acts nine,

803
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:22,000
and Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter

804
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,440
against the disciples of the Lord,

805
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,080
went unto the high priest

806
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,679
and desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues,

807
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,839
that if he found any of this way,

808
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,639
whether they were men or women,

809
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:37,500
he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

810
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,599
Paul was going with a mission.

811
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,679
He was trying to stamp out

812
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,580
these that were following Christ.

813
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,919
We'll skip the next several verses

814
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:57,319
that rehearse for us and record for us his conversion,

815
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,279
because I want you to see what the Bible tells us

816
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,699
in verse number 19 and 20.

817
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,959
It says, and when he, Paul, Saul,

818
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:06,919
that is his name here at this time,

819
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:10,959
when he had received me, he was strengthened,

820
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,279
then with Saul certain days with the disciples

821
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:15,559
which were at Damascus,

822
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:20,559
and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues

823
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,600
that he is the Son of God.

824
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,239
What happened to this man, Saul?

825
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:29,260
I mean, he's breathing out threatenings.

826
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,399
I mean, he's ready to go to Damascus.

827
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:34,679
He's received letters in order to have the authority

828
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,880
to arrest those that would be of this way,

829
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,799
that he could take them and bring them bound

830
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,040
back to Jerusalem, and yet then we find

831
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,000
that he's preaching Christ in the synagogues,

832
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,639
that he is the Son of God.

833
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,079
Well, the Gospel's powerful.

834
00:54:55,399 --> 00:55:00,119
Along the way on the road to Damascus,

835
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,559
there was a bright light that shined from heaven.

836
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:08,399
And here's a voice, Saul, Saul,

837
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,160
why persecutest thou me?

838
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,000
And Saul says, who art thou, Lord?

839
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,399
Jesus says, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

840
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,519
And Saul would then say, Lord, he, Lord,

841
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,880
what wilt thou have me to do?

842
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,279
He recognized that Jesus is Lord.

843
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,119
In fact, the Bible tells us Paul would be used of God

844
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,279
to pen the words in the book of Philippians

845
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,320
that we've often mentioned, that in the name of Jesus,

846
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,919
every knee should bow, things in heaven,

847
00:55:49,919 --> 00:55:51,440
and things in earth, and things under the earth,

848
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,440
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord

849
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,760
to the glory of God the Father.

850
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,839
Saul confessed that in Acts 9.

851
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,480
He understood the power of the Gospel.

852
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:08,200
Why is it that we love to tell the story?

853
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,359
Well, it's a privilege.

854
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:14,919
I am debtor.

855
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:16,440
I'm allowed of God.

856
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:22,000
We need to make it a priority to tell the story.

857
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,440
We need to plan to do so.

858
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,079
This year, maybe after this message,

859
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,160
you should sit down and ask the Lord to help you

860
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,720
to devise a plan on how you're gonna get the Gospel out.

861
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:39,359
Maybe when you come to church on Sunday,

862
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,160
you need to grab a handful of Gospel tracts.

863
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,160
We have them in our lobby,

864
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,720
available for you to take and distribute.

865
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,320
Maybe you wanna take some John and Romans this year

866
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,600
and share them with your neighbors.

867
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,239
However the Lord might impress upon your heart,

868
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:59,040
but make it a priority.

869
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,320
Plan to get the Gospel out,

870
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:06,519
and then recognize the power of the Gospel.

871
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,720
What did it do for you?

872
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,079
Changed my life.

873
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,359
The day in my life when my direction changed entirely,

874
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,799
just as it did for Saul in Acts 9.

875
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,639
I didn't go and straightway preach the Gospel

876
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,919
as quickly as he did,

877
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,399
but my life was changed.

878
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,040
It was a new creature because of the power of the Gospel.

879
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,679
And we understand that the Gospel has the power

880
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:42,679
still today to change lives.

881
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:46,679
Jesus saves, we sing the song.

882
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,000
And what a great song it is.

883
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,119
Jesus saves, he does.

884
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,440
But they need to know about the Savior.

885
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,160
Oh, that God would help us

886
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,959
to take the Gospel to every creature.

887
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:01,679
Father, we love you.

888
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:02,799
We thank you for loving us.

889
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:03,880
We thank you for the privilege,

890
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,799
once again, of studying your Word.

891
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:09,959
What a joy to have the Bible.

892
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,160
I pray, God, that you would help us

893
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,440
as we consider the content of this message.

894
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Help us to recognize the privilege

895
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:29,119
of sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

896
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,440
Help us, God, to make it a priority.

897
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,320
Help us to recognize the power

898
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,239
of this message that we proclaim.

899
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,400
I pray that as you would work in our hearts individually

900
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,000
and as a church corporately,

901
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:46,919
God, we would see many souls saved this year.

902
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,080
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

903
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,039
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

904
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:58,479
Amen.
