WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
All right, we're having our midweek service.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.640
We're pre recording it again, like we did last week.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.960
And I'll be emailing out a link on YouTube for you to be able to watch the service we're

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.879
pre recording so that the rest of the week, we will not be in the church building, and

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:23.139
other folks will be able to come in and take care of things because of the quarantine protocol.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:27.479
But certainly thankful for technology that we're able to do this thankful for Holly and

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:32.180
the kiddos helping out with all the aspects of the service, we do trust it to be a blessing

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.340
to you.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340
And we're going to sing a couple of songs.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.540
The first one is this God will take care of you.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.500
And it's number 579 in our hymnal God will take care of you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:57.360
God will take care of you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.360
God will take care of you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.360
God will take care of you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.220
God will take care of you

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.220
God will take care of you

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.220
Through every day or all the way

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.220
He will take care of you

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.220
God will take care of you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.080
Through days of toil and hardships

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.080
God will take care of you

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.080
When dangers reach your path of sin

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.080
God will take care of you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.940
God will take care of you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.940
Through every day or all the way

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.940
He will take care of you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.940
God will take care of you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
All you may need He will provide

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.800
God will take care of you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.800
Nothing you ask will be denied

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.800
God will take care of you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.660
God will take care of you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.660
Through every day or all the way

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.660
He will take care of you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.660
God will take care of you

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.520
No matter what may be the test

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.520
God will take care of you

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.520
When weary or hung upon His breast

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.520
God will take care of you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.380
God will take care of you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.380
Through every day or all the way

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.380
He will take care of you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.380
God will take care of you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.239
God will take care of you

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.239
Through every day or all the way

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:30.239
He will take care of you

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:36.239
God will take care of you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.100
Thank you for the opportunity to have that calm rest and assurance that God will take care of you.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.100
He is able and what a blessing and so thankful for the opportunity to have service

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.100
And thankful for just the blessings that God has bestowed upon us individually and corporately.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100
Let's go to the Lord in prayer.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.100
Father, we do love you and we thank you for loving us.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.100
We thank you for the privilege of being able to worship you.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:09.959
We thank you for the work that you did in our hearts and lives on Sunday.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:17.959
And God, we pray that as we once again open your word today, Lord, I pray that you would challenge us and convict us and comfort us.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.959
I pray, God, that you'd help each one to be attentive and responsive.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.959
I pray, God, that the word of God would minister to our hearts.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:31.959
We thank you for this hymn, Lord, this song that had been written many years ago

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.820
that even still ministers to the hearts of your people today.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.820
And God, I pray that you would help us to rest in the truth of what the songwriter was writing about.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.820
Lord, we thank you for the promise in the book of 1 Peter in the 5th chapter

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.820
that we can cast all our care upon you knowing that you care for us

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.820
and what great comfort that is and what great joy, peace, and rest it brings to our hearts.

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.679
We do pray that you'd watch over those that are dealing with health issues.

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:05.679
We pray, God, that you'd touch bodies, give healing.

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:11.679
We pray, God, that you would be exalted and magnified through all that's said and done throughout this service.

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.679
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.679
I do want to encourage you to continue to pray, if you will, for the Peterson family

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:21.679
and for Virginia and Yolanda and also for the Cooks and the Currys.

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:25.679
And if you would, continue to pray for Brother Ronnie Hall.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.540
He, of course, has been dealing with back and hip trouble

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.540
and it's been extremely painful for him at times and he's seeming to improve some.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.540
And so if you would continue to pray for Brother Ronnie, I know that he'd appreciate that.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.540
And then if you'd pray for Brother Manuel, he is scheduled to have surgery next week.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540
And so we're praying that he'll receive this week all of the clearances from the doctors

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.540
that he needs to receive in order to go forward to have the surgery.

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:58.399
And that's going to be just a very, we're praying, a very successful shoulder surgery.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.399
Obviously, there'll be some time of rehab and all that sort of thing.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.399
And so we'll need to be praying for Brother Manuel for several weeks now

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.399
with regard to all of those things.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.399
But we are trusting that it will give him relief from the pain in which he's been dealing with

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.399
and give him more mobility.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:18.399
And I know that the Fesdechian family greatly appreciates your prayers.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:23.459
I do want to encourage you to pray for some of our missionaries and then also some church planters.

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.459
And I know that I've shared with you over the last several months about a couple of church planters.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:32.459
One of them is Brother Ben Webster at Newport News Baptist Church.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:36.459
And they are still looking to be able to get into their own property.

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:41.459
And they've had a few obstacles that have come in their way.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:44.459
But God is greater and God is able.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.519
And so if you would pray for wisdom and direction for the Newport News Baptist Church

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:52.519
and Brother Ben Webster and the church family there that God would give clarity

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.519
with regard to the decisions that need to be made.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.519
And that he would open up the doors and make things clear to them.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.519
I know they'd appreciate that.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:05.519
And then there's a new church planter that I have just recently been made aware of

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.519
and had the opportunity of meeting.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.519
And his name is Brother Zach Hauser.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.519
And he's planted a church up in Delaware.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.579
And God is working and God is moving.

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:16.579
And we're very thankful.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:21.579
It's exciting to hear about churches that are being established in our region.

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:24.579
And then also, of course, around the globe.

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:28.579
Please do continue to pray for the Savali family and the situation there in Samoa

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:29.579
with their church plant.

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:34.580
And I hope to be able to get some information from Brother Savali here this week

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.580
with regard to the meeting with the tribal leaders and the Mamali and all of that

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.580
that needs to take place.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.640
But I know that he greatly appreciates your prayers.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.640
Do pray, if you will, for Brother Paul Mershon.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.640
I mentioned last year a number of meetings have been canceled.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.640
And this is continuing.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.640
Of course, they're based out in California.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.640
They continue to have more and more travel bans and restrictions

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.640
and various things going on there in the state of California.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.640
And so if you'd pray for Brother Mershon and his wife, Linda,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.700
that God would just give them wisdom and direction with regard to their meeting schedule.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.700
I know they'd greatly appreciate that.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.700
And then also pray for Brother Hummel and Beacon of Truth.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.700
And I spoke with Brother Hummel just the other day.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.700
And they're doing well.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700
They had an assembly to start the year.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.700
It was a Saturday assembly.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.700
And then had church with that congregation on Sunday.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.700
And a brand-new church, brand-new.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.700
Actually, the church itself is only about two years old.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.760
And it was their first time of having a scripture assembly.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.760
And so that was exciting news to hear about a brand-new church

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.760
that's getting involved with the ministry.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760
And they had their first assembly.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.760
And they enjoyed it so much that they said it's something that they want to do regularly,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760
such as what we have done.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.760
And they're inquiring about purchasing staplers

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.760
and being able to get all of the supplies

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.760
and things that they need to do on a regular basis.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.760
And so that was encouraging to me.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.760
Obviously, very encouraging to Brother Hummel.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.940
And so if you would pray for the Beacon of Truth Baptist Ministries, they have had some

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.860
meetings canceled that they had scheduled here in the first quarter of 2021.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:16.100
So if you would pray for wisdom and then also they're seeking to get that facility completed

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.100
up in Bedford.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.220
I know that Brother Hummel shared some things with you all when he was here back in December

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.400
and they are moving forward.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.820
He was sharing with me kind of the timeline on some of the additional things that need

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.820
to be done.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.540
But it's very exciting to hear about the work that's being done and the progress that's

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.780
taking place and looking forward to being able to hear about the completion of that

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.500
project and being able to schedule our first trip to go up to Bedford to put scriptures

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.660
together and to be a blessing and a help to the Beacon of Truth Baptist Ministries to

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.060
get the word of God around the world.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.380
Continue to pray for the parsonage and the project is completing.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:58.040
In fact, as we're recording here, this message, the men are out there working and they are

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.360
making good progress.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.040
The trusses, it's my understanding, will be installed tomorrow and looking forward to

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.840
being able to see the structure just making more and more progress day by day.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.600
And so thank you for your prayers for that project.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.560
Let's go to the Lord in prayer as we'll have a time of offering and I do thank you for

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.000
your faithfulness and giving what a privilege it is to give to the Lord.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And let's pray.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.820
Father, we thank you for the privilege of giving.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.740
We thank you for the faithfulness of your people and Lord, we thank you and acknowledge

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.300
the plan that you have for the financing of the local church through the people of God.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.160
And I pray that you'd help us to give cheerfully and appropriately, that you'd bless the gift

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
and giver.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.780
Lord, that you'd use the funds for the furtherance of the ministry here and around the world.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.020
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.820
All right, we're going to sing our theme song, Complete in Thee.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:18.820
Let's sing, All Your Anxiety.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:34.820
Is there a heart, Lord, bound by sorrow?

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.820
Is there a life weighed down by care?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.820
Come to the cross, each burden bearing.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:53.820
All your anxiety, leave it there.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.820
All your anxiety, all your care.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:05.820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:19.820
Never a friend like Jesus.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:26.820
No other friend so keen to help you.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.820
No other friend so quick to hear.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:38.820
No other place to leave your burden.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.820
No other one to hear your prayer.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:52.820
All your anxiety, all your care.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:05.820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:12.820
Never a friend like Jesus.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.820
Come and at once, delay no longer.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:25.820
He is entreaty, kind and sweet.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:31.820
You need not fear a disappointment.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.820
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.820
All your anxiety, all your care.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:50.820
Bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:57.820
Never a burden ye cannot bear.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:04.820
Never a friend like Jesus.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.820
Well, amen.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:17.820
Both of those hymns were greatly encouraging to my heart today,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.820
and I hope to yours as well.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.820
And what a blessing to know that we can.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.820
We have someone, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.820
that we can take our burdens to and leave them with him.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.820
You know, we're living in the midst of great anxiety.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:43.820
We see, we hear of reports all around us of those that are dealing with anxiety,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.820
and they're anxious over the things that are taking place in our world.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.820
They're anxious for many reasons.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.820
And I'm thankful as a child of God that though we're in the world, we're not of the world.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.820
And I'm thankful that when the world seems as if it's falling apart,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.820
that we can have that peace that passeth all understanding,

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.820
that we can rest in him knowing that he cares for us,

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.820
that we can take our anxiety, our cares,

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.820
and take it to the mercy seat and leave it there,

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.820
knowing that he is able to help.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.820
I'm so thankful that the Bible teaches us

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.820
that our God is a very present help in the time of trouble.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.820
He is our helper.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.820
There are times in which maybe all we can do is say as the psalmist said,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.820
Help, Lord!

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.820
And I'm thankful that he is able to help.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.820
He's ready to help.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.820
He is the creator of all things.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.820
He spoke it all into existence.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.820
He sustains it all by his own power.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.820
And he's my God, my Savior.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.820
What a blessing.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.820
Romans chapter number 1 is where we'll be for our study here this evening.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.820
I love to tell the story.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.820
It will be the title of the message today.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.820
And Romans chapter number 1.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.820
And as we begin to kind of think of where we are with regard to our study here,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.820
this is a doctrinal study that has been kind of a side study of the book of Titus.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.820
We started a study in our adult Sunday school class through the book of Titus a number of months ago.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.820
Actually, it's almost been a year ago,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:28.820
but that was suspended for a period of time as we did not have Sunday school with the pandemic and what have you.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.820
And then when we resumed our student ministries,

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:36.820
we returned to our study with here in the sanctuary on the book of Titus.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.820
And Titus chapter 2 and verse number 1 says,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.820
but speak now the things which become sound doctrine.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.820
We understand the importance of doctrine.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.820
We understand the source of doctrine.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.820
And we've taken for now a number of weeks and looked at some doctrinal things.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:02.820
In fact, we've been dealing with the doctrine of Christ and where we started our study on the doctrine of Christ was in Matthew chapter number 16.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.820
It was in that passage of Scripture in which the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to his disciples.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.820
He says, whom do men say that I, the son of man am?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.820
And he asked that question, what a very important question, a pertinent question, no doubt.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:20.820
We find that as they would hear the question and then give response that in their response,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:28.820
it reveals to us that there was a level of confusion amongst the people in the day of Jesus's time.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.820
We find that he had walked upon the earth.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.820
His earthly ministry was moving forward.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.820
And there were many that knew about Jesus.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.820
They knew of the miracles that he had performed.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.820
They heard about Jesus.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:49.820
But unfortunately, there was some confusion with regard to who he is.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.820
When he asked the question to the disciples, they say, well, some say that you're John the Baptist.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.820
Some say that you're Jeremiah, Isaiah, one of the prophets, so on and so forth.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.880
And through their response, we've noted and we've dealt with the confusion.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:12.620
I've said this, that that same level of confusion exists today.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:19.120
The question that Jesus asked to His disciples nearly 2,000 years ago is a question that

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.440
still needs to be asked today.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.240
Who is Jesus?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.300
Who is He?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.860
Today the answers may vary from the answers that were given by the disciples on that particular

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.900
day.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.340
And there would be some that would say, well, He's a teacher.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.540
He's a prophet.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.380
He's a good man.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.540
There are various answers that may be provided.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:52.180
But I'm thankful for what Peter stood and proclaimed, thou art the Christ, the Son of

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.820
the living God.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.380
Why did Peter proclaim that?

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.260
Well, because Jesus said, whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.780
And he received their answer and understood the confusion of the people.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.540
But then he says, but whom say ye that I am?

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:15.380
And Peter proclaimed with confidence and courage that Jesus is the Messiah, the anointed one,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.660
the promised one.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.360
And what a joy it is to know Him.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.800
What a privilege it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ, that He is God in flesh, that He is

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.400
my Savior.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:37.860
We went and spent several weeks dealing with the subject matter from the song, Jesus is

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.040
all the world to me.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.440
We asked the question, would you say that Jesus is all the world to you?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.720
If you would, and someone were to say why, what would your answers be?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.040
In no way was our study exhaustive.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.680
We simply looked at a few reasons from the Word of God as to why we might say that Jesus

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:05.880
is all the world to me, because of who He is, because of His mighty power, because of

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.240
His death, burial, and resurrection, because of His work today, and because He's coming

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240
back for me.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.880
Oh, those are just a few reasons as to why Jesus is all the world to me.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.400
But as we continue with the thought of the doctrine of Christ and understanding that

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.280
we as saved people would stand and proclaim that Jesus is all the world to me, that we

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:36.680
would know and could answer the question appropriately as Peter did, that we know that He, Jesus,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.400
is the Christ, the Son of the living God, He's God in flesh.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.040
There is a world of people that do not know who Jesus is.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.560
They don't know Him.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.720
Some know about Him.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:57.040
Unfortunately, as we move further and further away from the truth of the Word of God, as

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:06.080
our society seeks to stamp out any references to God or Christianity, there are a number

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:12.120
of young people that they have no idea even about Jesus.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.640
Thus, I love to tell the story.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.160
It's a song that's very familiar to most of us.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.240
In fact, we had the privilege of singing this song on Sunday.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:39.080
And I just want to read one verse of the song as we get into the lesson.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.120
It's verse number three where the Bible says,

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:47.120
I love to tell the story, tis pleasant to repeat.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:54.840
What seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.040
I wonder if that's true for us.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:07.960
Each time you tell the story of Jesus and His love, does it grow sweeter and sweeter?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.280
You recognize what He did for you, how He saved your soul.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:21.720
It continues, I love to tell the story, for some have never heard.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:31.320
The message of salvation from God's own Holy Word.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:38.279
I do not seek to correct the songwriter, but I would say that when it says for some have

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:43.960
never heard, it's probably more accurate to say many have never heard.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.440
There are many in our world today that have never heard the message of salvation from

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.679
God's own Holy Word.

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:58.800
Therefore, we sing as the redeemed of the Lord, I love to tell the story.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.320
And I wonder, do you love to tell the story?

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.960
If you love to tell the story, that would mean that you're telling the story.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.480
Amen?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:20.119
It's not fair for me or for any one of us to say I love to tell the story or to sing

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:26.399
I love to tell the story, and yet never tell the story.

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:34.940
That would be hypocrisy, but the reality is that we ought to love to tell the story because

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:41.679
it did so much for me, as the songwriter said in another one of the verses.

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:46.839
That story is the story of salvation, of Jesus and His love.

00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:51.200
Notice with me in Romans chapter number one, we'll look at three verses of Scripture, verse

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.559
14, 15, and 16, and I will let you know it's in Bible study, so we'll be in a number of

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:59.679
different passages of Scripture, so get your fingers ready.

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:04.720
And as we look through these three verses, really they'll be used as our points for our

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.040
outline and our message this evening.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.000
The Bible says this, Paul is speaking, it says in verse number 14, I am debtor both

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.399
to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:30.279
So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:38.860
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation,

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:46.160
to every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.040
As we look at this passage of Scripture and use it as our basis for our outline in this

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.460
study, I love to tell the story.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.860
I would say this, number one, we should recognize the privilege.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.300
You know, it is a unique privilege that we have as the people of God to repeat the story,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.679
the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:08.679
What a unique privilege.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:19.500
I understand it's a responsibility, and we must not forget that it is a responsibility.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:26.700
It is a responsibility for every child of God to give the gospel.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.500
The great commission, as I said on Sunday morning, is our mission.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.580
The great commission is that we would go into the world and preach the gospel to every creature,

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:44.399
and that responsibility is laid upon every single person that has been born again.

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:45.399
It's our duty.

00:27:45.399 --> 00:27:47.520
It's our responsibility.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.520
But I would say as we consider the subject matter and think about this song, I love to

00:27:52.520 --> 00:28:01.119
tell the story, could I help you and help myself understand that it is a privilege,

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:08.500
and we need to recognize the privilege that God would give us to be the bearers of good

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:20.179
news, that God would use us to be the servants, the individuals to proclaim the gospel message.

00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:22.260
Think about those shepherds.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.339
I preached about them back in December.

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:30.640
Those shepherds, we examined the passage of Scripture, and we observed some things

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.520
about those shepherds, and they received that message unto you.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.559
There was some good news of glad tidings, and that message was given to them, but it

00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:44.520
was to be to all people.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:56.979
What a privilege was theirs to go and share with others the message that they had received.

00:28:56.979 --> 00:29:05.260
And we note that in verse number 14 of Romans 1, Paul says, notice what he says, I am debtor

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.700
both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.400
See, we need to recognize the privilege that is ours to tell the story.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.919
I want you to remember of what the disciples said, turn back to the book of Acts, if you

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:21.280
will, in chapter number 5.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:29.679
In Acts chapter number 5, early on in the advancement of the gospel in Jerusalem, many

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:35.080
wonderful things are taking place, but there's opposition, persecution, threats, beatings,

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.200
all sorts of things, imprisonment, all these things going on.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.359
But I want you to notice and remember what the disciples say.

00:29:43.359 --> 00:29:49.760
In Acts chapter number 5, in verse number 28, the accusers, the opposition, they said

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.760
this to the disciples, did not, we straightly command you that you should not teach in this

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760
name.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760
And behold, ye have failed.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.280
You filled Jerusalem with Your doctrine

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.160
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.540
Oh, that it would be said that we filled

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.240
our Jerusalem with the teaching of Jesus Christ,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.700
with the Gospel.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.800
Oh, what a blessing I'm told

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.480
of a church in California

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.720
that is so consistent on getting into their community

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.000
to preach the Gospel and to share the Gospel

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.240
with their community.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.280
They have a purpose and a plan,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.640
a strategy if you will,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.040
to reach their community.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.200
And they've been so committed and so faithful

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.440
that there are people within the community

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.800
that have made signs and put on their doors,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.400
if you're from such-and-such a Baptist church,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.600
we're not interested.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.560
I like it.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.440
I don't like that the people aren't interested.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.440
But what I like is that the church

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.680
has taken the responsibility

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.600
and the privilege of going with a system

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.920
and with a plan

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.240
and strategically going to reach their community.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.040
What a blessing.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.840
It says in v. 29 of Acts 5,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.680
then Peter and the other apostles answered and said,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.360
we ought to obey God rather than men.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.520
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.360
from Yisra'el and hanged on a tree.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.280
Him hath God exalted with His right hand

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.800
to be a Prince and a Savior

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.640
for to give repentance to Israel

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.160
and forgiveness of sins.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:43.160
And v. 32, we are His witnesses of these things.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.200
We're His witnesses.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.120
They were eyewitnesses.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.800
They were the witnesses

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.720
and we are witnesses.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.120
And what a privilege to be a witness

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.080
to go and to proclaim the message,

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.800
the story, the greatest story ever told.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.240
The story of Jesus and His love.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.040
The story of redemption

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.160
through the blood of Christ.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.840
And we're privileged to be able to take that message.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.320
Paul says to the believers in 2 Corinthians 5

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.640
that we're ambassadors.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.040
You know, to be an ambassador is a privileged position.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.000
And as the children of God,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
God calls us as His people

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.120
because we are ambassadors.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.200
We understand that our citizenship is in heaven.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.800
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.560
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.600
This world is not my home,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.040
as the songwriter said.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.720
Jesus said that we're in the world,

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.120
but we're not of the world.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.800
And we understand that we are ambassadors.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.200
We've been entrusted with a responsibility

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.240
and it is a privilege

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.520
to represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.920
Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.000
You'll notice two statements of Paul.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.360
One here in 1 Corinthians

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.000
and then another over in 1 Thessalonians.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.880
But notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.280
when we consider and recognize the privilege.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.920
I love to tell the story.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.480
It is a privilege to tell the story.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.360
To proclaim the Gospel.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.040
That God would use us.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.760
Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 9

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.240
verse 16 and 17,

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.360
"'For though I preach the Gospel,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.080
I have nothing to glory of,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.840
for necessity is laid upon me.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.360
Yea, woe is unto me

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.360
if I preach not the Gospel.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.040
For if I do this thing willingly,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.000
I have a reward.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.280
But if against my will,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.320
a dispensation of the Gospel

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.360
is committed unto me.'"

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.040
Paul says,

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.320
"'Woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel.'"

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:48.760
He says,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.000
"'If I do this thing willingly,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.840
I have a reward.'"

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.400
It's a privilege to take the Gospel.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.640
We notice what Paul says

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.440
in 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.520
Take and turn over that passage if you will.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.680
Paul had the privilege of going

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.920
into the town of Thessalonica

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.800
and delivering the Gospel.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.880
Seeing a church established.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.760
Best we can tell,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.360
he was not there for any lengthy period of time.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.119
He spent a significant amount of time

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:21.880
in Ephesus and in Corinth,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.080
but in Thessalonica,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.880
he was not able to spend much time there

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.960
because of the opposition.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.559
But I want you to notice what he says.

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:32.920
And focus upon the verbage,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.680
the terminology that Paul uses

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.360
when he's speaking to these individuals

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.520
in verse 1 of chapter 2.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:39.920
It says,

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.440
"'For yourselves, brethren,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.800
know our entrance in unto you

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.320
that it was not in vain.'"

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.520
By the way,

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.080
if we consider that last phrase

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.760
of verse 1,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.839
and we couple it with 1 Corinthians 15

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:56.119
and verse 58,

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:59.040
our work is not in vain in the Lord.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.160
Amen?

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.559
He says,

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.040
"'Our entrance in unto you

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.920
that it was not in vain.'"

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.839
Listen, there are times

00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.640
in which you might take the Gospel to somebody

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.080
and you think,

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.279
man, they weren't interested.

00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:10.960
And you walk away perhaps discouraged,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.360
but you have to understand

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.080
that as Paul said to the believers in Corinth,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.480
that some plant some water,

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.040
but God gives the increase.

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:20.600
The Holy Spirit of God

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.000
is able to use the Word of God

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.640
and work in the heart of the individual.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:24.960
He says,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.720
"'It was not in vain.'"

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.160
Verse 2,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.760
"'But even after that we had suffered before

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.279
and were shamefully entreated,

00:35:30.279 --> 00:35:32.559
as you know, at Philippi,

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:34.600
we were bold in our God

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600
to speak unto you

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.200
the Gospel of God with much contention.'"

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.600
And so they had boldness

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.880
in spite of this continued persecution

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.080
that they were dealing with.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.600
If you go back to the book of Acts

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.839
and you read in Acts 16 and 17

00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:48.600
and read all that was taking place

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.119
in Philippi and Thessalonica

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:53.040
as he references those two places

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.440
in particular here in these verses of Scripture,

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.760
you find that he says

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.040
that even in light of those things,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.480
we were bold in our God.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.559
Now that's important for us to understand.

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:08.000
We go in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.080
It's Jesus Christ that gave the commission

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.760
and said, I will be with you.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.119
It says this in verse 3,

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.040
"'For our exhortation was not of deceit

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.960
nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.'"

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.040
Notice this phrase,

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.760
"'But,' in verse 4,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.480
"'as we were allowed of God

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.600
to be put in trust with the Gospel,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.160
even so we speak,

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.320
not as pleasing men,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.119
but God which trieth our hearts.'"

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:39.119
You notice what he says

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.160
in the beginning of verse 4,

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.080
"'But as we were allowed of God

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.960
to be put in trust with the Gospel.'"

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.880
You understand that God has allowed us

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.600
to be put in trust with the Gospel?

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.800
The church, as Paul is writing to Timothy,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.559
is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:36:56.559 --> 00:36:58.760
And as individual believers,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.160
we've been allowed of God.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.200
He's given us this privilege.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.480
Paul says, I am debtor.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480
I am privileged.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.640
When I think about the song,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.920
when I think about the question

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.279
that Jesus asked

00:37:14.279 --> 00:37:16.880
and the confusion that existed

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.080
in the day of Christ,

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.279
and I think about the world

00:37:20.279 --> 00:37:21.640
in which we currently live

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.600
and the confusion that exists

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.080
with regard to the question,

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.200
who is Jesus?

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.080
I'm mindful of the fact that God

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.119
has given us the privilege

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:35.559
of not only knowing Him,

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:38.559
but the privilege of preaching the Gospel,

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:42.119
of telling the story.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.800
What a joy.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.160
I recognize the privilege.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.960
And then I would say this, number two,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.240
we need to make it a priority.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.960
We need to make it a priority.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.040
A priority to tell the story.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.880
I mean, we need to plan to tell it.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.880
We need to have a plan.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.640
We need to have an approach.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.559
We need to have it as a priority.

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:03.440
It must be upon our minds. Why?

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.720
Because if it's not,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.040
we're not going to do it.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.960
It's not going to happen by accident.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.440
We have to plan for it.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.920
By the way, we plan for things

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.080
that are important.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.240
Mostly.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.800
We understand the process of planning.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.520
There are some people that are planners

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.000
and they are very extensive

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.720
in their planning.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.520
I heard recently someone said

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.919
that people spend more time

00:38:32.919 --> 00:38:34.600
in a calendar year planning

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.479
for their annual vacation

00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:39.600
than they spend planning anything

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.679
with regard to their walk with God.

00:38:42.679 --> 00:38:45.239
Wow.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.280
See, we need to plan.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.760
We need to make it a priority.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.559
We have organized outreach

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:52.960
as a church family

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.440
where we systematically, strategically

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.080
seek to reach our community.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.119
And that's important.

00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:02.600
Something to be part of.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.880
Something that you're planning

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.119
and making a priority.

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.679
I'm going to put this time on my schedule,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.880
on my calendar to go and make Christ known.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.479
But then in your everyday life,

00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:14.799
we just make it a priority

00:39:14.799 --> 00:39:17.200
that I'm looking for opportunities.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.239
I'm asking God to give me opportunities

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:23.000
to tell the story,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.960
to share with others what Christ did for me

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.559
and what He could do for them.

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:31.520
Notice, back in Romans 1,

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.200
Paul says this in v. 15,

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:37.160
So, as much as in me is,

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.760
I am ready to preach the Gospel

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.600
to you that are at Rome also.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.400
He says I am ready.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.239
And that's where I get this idea

00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:48.799
of making it a priority

00:39:48.799 --> 00:39:51.479
of planning to give the Gospel

00:39:51.479 --> 00:39:53.479
and to be a witness

00:39:53.479 --> 00:39:55.960
that we would not only ask God

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.600
to give us the opportunities

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.640
and pray that He would open up doors

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.280
open up opportunities that we'd be looking for those opportunities and then

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.560
that we would seize those opportunities to tell the story, to preach Christ. Go

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.240
back to the book of Acts, if you will, in chapter 17. In Acts chapter number 17,

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.120
this is the account in which they arrive in Thessalonica. We just mentioned in

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.200
1 Thessalonians chapter number 2 of the entrance into. But I want you to just

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.120
note a few things about the terminology that God gives us as Paul would enter

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.920
into the city of Thessalonica and as we would see that he made it a priority in

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.720
his life to tell the story, to preach the gospel. In Acts 17 and verse number 1, the

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.800
Bible says, Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:51.460
came to Thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews. And Paul, notice

00:40:51.460 --> 00:41:02.180
this phrase, as his manner was. Went in unto them and three Sabbath days

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:12.180
reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:20.140
needs have suffered and risen again from the dead. And that this Jesus whom I

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:29.220
preach unto you is Christ. We notice what it was that he preached, it was the

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:36.980
gospel. But we notice that little phrase in verse number 2, as his manner was.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.700
When Paul got into a new city, what was at the top of his list? Paul, what is it

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.460
that you want to do in this city? What is it that you want to set out to

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.620
accomplish? I want to go find out where there's some people assembled so I can

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.980
give them the truth of the gospel. We understand that in Philippi there was no

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.780
synagogue that was there, and so he goes and he finds Lydia and those that were

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.620
gathered over by the river. You can read of that in Acts chapter number 16. In Acts

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.020
chapter number 17, when they get to Thessalonica, there is a synagogue that's

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.020
established. There were enough Jewish men in that city to establish a synagogue. So

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:16.420
what does Paul do? As his manner was, he's going to where they are and he's going

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.660
to meet with them, and he's going to reason with them out of the Scriptures.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.580
He's going to tell them how that Christ must needs have suffered. He goes back to

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.420
the Old Testament, he talks about the prophecies of the Messiah that would

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.380
come, and the suffering that he would endure, and how that he would pay for the

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:37.260
sin of mankind. And he says that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:45.140
And he's made it a priority. He's going to preach Christ as his manner was. The

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:50.980
people that were upset with Paul in Philippi send a group of people over to

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:56.220
Thessalonica, and man, there's all kinds of trouble that's brewing, and Paul is

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:02.020
sent to leave, and the Bible tells us in verse 14, and then

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.900
immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go, as it were, to the sea. But Silas

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.060
and Timotheus abode there still, and they that conducted Paul brought him unto

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:17.540
Athens, receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.140
with all speed they departed. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:28.740
spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Paul

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.420
is there, and he's in Athens because of all the trouble that he's endured, and

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:38.180
they send him there in order to really kind of get some R&R, if you will, if we

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.420
could use that terminology, and to be removed from all of the persecution and

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.780
things that were taking place, and the the anger of the individuals. And the

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.940
Bible tells us in verse number 5 of Acts 17 that the Jews, which believed not

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.380
moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, gathered

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.740
a company, set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, sought

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.180
to bring them out to the sea. I mean, it was a big deal. So Paul is now in

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:13.700
Athens, and as he's in Athens, he sees a city that's wholly given to idolatry. The

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:19.860
Bible says, therefore, in verse 17, disputed he in the synagogue with the

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:26.660
Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:35.380
him. It was a priority for Paul. It was a priority. We won't take the time, but as you

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.860
go through the pages of the book of Acts, and you trace the steps of the Apostle

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:44.060
Paul, you'll find that he had opportunity to stand before the Sanhedrin, and then

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.540
he has opportunity. I call it opportunity because God allowed for it to happen. It

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:54.340
was under difficult circumstances, adverse situations, but he stood before

00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:00.420
Felix, and he stood before Festus, and he stood before Agrippa. What does he do? He shares the

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:05.620
gospel. It was a priority for Paul. Do you understand that Paul's number one

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:11.740
priority was not to get released? That wasn't his number one priority. Now, that

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:15.460
might have been my number one priority. It may have been your number one

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.660
priority. Hey, it's not fair that I'm in these chains, in these bonds. It's not

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.500
fair that I'm in this position where I'm in. No, no, his number one priority was to

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:31.860
seize the opportunity to understand that God had him there in that place, and he

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:39.700
had an audience. He had an opportunity to preach Christ, and he made it a priority

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:46.260
in his life. The church in Thessalonica, we've mentioned much about them in this,

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.860
our second point of our study, but the church in Thessalonica made it a

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:59.500
priority as well. As the Bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 1, gives us some

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:06.740
insight about the church in Thessalonica and their fervency in giving the gospel.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.380
It says in verse 7 and 8 of 1 Thessalonians 1, so that you were in

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:18.020
samples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. For from you sounded out the

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.340
word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:28.380
faith to God were to spread abroad, so that we need not to speak anything.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:36.900
That's encouraging, that there is a local church that was involved, engaged in

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:43.100
preaching the gospel. Just as the Apostle Paul had made it a priority, as soon as

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.940
he gets into the city of Thessalonica, he goes to the synagogue and he meets with

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.260
the Jews and he begins to reason with them out of the scriptures and he

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.780
gives them the truth of the gospel, he preaches Christ. It was a priority for

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:59.820
Paul and those people that got saved. The Bible tells us, I read the passage that

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.700
talked about the ones that believe not, but the Bible says in verse 4 of Acts 17,

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:09.140
and some of them believed. There was a church that was established and that

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:16.380
church, those individual believers, they then made it a priority to preach the

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.500
gospel, to give the truth, to say as the songwriter said, I love to tell the

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:27.100
story. Can I tell you what Jesus did for me? Can I tell you how Jesus changed my

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:33.300
life? Can I tell you how much he loves you and what he'd like to do for you? See,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.780
we recognize the privilege and then we make it a priority. Finally, if you're

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:42.220
taking notes, recognize the power. Recognize the power. Back in Romans

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:49.740
chapter number 1, Paul has said, I am debtor in verse 14. He says in verse

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:57.020
number 15, I am ready. And in verse number 16 he says, for I am not ashamed. I'm not

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:05.860
ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Why? For it, the gospel of Christ, is the power of

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:13.620
God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.500
the Greek. If I could make just a side note statement with regard to verse

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:24.340
number 16, we'll focus upon the power of the gospel and I'm so thankful and it's

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:31.100
so important that we recognize the power, but can I say to you that we need not to

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:38.940
be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. It's becoming more and more common in our

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.179
society that people would say to us, well you shouldn't talk about that and you

00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:51.660
shouldn't share your opinions and so on and so forth. Listen, let's not be ashamed

00:48:51.660 --> 00:49:00.619
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I hope that we would have, even as we've looked

00:49:00.619 --> 00:49:04.780
and traced some things about the Apostle Paul, that we'd have the same

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:10.500
perspective. That we understand the message of the gospel. We understand what

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.500
it's done for us. We understand the privilege that is ours. We've made it a

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.540
priority. See, I'm not gonna be ashamed. I understand that not everyone's gonna

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:27.299
listen to me. I wish everyone would. I wish people understood the, just the

00:49:27.299 --> 00:49:32.780
power of the message that we have and how liberating it is and how important

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:41.380
it is. Listen, there's a world in darkness. They're in darkness. They need what we

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.220
have. I understand that they don't think they need it. I understand they're not

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.940
aware of the fact that they need what we have, but biblically speaking we know

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:58.380
that they do. And this message is powerful. It is the power of God unto

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.059
salvation.

00:50:01.059 --> 00:50:03.419
to everyone that believeth,

00:50:03.419 --> 00:50:07.659
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:50:07.659 --> 00:50:11.879
We read, as we started the book of Colossians,

00:50:11.879 --> 00:50:14.739
on Sunday morning in verse number 6 of chapter 1,

00:50:14.739 --> 00:50:18.039
how that the gospel produces fruit.

00:50:18.039 --> 00:50:19.879
It's powerful.

00:50:19.879 --> 00:50:22.719
We understand, as we would read the truth

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:25.339
and often quote the reference in 2 Corinthians 5

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:26.179
in verse number 17,

00:50:26.179 --> 00:50:28.879
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:31.139
The power of the gospel.

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:36.379
I want you to consider what Paul says in Galatians 1

00:50:37.779 --> 00:50:39.679
about his own testimony.

00:50:39.679 --> 00:50:44.519
And this, of course, is written to the churches in Galatia,

00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:46.179
those churches and those cities

00:50:46.179 --> 00:50:47.619
during the first missionary journey.

00:50:47.619 --> 00:50:50.379
I preached about that a little bit on Sunday evening

00:50:50.379 --> 00:50:51.619
about the church in Antioch

00:50:51.619 --> 00:50:55.319
and how they were used to send forth the first missionaries.

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:58.959
They go to Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe.

00:50:58.959 --> 00:51:00.919
And here in Galatians 1,

00:51:00.919 --> 00:51:04.199
notice what Paul says in verse number 22.

00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:05.339
The Bible says this,

00:51:05.339 --> 00:51:08.680
and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea,

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.319
which were in Christ.

00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:12.799
But that, it says this,

00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:16.159
but they, those believers in Judea,

00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:19.619
they had heard only that He,

00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:23.799
which persecuted us in times past,

00:51:23.799 --> 00:51:27.919
now preacheth the faith

00:51:27.919 --> 00:51:31.119
which once He destroyed,

00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:34.639
and they glorified God in me.

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:38.659
Paul understood the power of the gospel in his own life.

00:51:40.399 --> 00:51:42.319
He knew what Christ did for him.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.559
And I would submit that you know what Christ did for you.

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:50.659
You know the power of the gospel.

00:51:51.779 --> 00:51:53.399
I talk to people sometimes,

00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:56.759
but it's just not, I just can't be saved.

00:51:56.759 --> 00:51:57.799
It's just not for me.

00:51:57.799 --> 00:52:00.439
It's just, you know, you don't know what I've done.

00:52:00.439 --> 00:52:01.839
You don't know what a sinner I am,

00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:02.759
and so on and so forth.

00:52:02.759 --> 00:52:05.040
And I often think of what the songwriter said.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.439
I don't know what a sinner you are,

00:52:06.439 --> 00:52:08.699
but I know what a Savior He is.

00:52:11.239 --> 00:52:14.839
The Apostle Paul testifies

00:52:14.839 --> 00:52:17.300
that He was the chief of all sinners.

00:52:18.639 --> 00:52:20.319
That Christ Jesus came into the world

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:23.679
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

00:52:23.679 --> 00:52:24.779
That's what Paul said.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.919
And we understand the power of the gospel.

00:52:29.919 --> 00:52:33.679
And Paul said, if you know, in verse 23 of Galatians 1,

00:52:33.679 --> 00:52:37.959
if you know the contrast in times past,

00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:41.039
now preacheth the faith.

00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:43.919
What He was and now what He is

00:52:43.919 --> 00:52:45.679
because of the power of the gospel.

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.020
Go back to the book of Acts, if you will.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.699
We'll close here in Acts chapter number nine.

00:52:50.699 --> 00:52:53.459
And I just want to read a few verses to you

00:52:53.459 --> 00:52:55.679
about the conversion of Paul.

00:52:55.679 --> 00:52:57.380
We know that his name is still Saul

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.520
here in Acts chapter number nine.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.300
It would be changed to Paul in Acts chapter number 13

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.639
during that first missionary journey.

00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:08.380
And here in Acts nine, we read of the conversion.

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.860
And I want to read a couple of verses

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.779
at the beginning of Acts nine,

00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:14.099
and then I'm going to skip to verse number 20.

00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:16.000
And I want you to see the difference.

00:53:16.039 --> 00:53:18.679
It says in verse number one of Acts nine,

00:53:18.679 --> 00:53:22.000
and Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.440
against the disciples of the Lord,

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.080
went unto the high priest

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.679
and desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues,

00:53:29.679 --> 00:53:31.839
that if he found any of this way,

00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:33.639
whether they were men or women,

00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:37.500
he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.599
Paul was going with a mission.

00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:45.679
He was trying to stamp out

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.580
these that were following Christ.

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:53.919
We'll skip the next several verses

00:53:53.919 --> 00:53:57.319
that rehearse for us and record for us his conversion,

00:53:57.319 --> 00:53:59.279
because I want you to see what the Bible tells us

00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:01.699
in verse number 19 and 20.

00:54:01.699 --> 00:54:04.959
It says, and when he, Paul, Saul,

00:54:04.959 --> 00:54:06.919
that is his name here at this time,

00:54:06.919 --> 00:54:10.959
when he had received me, he was strengthened,

00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:13.279
then with Saul certain days with the disciples

00:54:13.279 --> 00:54:15.559
which were at Damascus,

00:54:15.559 --> 00:54:20.559
and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.600
that he is the Son of God.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.239
What happened to this man, Saul?

00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:29.260
I mean, he's breathing out threatenings.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.399
I mean, he's ready to go to Damascus.

00:54:31.399 --> 00:54:34.679
He's received letters in order to have the authority

00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:37.880
to arrest those that would be of this way,

00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:40.799
that he could take them and bring them bound

00:54:40.799 --> 00:54:45.040
back to Jerusalem, and yet then we find

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.000
that he's preaching Christ in the synagogues,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.639
that he is the Son of God.

00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:54.079
Well, the Gospel's powerful.

00:54:55.399 --> 00:55:00.119
Along the way on the road to Damascus,

00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:02.559
there was a bright light that shined from heaven.

00:55:03.399 --> 00:55:08.399
And here's a voice, Saul, Saul,

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.160
why persecutest thou me?

00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:18.000
And Saul says, who art thou, Lord?

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.399
Jesus says, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

00:55:25.519 --> 00:55:30.519
And Saul would then say, Lord, he, Lord,

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.880
what wilt thou have me to do?

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.279
He recognized that Jesus is Lord.

00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:41.119
In fact, the Bible tells us Paul would be used of God

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:44.279
to pen the words in the book of Philippians

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.320
that we've often mentioned, that in the name of Jesus,

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.919
every knee should bow, things in heaven,

00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:51.440
and things in earth, and things under the earth,

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.440
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.760
to the glory of God the Father.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.839
Saul confessed that in Acts 9.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.480
He understood the power of the Gospel.

00:56:05.919 --> 00:56:08.200
Why is it that we love to tell the story?

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.359
Well, it's a privilege.

00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:14.919
I am debtor.

00:56:14.919 --> 00:56:16.440
I'm allowed of God.

00:56:18.639 --> 00:56:22.000
We need to make it a priority to tell the story.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.440
We need to plan to do so.

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:28.079
This year, maybe after this message,

00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:32.160
you should sit down and ask the Lord to help you

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.720
to devise a plan on how you're gonna get the Gospel out.

00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:39.359
Maybe when you come to church on Sunday,

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:43.160
you need to grab a handful of Gospel tracts.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.160
We have them in our lobby,

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.720
available for you to take and distribute.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.320
Maybe you wanna take some John and Romans this year

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.600
and share them with your neighbors.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.239
However the Lord might impress upon your heart,

00:56:57.239 --> 00:56:59.040
but make it a priority.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.320
Plan to get the Gospel out,

00:57:03.919 --> 00:57:06.519
and then recognize the power of the Gospel.

00:57:07.679 --> 00:57:09.720
What did it do for you?

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.079
Changed my life.

00:57:14.239 --> 00:57:18.359
The day in my life when my direction changed entirely,

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.799
just as it did for Saul in Acts 9.

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.639
I didn't go and straightway preach the Gospel

00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:25.919
as quickly as he did,

00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:28.399
but my life was changed.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.040
It was a new creature because of the power of the Gospel.

00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:39.679
And we understand that the Gospel has the power

00:57:39.919 --> 00:57:42.679
still today to change lives.

00:57:44.519 --> 00:57:46.679
Jesus saves, we sing the song.

00:57:46.679 --> 00:57:49.000
And what a great song it is.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.119
Jesus saves, he does.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.440
But they need to know about the Savior.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.160
Oh, that God would help us

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.959
to take the Gospel to every creature.

00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:01.679
Father, we love you.

00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:02.799
We thank you for loving us.

00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:03.880
We thank you for the privilege,

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.799
once again, of studying your Word.

00:58:05.799 --> 00:58:09.959
What a joy to have the Bible.

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:15.160
I pray, God, that you would help us

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.440
as we consider the content of this message.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.440
Help us to recognize the privilege

00:58:26.679 --> 00:58:29.119
of sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:58:29.119 --> 00:58:31.440
Help us, God, to make it a priority.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.320
Help us to recognize the power

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.239
of this message that we proclaim.

00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:41.400
I pray that as you would work in our hearts individually

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.000
and as a church corporately,

00:58:44.279 --> 00:58:46.919
God, we would see many souls saved this year.

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:54.080
I pray that you'd move and work as only you can.

00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:57.039
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:58:57.039 --> 00:58:58.479
Amen.
