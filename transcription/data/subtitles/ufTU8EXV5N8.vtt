00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Scripture here.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Trust me, a blessing to you, 1 Peter 1 and verses 6 through 9, I'll be focused there,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.800
but I really want to, before we even get to those particular verses, I want to start looking

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.439
at verses 3 through 5 by way of introduction.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.840
I want you to notice, of course, Peter in this book, if you're familiar with 1 Peter,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.559
he's writing to those that are scattered abroad because of the persecution that they're enduring.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:31.680
But I want you to notice how the Apostle Peter seeks to encourage these brethren.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.599
And notice what he says in verse number 3,

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:40.520
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.599
mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:49.599
the dead.

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:50.599
You know what he's telling them?

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:51.799
You've been saved.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.000
You've been born again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.959
You've been redeemed through the precious blood of Christ.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.279
You have been begotten, born again.

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.400
Verse 4, notice what he tells them here.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.720
To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720
for you.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
Isn't that wonderful?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.319
An inheritance, but he says this, that it's incorruptible, it's undefiled, it's fading

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.959
not away, and it's reserved in heaven for you.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.639
I mean, that's wonderful, isn't it?

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.480
I mean, praise God.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.760
Verse number 5, look at what he tells them here.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.319
He says, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.800
revealed in the last time.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
Aren't you thankful that we're kept by the power of God?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.400
Amen?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.519
Listen, I'm glad I don't have to keep my own salvation, amen?

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.239
You couldn't earn your own salvation.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.879
You can't keep your own salvation.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.599
A preacher said this, if it was on me to keep my salvation, I'd have lost it right after

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.919
I got it, amen?

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:53.919
And here's the deal.

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:58.559
We're kept by the power of God, so I want you to notice what Peter says to these believers

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:00.279
in verses 3 through 5.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.239
He says, listen, you're saved.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.400
Isn't that wonderful?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.119
I mean, just even if he didn't give us verse 4 and 5, I mean, just stop there.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.119
You're saved.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.119
You're going to heaven.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.119
Amen?

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.679
Listen, I know sometimes we can live under the circumstances and it seems like, man,

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.919
all this crazy stuff, but we're going to heaven.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.320
I heard a preacher say this, on your worst day and on my worst day, I mean, as terrible,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.559
as awful as it could possibly be, you're not going to hell.

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:31.559
You're saved.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.160
Isn't that awesome?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.800
We need to be reminded of that.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
He says you're saved.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.960
He says this, that you have an inheritance.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.000
He says this, that you're kept by the power of God.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.039
And he begins verse number 6 by saying this, wherein ye greatly rejoice.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.639
The truth that is revealed, the truths, I should say, that are revealed to us in verses

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.119
3, 4, and 5 should cause us as the people of God to greatly rejoice.

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:05.279
It should cause us, listen, to rejoice greatly, to understand that our names are written in

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.520
the book of life, to understand that no matter what we might face, no matter what we might

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.600
deal with, upon this earth, that I'm going to heaven.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
Amen?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.800
We sing with the kids, I'm going to heaven, can't wait, gonna see Jesus, can't wait.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.839
But some of us, we don't live like that every day, right?

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.600
We're not mindful of these truths every day.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.360
He says wherein, based upon the truth that I've just shared with you, ye greatly rejoice.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.800
And then it says this, though now for a season.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:55.039
Though now for a season, notice this, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:04:01.279
The trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:07.080
tried with fire, might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080
Christ.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.759
He's going to appear, he's coming back.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.639
Notice verse 8, whom having not seen, ye love.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.559
You've not seen him, but ye love him.

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.480
Why do you love him?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.200
Because he first loved me, right?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.519
I love him because he first loved me.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:28.040
We sing about loving the Lord, we talk about loving him, and here Peter says you've not

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.839
seen him, but ye love him, and whom though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:41.720
with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720
of your souls.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.880
See, the reality is that right there in verses 6 and 7, we sometimes don't like living there.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.920
We don't like that season that Peter is referring to here, but I want you to understand that

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.359
as we notice in verse number 6, where it transitions from wherein ye greatly rejoice,

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:09.959
though now for a season if need be, you're in heaviness through manifold temptations,

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.040
and he says this, the trial of your faith.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.239
If you're taking notes, I've simply entitled the message this evening, The Trial of Your

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:17.519
Faith.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.079
There are some times in our lives that maybe we would be tempted to ask a question such

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:24.679
as this, why trials?

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.079
Why in the world do we have to deal with these things?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:35.720
Now I would submit to you that even as I was meditating and just preparing this message

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.000
for this evening, that I was mindful of the fact that really any trial that I've endured

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.519
is really not much of anything to even discuss.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:52.160
When I think about the trials that our brothers and sisters around the world that are currently

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.040
going through, when I read about trials that our brothers and sisters that have gone before

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.320
us have endured, when I read about the Apostle Paul and think of some of his trials, that

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.760
which I have endured, and I would probably say that which many of you have endured, are

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.679
really not even kind of showing up on the map, so to speak.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:17.839
But we find that there are times in our lives that our faith is tested.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.600
We have the trial of our faith.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.399
I want you to understand really at the onset of the thought tonight that the truth that

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.720
is given to us in verses 3, 4, and 5, those truths that are mentioned there, that they

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.679
are secure and they are eternal.

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:39.640
No one's going to take your salvation from you.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.640
He says that we have an inheritance.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.079
Notice how he describes it.

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:48.359
Incorruptible, undefiled, fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:50.320
That's pretty awesome, isn't it?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.920
We're kept by the power of God.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.040
These truths that are given here, they are secure and they are eternal.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.880
However, when we would contrast the truths that are given to us in verses 3 and 5 versus

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.440
the trial of our faith that is mentioned in the next section of this passage, we would

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.600
find that the trial is simply temporary.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.559
It's temporary.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.279
And I would say this, it's necessary.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.279
It's necessary.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:20.640
And we'll get into that in just a moment.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.839
But I really want you to think about the contrast between eternal and temporary.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:31.440
We find that there are times, no doubt, that we might be dealing with a particular trial

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.239
and we think it's been going on for a lengthy period of time and we say, how long?

00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:37.880
One thing that I know is it won't be forever.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.399
Amen?

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.519
It won't be forever.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:45.239
And that should cause us to rejoice.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:49.839
As we look at this passage of Scripture and really just kind of consider some thoughts

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:55.559
this evening, someone said this with regard to the trial of our faith, a faith that cannot

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.600
be tested is a faith that cannot be trusted.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.279
And I thought that was pretty powerful to consider it in that way.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:09.119
A trial, the word that is used here in verse number 7, the trial of your faith, it's a

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.040
unique word and it really carries with it the idea of proving.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.160
It carries with it this idea, that by which something is tried or proved, a test.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.519
Now I remember being in school and going through, you know, elementary school and middle school,

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:28.720
high school, and you have tests, right, and many times you don't really enjoy tests a

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720
whole lot.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.239
But as I kind of got older and in those finishing up high school years and into college, I realized

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:38.400
something about tests.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.880
Tests are actually helpful.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.960
Sometimes we dread a test, but you know, a test reveals some things.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.080
A test reveals what we know and what we don't know.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.960
Sometimes we get so caught up in a test and what the score, what did I get on my test,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.239
where did I place, what was my, but the reality is that a test is going to reveal some things

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:08.559
to us of what we know and what we don't know, and if we take the test properly and then

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:13.400
we respond to whatever it is that we find out, one of the responses that we would have

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.919
to a test is, okay, I got an 80 on this, then that means there's 20% of the material.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.799
I need to go study and find out more.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:22.599
I need to learn more.

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:30.960
I need to focus in these areas on these things, and what a blessing to have that revealed

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
to us.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.000
And so I believe that a test has purpose, and no doubt that is the truth when we look

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.599
at the trial, the testing of our faith.

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:41.719
I would ask this, just a couple of thoughts tonight.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:44.239
Number one, what is your perspective?

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:45.239
What is your perspective?

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:50.479
When a trial comes into your life, when a trial comes into my life, what is our perspective

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:51.679
of that trial?

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.760
How do we view it?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.880
What is our immediate response to that particular trial?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.960
Because I believe that perspective matters.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560
I believe this evening that if we can gain some truth

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.480
from not only this couple of verses in 1 Peter 1,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.440
but we'll look at a few other verses throughout this book

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.960
and a couple of other places,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.560
I believe that we can have a perspective

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.400
that will help us get the results

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.800
that we're supposed to get from the trial.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.920
Number one under this thought is what is your perspective?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.400
I want you to think about this.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.560
I mentioned it already, they are temporary.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.400
They're temporary.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.520
Notice in verse number six, it says this,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.520
wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.080
How many times you read the Bible

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.240
and the word of God, it says, and it came to pass.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.440
And there was one fellow that was asked,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.000
they were having this discussion

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.720
of what your favorite Bible verse is.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.360
And he raised his hand and said,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.800
preacher, my favorite Bible verse is it came to pass.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.920
And the preacher said, I'm not really sure I know

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.080
which one you're talking about.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.720
And he said, oh, you see it all over the place.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.560
It came to pass.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.040
It didn't come to stay.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.240
And I thought it was pretty good, amen.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.200
And the reality is that you notice what it says here,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.120
though for a season, but then turn over

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.080
to chapter number five of 1 Peter,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.040
and look at chapter number five, look at verse number 10.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.060
Notice what Peter says as he's concluding this book,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.900
this letter to these believers

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.040
that he's seeking to encourage.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.720
He says this, but the God of all grace

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.800
who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.600
Again, notice the eternal perspective.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.080
The fact that we've been saved,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.600
he's called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600
Notice this, after that ye have suffered a while.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.960
Again, it's a while.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.860
I don't know how long a while is.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.280
You don't know how long a while is, but it's not forever.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.780
It's temporary, it's temporary.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.760
And if I can gain that perspective

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.880
when I think about the trial that I might be facing,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.760
the trial that you might be facing,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.960
that if I can understand it within the context

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.840
that this is an eternal, I have some wonderful promises

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.980
with regard to eternity and some eternal things,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.600
but this here, this is just temporary.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.440
This is going to pass.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.520
Number two, when I think about the perspective,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.360
I would say this, trials are necessary.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.700
You say, I beg to differ.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.400
I'm sure many of us, when we have that trial,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.720
that's probably not our first response.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.120
Oh man, I must need this today, this is wonderful.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.880
That's probably not how we respond.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.660
But I'm trying to help myself

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.920
and hope to help someone else tonight as well.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.240
Notice what it says in verse number six.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.520
Though now for a season, if need be.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.620
Who is it that determines if it's necessary?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.040
Not you, God.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.120
And can I say this?

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.360
God knows what we need.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.360
He knows exactly what we need.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.000
He knows when we need it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.160
He knows our frame.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.280
He knows we're but dust.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.800
He's created us.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.320
And so He knows what we need, when we need it.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.320
He knows how much we need, right?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.480
He knows.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.200
And so when we think about this tonight

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.240
and we think about this truth of if need be

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.200
and trying to form my perspective with regard to trials,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm mindful of what it says in Psalm 66 10.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.720
For thou, O God, hast proved us.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.720
Thou hast tried us as silver is tried.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.480
It's God that does this work in our hearts and our lives.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.680
And we see that it's temporary.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.520
We notice that it's necessary.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.160
I would say this.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.880
Trials, they're common.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.320
They're common.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.880
Notice what it says in first Peter four.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.760
It's interesting.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.520
It's a different word that is used here

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.680
to describe the trial that is being mentioned here.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.960
And of course, it says a fiery trial

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.120
and that's just one word in the Greek.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.200
It's a very, again, an interesting word.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.560
But I want you to notice that Peter's saying

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.880
to these believers, he says, beloved,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.160
think it not strange concerning the fiery trial

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.520
which is to try you as though some strange thing

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.240
happened unto you.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.080
As I look at that truth in verse number 12,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.880
I say, look it, this isn't a strange thing

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.720
that's happened to us.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.560
This is a common thing.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.960
It's something that we deal with in life.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.720
We have these trials.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.840
And we find that after revealing this truth

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.320
to these believers, he then says,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.920
but rejoice, in verse number 13,

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.880
inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.440
that when his glory shall be revealed,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.000
ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.200
He says, if you be reproached for the name of Christ,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200
notice this, happy are ye.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.480
Happy are ye.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.360
If a man suffers a Christian, in verse number 16,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.440
it says, let him not be ashamed,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.760
but let him glorify God on this behalf.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.480
And so we find that these trials,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.080
that when we try to form our perspective

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.680
with regard to trials, that we say they're temporary,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.800
they're necessary, they're common.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.200
I want you to consider the example of Paul.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.640
Keep your place here in 1 Peter,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.640
but turn over to 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.600
if you will.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.560
And after we read part of this verse,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.520
I want you to hold your spot here again

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.680
because we'll come back at the end

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.160
to this verse of Scripture as well.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.640
But I want you to notice the perspective

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.320
of the Apostle Paul.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.600
And of course, we don't have time this evening

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.080
to discuss all of the things that Paul suffered

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.360
and that he dealt with.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.080
But we understand, if you wanna jot down in your notes,

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.760
you can look back over later to 2 Corinthians 11,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.240
really, verses 22 down through verse number 30,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.640
and just see all of the things that Paul endured.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.840
And as you think about his missionary journeys

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.760
and his endeavors as he was serving the Lord,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.960
all that he dealt with,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.960
and yet he says this in verse 16 of 2 Corinthians 4,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.560
for which cause we faint not,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.600
but though our outward man perish,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.920
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.920
Notice verse 17, for our light affliction,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.080
which is but for a moment.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.720
So he calls it a light affliction,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.640
and then he says that it's only for a moment.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.960
Again, we talked about there being temporary.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.720
If need be, it says, though for a season, if need be.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.520
It says that after you've suffered a while.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.840
Listen, when we think about eternity

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.840
in light of our lives, it really is just that long.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.240
I mean, our entire life in view of eternity, right?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.960
If you live 70 years, if you live 100 years,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.680
somebody said to me the other day,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.600
they wanna live to be 102.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.880
I don't know how in the world they got the number 102,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.720
but they came up with 102,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.800
and they told me they wanna live to be 102,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.360
and look, I don't wanna live to be 102.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.360
I'm just being honest with you.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.520
I'd rather just go to heaven, amen?

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.280
But the reality is that they said they wanna be 102.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.240
Listen, if they live to be 102,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.960
it's just that long with regard to eternity.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.560
So how long is the trial within the 102 years,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.160
or the 70 years, or how many years God gives us?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.840
The trial's even shorter than the life.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.280
It's just a moment.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.960
Now, we're living in it, so we feel like it's forever, right?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.320
When is this gonna ever end?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.920
When am I gonna get relief?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.840
I understand.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.200
But again, we're trying to gain this perspective of trials.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.160
And as we look at 1 Peter, and really the whole of the book,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.160
and then look at the example of Paul,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.000
I believe that it will help us to have this perspective

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.320
that would enable us to endure the trials

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.320
in the manner in which we ought to,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.080
so that, number two in your notes,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.760
what is it that trials produce?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.280
What is our perspective, but then what do trials produce?

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.400
And see, I want the trial, if I understand properly,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.720
as I mentioned a moment ago about test,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.640
that tests have a purpose.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.080
Trials have a purpose, amen?

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.280
And there's a purpose in that trial,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.320
and if I understand the purpose,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.800
and I understand that God's trying

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.680
to produce something in me,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.800
he's trying to produce something in you,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.000
then that's going to my perspective

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.320
and my understanding of that,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.640
then I say, well, what is it that it produces?

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.920
1 Peter chapter number one, where we started,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.559
notice in verse number seven, as he begins,

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.480
he says that the trial of your faith,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.320
notice how he describes the trial of our faith,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.320
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.000
Now, remember, he's talking about,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
verses three through five, the eternal perspective, right?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.040
These truths that he's given to us,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.040
and then he says, listen, the trial of your faith,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.800
it's more precious, it's much more precious

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.160
than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.840
and he's talking about that gold

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.240
that's been tried with fire

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.400
and just the preciousness of that gold,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.040
but then as he makes that comparison to our faith

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.240
as it's being tried, he says that it might be found

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.800
unto praise and honor and glory

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.920
at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.920
I believe the first thing that a trial produces,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.760
it refines us, it refines us.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.800
We look at that trial, that fiery trial

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.280
that is mentioned in 1 Peter four in verse number 12,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.800
and that literally carries with it the idea

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.679
it would be used in the context of a refiner's fire.

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:41.559
That Greek word would be used in that context,

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.880
and these individuals, they understood what that was.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.360
Some of us have never perhaps seen and witnessed

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.679
the process of refining metal

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:53.280
and seeing how they go through that process

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.040
to get the impurities out.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.920
We think about the word of God,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.960
and as God says in Psalm 12,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.960
of God as silver tried in a furnace seven times, and speaking of the purity,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.120
and we find that maybe we've not encountered that or seen that, it's a

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.960
it's a really exciting study to see how all that stuff works, but God is refining

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:21.720
us. That's awesome. That he has enough interest in us to refine us. Here's what

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.840
Job says, now you think about Job, he had some difficulties, did he not? You read

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:35.040
Job chapter number one. Wow. Wow. As one servant is speaking, telling about a

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.120
calamity, another one's coming to tell about the next thing, right? You ever been

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.120
in a position where you say, I don't want any more news today. I mean look, it's all

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.880
been, I just can't handle it, no more. Wait until another day. Yeah, that was Job, he

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.040
didn't say that, but that's how it was working out, but notice what he says as

00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:00.320
he's replying to Eliphaz in Job 23 10, he says this, but you know it the

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:10.560
way that I take, when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. When he, God,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:21.000
hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. See, he refines us. What is it that's

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.480
produced, that refining? I believe that what is produced also is patience. Notice

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.960
in James chapter number one, the Bible says there in James 1, talking about the

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.440
the trial, of course, that is being dealt with here to start this particular book

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.040
in James chapter 1 verse 2, my brethren, count it all joy when you fall into

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.920
diverse temptations, knowing this. You know there's some things God wants us to

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.800
know, right? Why? Because that knowing something helps our perspective and

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.720
helps us to be able to endure it, and we're noticing here, again, it really

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.400
could kind of go all together with our perspective because we're knowledgeable

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.480
of these things, and it helps us to endure them in a proper way. He says in

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.040
verse number three, knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.240
The trying of your faith worketh patience. I believe also that it produces

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.400
maturity. Go back to first Peter, if you will, chapter number five. First Peter

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.800
chapter number five. These are interconnected, no doubt, when you speak

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.840
about the refining and you speak about the maturity. In first Peter chapter

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.360
number five, we read part of verse number ten a moment ago, speaking about the fact

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.800
that trials are temporary. The Bible says, but the God of all grace who hath called

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.240
us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:52.400
while, notice this, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. I

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.520
believe that's maturity. If I could take all of those words and sum it up in one

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.880
word, I would say it's spiritual maturity. When we think about the spiritual

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.880
maturity, you know, the believers in Corinth, Paul says to them, I can't speak

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.760
to you as unto spiritual, I have to speak to you as unto carnal. You're

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.960
babes in Christ. Now, it's one thing to be a babe in Christ because you just got

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:21.640
saved. That's normal, that's acceptable. You're to grow in grace, amen,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.240
desire the sincere milk of the Lord that you may grow thereby, but it's a problem

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.640
when you're Hebrews chapter number five context, and in the time that you ought

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.200
to be teachers, you have need that one teach you, they're still babes in Christ.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.080
They were supposed to be at a place where they had matured spiritually. Can I

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.320
tell you that as we have this proper perspective of trials, that we'd

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.040
understand again that these trials are working in us, that are producing in us

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.280
this spiritual maturity, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:03.600
establish, strengthen, settle you. Wow, that's spiritual maturity, and we find

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.000
this evening that as we would look at the the truth that Peter is given to

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.120
these believers in 1st Peter, and we've kind of scattered through a couple of

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.800
thoughts in a couple of different chapters here, and we noticed that Peter

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.200
is trying to encourage these believers. They were going through some real

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:27.760
difficult times. I want to use the example of Paul once again in closing. I

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.600
asked you to keep your spot there in 2nd Corinthians chapter number four, and

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.480
again we read part of that verse in verse number 17, and he said that our

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.960
light affliction, which is but for a moment, and again having that

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:47.320
understanding that these trials are temporary and really they're just a

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.720
light affliction, notice what he says, notice how he describes it in verse

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720
number 17 at the end,

00:24:52.720 --> 00:25:03.800
"...worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.680
not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen." So the

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.400
things which are seen are temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.560
You know, as human beings, it's a whole lot easier for us to focus on the trial,

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:25.560
on the temporary, than it is for us to focus on the promises, the eternal, that

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.160
Peter prefaced that section with in 1st Peter 1. Why? Because the trial is in our

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.360
face, it's something that we're dealing with, it's something that we're going

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.840
through. But while we look not at these things which are temporal, these things

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.920
which are seen, we're having that eternal perspective. I think about those in

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.960
various places around the world, of course at this particular time we think

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.640
of those that are in Afghanistan, it's the biggest thing kind of that we're

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.400
faced with right now, as far as looking at someone that's facing a real serious

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.880
situation, a trial, that quite frankly I don't think any of us can really

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.760
relate to. I just can't, I can't. I can't relate to someone knocking on my door to

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.240
find out if I have a Bible or if I have a Bible app on my phone for the purpose

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.880
of imprisoning or killing me. I can't understand that. We've been spoiled in

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.680
America, we really have. And sometimes we got a little something going on and

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.800
we're like, oh man I have such a huge trial, and then something like this

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.240
happens on the world stage and it helps us to kind of re-evaluate things and say

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.880
you know what it really isn't that bad. And we have this perspective, listen

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.600
it's easy for us to get into the weeds, so to speak, when we're dealing with a

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.640
trial. But I hope tonight that as we do just a brief study of these verses of

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.080
Scripture and the the truth that that Peter is seeking to encourage these

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.360
believers with, that it would help us to have a perspective of trials that would

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.680
help us to properly endure them so that we could see these things produced in

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:10.840
our lives. God uses trials to produce things in our lives. No doubt there are

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.600
times in which we would think, oh I wish everything would just be so easy and I'd

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:20.560
never have any problems and everything would just work. But we become very

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:28.520
independent in a state like that, do we not? And Jesus said without me you can do

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.840
nothing. And so there are times in which he brings us to a place, through a trial

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.520
perhaps, where we understand in a greater way how much we need him. And we learn

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:47.480
things about him that otherwise we would not have learned. The trial of your faith.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.280
Oh that God would help us to develop a perspective that would be biblical, that

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.240
would help produce in us what God desires to produce. Let's pray. Father we

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.560
love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the work that you do in

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.320
our hearts and lives. We thank you that you know what we need, when we need, how

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.440
much we need. We thank you that it's just for a season, just for a little while.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.960
Though we do not know the specified period of time, we can rejoice in knowing

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.880
that it's not forever. God would you help us to be mindful of the promises, the

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.920
truths that were given in verses 3 through 5 with regard to the fact that

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.440
we're saved and we have an inheritance and that we're kept by the power of God.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:39.640
What a blessing to be mindful of the fact that on our worst day, when the

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:46.520
worst of circumstances, that the second death hath no power over us. Pray that you

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.720
bless our time of prayer. Thank you for the privilege. I pray that you'd

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.480
encourage us as we read about the missionaries. Help us to pray

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.119
appropriately for these missionaries. Help us to pray one for another as we

00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:04.240
fulfill the truth that you've given us in your word, to pray one for another.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.600
And Lord, we thank you that you hear and answer prayer, that you're able to do

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.920
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. Bless now and we'll thank

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.720
you for it. In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.360
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin?
