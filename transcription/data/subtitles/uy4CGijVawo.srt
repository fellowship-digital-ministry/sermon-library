1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
is in verse number four this evening.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,559
And of course, you know that on Wednesday evenings

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,639
for a number of weeks now, we have taken our time

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,279
going through these first few verses of Luke chapter number

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,279
11 and dealing with this request from the disciple

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,239
when he said, Lord, teach us to pray.

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,079
The very beginning lesson from this portion of Scripture,

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,399
I made the statement that of all the things

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,879
the disciple could have asked the Lord to teach them

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,279
or him, he said, Lord, teach us to pray.

11
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:36,520
And I've made mention throughout this mini series

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,900
from this portion of Scripture, how we need a revival,

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,400
a prayer revival in our lives, individually in our homes,

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,200
our families, our churches, we need a revival of prayer.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,599
I'm thankful to report that God still hears

16
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,159
and answers prayer and that he is able to do

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,400
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,479
And what a great privilege, a unique privilege

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,800
for the child of God to enter into the very throne room

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,919
of heaven into the presence of God

21
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:09,080
and worship him through prayer.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,339
And of course, make our petitions known.

23
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:12,959
Of course, as we've studied through this,

24
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,720
we've understood that the disciple made the request

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,319
and the response of the Lord Jesus Christ

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,239
begins to teach all of the disciples.

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,839
He said unto them, when ye pray.

28
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:25,480
In other words, it was an assumed practice,

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,599
an expectation that the people of God

30
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,160
would be people of prayer.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,440
He didn't say if you pray, he said when you pray.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,160
And we understand that it's certainly a privilege of ours

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,919
as he then says, say our Father.

34
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,739
We think about the relationship that we have

35
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,239
with the God of heaven is because of that relationship

36
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,819
that we have access, the very throne room of God.

37
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,239
And this evening, we understand that he is

38
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,440
the Lord God omnipotent, that he rules and reigns,

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,199
that he's the creator and sustainer of all things.

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,800
And yet, we have a relationship with him.

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,040
And what a great reminder, even as we enter

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,440
into our time of prayer, we think that we'd understand

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
as we go through verse number two

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,160
that there would be an attitude of reverence.

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Hallowed be thy name.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,320
The holiness of God is in full view

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,919
and understanding who he is

48
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,119
and understanding that we enter in with this spirit,

49
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,320
this attitude of reverence.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,960
And then, the attitude of submission.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,399
We dealt with not only having an attitude of reverence,

52
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,800
but an attitude of submission.

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,080
When he said, thy kingdom come,

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,160
thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
Last Wednesday evening, we looked at verse number three

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
and we dealt with the fact that our God is the provider.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,360
We understand that in Genesis chapter number 22,

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,160
God will make himself known to Abraham

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,880
as Jehovah Jireh, the God who provides,

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
the Lord who provides.

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,880
And I'm so thankful that as our shepherd,

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,520
he's a good shepherd and he provides for us.

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
And we looked at that in verse number three.

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,800
This evening, as we look at verse number four,

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,119
if you're taking notes,

66
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,880
I just simply want to title the message tonight,

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,039
Prayer of Repentance.

68
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,240
Prayer of Repentance.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,479
Notice with me that the Bible says,

70
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,520
and forgive us our sins.

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,080
And forgive us our sins.

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Again, as I've made known throughout this mini series,

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,199
this is not a prayer that is to be just memorized

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,820
and mindlessly repeated throughout the day,

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,360
perhaps multiple times a day.

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,919
That's not the idea.

77
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,199
Really, Jesus is giving us a model or framework for prayer.

78
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,000
This prayer that is mentioned here,

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
this model or framework of prayer,

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,360
you find that though the New Testament

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,759
will record a number of God's people praying,

82
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,080
never will you find this repeated verbatim.

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,759
And so we find that it is not just this idea

84
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,360
when we see this forgive us our sins,

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,759
that it's just, Lord, if I sin, forgive me.

86
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,320
It's really not the idea.

87
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,199
Again, framework for prayer.

88
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,679
As I think about this phrase in verse number four

89
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,720
that begins, and forgive us our sins,

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,359
this prayer of repentance,

91
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,880
I really see two things that it makes us aware of.

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,559
Number one, if you're taking notes,

93
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,920
there's an awareness of our sinfulness.

94
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,079
An awareness of our sinfulness.

95
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,359
The reality is that I am thankful this evening to be saved.

96
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,760
Amen?

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,320
What a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,559
as your personal Savior.

99
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,640
What a joy to know that you're forgiven.

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,160
We'll sing songs about being forgiven.

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,239
I'm redeemed.

102
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,119
I'm forgiven forever.

103
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,200
And we think about that wonderful truth.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,359
And with salvation certainly comes

105
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,359
a deliverance from the penalty of sin

106
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,480
and a deliverance from the power of sin.

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,040
Sin no longer has dominion over us.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
And I'm thankful for that.

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,559
But the reality is that each of us

110
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,359
that are still here have the flesh.

111
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,079
And we still sin.

112
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,799
And we sin daily.

113
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:11,119
The reality is that we are in this body, in this flesh.

114
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,600
We know that the Bible tells us

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,839
that the spirit and the flesh

116
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,279
that are at enmity one with the other.

117
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,239
And we're to walk in the spirit

118
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:21,279
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh,

119
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,720
according to Galatians chapter number five.

120
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,320
But as we think about this phrase

121
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,720
in verse number four of Luke 11,

122
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,640
we find that it just reminds us,

123
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,519
it gives us this awareness of our sinfulness.

124
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,160
And yet one day, thankfully,

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,359
as we look at the whole of the scriptures,

126
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,040
we will be in heaven.

127
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,359
We'll be separated.

128
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,760
We'll have a glorified body.

129
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
No more sin.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,799
And what a wonderful day that will be.

131
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,440
But until then, we still struggle with this area of sin.

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,640
There is a common teaching that is out there.

133
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not really anything new.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,079
It's certainly in recent years, I would say,

135
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,559
has gained a lot of traction

136
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:04,480
within a certain contingency of people.

137
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,600
And it's a teaching known as antinomianism.

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,720
And really this idea in which we're under grace,

139
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,760
and so therefore there's really no need

140
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,519
for us to even think about sin

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,079
or confess sin because we've been forgiven.

142
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,519
And so therefore, we're not under the law,

143
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,559
we're under grace,

144
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,720
and so we don't even have to think about it

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,320
because we're forgiven.

146
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,720
In fact, one of the leaders of that particular idea

147
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,200
from yesteryear made the statement

148
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,519
that God would forgive us

149
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,079
because that's his duty, his responsibility.

150
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,399
When you look at the framework here of this model prayer,

151
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,920
and Jesus says, say, our Father which art in heaven,

152
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,320
we've studied all those phrases,

153
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:48,000
and forgive us our sins.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,760
There's this awareness of our sinfulness.

155
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,880
The reality is that we would find

156
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,720
that as we look at the Old Testament,

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,880
and I'm so thankful not to live

158
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,720
under the Old Testament era,

159
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,040
but in the Old Testament,

160
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,079
there was a regular reminder of sin.

161
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,920
What was that?

162
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Well, there was an offering,

163
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,399
a sacrifice that was made regularly.

164
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,079
And depending on those sins of omission,

165
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,239
sins of commission,

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,839
there are all sorts of things.

167
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,119
We often think about the Ten Commandments,

168
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,679
but the law in its broader sense

169
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,959
had many more points than just the Ten Commandments.

170
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,880
And you would find in the Old Testament,

171
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
if you'd study through,

172
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,920
and you'd look at all of those truths that are related,

173
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
is that there would be certain offerings

174
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,760
that would be required based on certain sins

175
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,160
that would be committed.

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,040
And so there was a regular reminder.

177
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
You think about the truth

178
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,559
of the Old Testament priest

179
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,640
and the way in which they daily ministered

180
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,200
and all of these offerings and sacrifices.

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
You go to the tabernacle and you find

182
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,399
the brazen altar, the first piece of furniture

183
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,279
that you would come to,

184
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,239
and the offering being required.

185
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:00,320
And we find that there would be that daily reminder

186
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,480
for the people of God of their sinfulness

187
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,119
and that sin costs something.

188
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,920
In the New Testament,

189
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,480
I am so thankful that Jesus paid it all.

190
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,679
That He said, it is finished.

191
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:19,679
We often speak about that many religions

192
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,160
of the world will say do,

193
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,279
but the biblical Christianity says done.

194
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,480
For Jesus paid it all.

195
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,160
He said, it is finished.

196
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,159
And I'm so thankful for that truth.

197
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,799
When we think about the reality

198
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,320
as New Testament believers,

199
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
if we're not careful,

200
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,640
we can get into a pattern

201
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
in which we're not mindful,

202
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,760
aware of our sinfulness

203
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,880
and the way that it can hinder

204
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,679
our fellowship with God.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,440
See, sin in the life of a believer

206
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,760
is something in which needs to be confessed

207
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,039
as we find here and forgive us our sins.

208
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,960
Why?

209
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,080
Well, we understand that sin hinders our fellowship.

210
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,239
In fact, if you look at 1 John 1,

211
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,640
if you hold your place there in Luke

212
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
and turn over there,

213
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,719
and 1 John 1,

214
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,640
I want you to notice,

215
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,400
beginning in verse number five

216
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
of this portion of Scripture,

217
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,080
we find that John says in 1 John 1,

218
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,239
beginning in verse number five,

219
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,760
this then is the message

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,840
which we have heard of Him

221
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,080
and declare unto you that God is light

222
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,359
and in Him is no darkness at all.

223
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:35,679
If we say that we have fellowship with Him

224
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,479
and walk in darkness,

225
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,599
we lie and do not the truth.

226
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,440
But, if we walk in the light

227
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,960
as He is in the light,

228
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,239
we have fellowship one with another.

229
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,080
In the blood of Jesus Christ,

230
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,239
His Son cleanseth us from all sin.

231
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:58,039
If we say that we have no sin,

232
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,000
we deceive ourselves and the truth

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,119
is not in us.

234
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,260
If we confess our sins,

235
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,500
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

236
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,699
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

237
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,279
If we say that we have not sinned,

238
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,760
we make Him a liar,

239
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,500
and His Word is not in us.

240
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,860
You think about the reference

241
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,200
in this portion of Scripture

242
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,899
about fellowship with God,

243
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,379
and we understand as we've often used

244
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,340
the illustration or the analogy

245
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,280
over the years of the difference, if you will,

246
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,020
between relationship and fellowship.

247
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,220
I'm thankful that as many as received Him,

248
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,939
to them gave He power to become the sons of God,

249
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,419
and He is my Father, I am His Son,

250
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,259
and what a joy that is.

251
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,860
In fact, we're reminded of that

252
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,240
in this same passage of Scripture.

253
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,560
Say, our Father, that relationship.

254
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
But there is fellowship.

255
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,959
And just in life, as we can have a relationship

256
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,360
with an individual,

257
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,159
there's also the context of fellowship,

258
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,139
and we find that our fellowship with God

259
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,019
can be hindered because of sin.

260
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,019
We find that it's there in Psalm 66

261
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,419
and verse 18 when the psalmist says,

262
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,319
if I regard iniquity in my heart,

263
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,019
the Lord will not hear me.

264
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,360
And you think about that hindered fellowship.

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
And I believe it was D.L. Moody

266
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,839
that said sin will keep you from this book

267
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
or this book will keep you from sin.

268
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
What's he meaning by that?

269
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,360
Well, if you're living a life of sin

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
and you're not dealing with your sin,

271
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,680
you're not aware of your sin,

272
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,839
you're not confessing your sin

273
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,180
and you're living in sin,

274
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,879
you probably don't have much of a desire

275
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,559
to read the Word of God.

276
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,000
Because the Word of God's gonna convict you

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,839
about that sin.

278
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,239
The Holy Spirit of God's gonna use

279
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,160
the Word of God to convict you.

280
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,639
And so if you're living in that sin,

281
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,959
you don't want to be reading the Bible.

282
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,279
But if you're reading the Word of God

283
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,040
and you're in it and you're in the Bible

284
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,440
and allowing it to be in you,

285
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,319
it'll help us to sin less.

286
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,879
Someone said this,

287
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,720
that we'll never reach a place of sinlessness

288
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,400
before we reach the shores of heaven.

289
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
But the reality is that as we walk with God,

290
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,239
we should be sinning less.

291
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,039
And certainly I believe there is great truth

292
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,440
in that statement.

293
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm mindful of what the Old Testament,

294
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,960
two thoughts this evening,

295
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,919
one from the life of Joseph,

296
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,759
turn over if you will to the book of Genesis

297
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,279
in chapter 39.

298
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,600
And just this thought of the awareness of sin

299
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,679
when we say forgive us our sins,

300
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,919
we're being aware of the fact

301
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,279
that we're sinful people.

302
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,679
This upcoming Sunday morning,

303
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,119
I'm gonna preach a message

304
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,800
from the book of 1 Timothy.

305
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,119
And the passage of scripture

306
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,119
that I'll be dealing with

307
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,679
is that Christ Jesus came into the world

308
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,479
to save sinners.

309
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, the reality is that we're living,

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,199
I'm gonna give you a little preview

311
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,440
for Sunday's message,

312
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
but we're living in a time in which

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,800
people almost don't want to refer to somebody

314
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,639
as being a sinner

315
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,839
because they don't want to be offensive.

316
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, if we weren't sinners,

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,119
then Christ Jesus didn't have to come save us, amen?

318
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,880
But we're sinners in need of a savior,

319
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,119
the savior, the only savior.

320
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,600
And so we find here that this awareness

321
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,759
of our sinfulness,

322
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,039
it's important for us to understand

323
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,080
so that we would not live this life

324
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,399
with hindered fellowship,

325
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,160
but that we would have proper fellowship with God.

326
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,839
Notice in Genesis 39,

327
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
we're jumping into the portion of scripture

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
just to see the perspective and attitude of Joseph.

329
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,119
Of course, contextually what's happening

330
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:30,720
is the wife of Potiphar has come

331
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,039
and said, lie with me, and he refused.

332
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,000
Look in verse number nine.

333
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,039
It says this,

334
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,160
there's none greater in this house than I,

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee.

336
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,960
This is Joseph speaking to the wife of Potiphar.

337
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,199
He says, because thou art his wife.

338
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,199
Notice what he says.

339
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
Notice the perspective of Joseph.

340
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,240
How then can I do this great wickedness

341
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,919
and sin against God?

342
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,279
You know, when we don't really

343
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,759
want to talk about sin

344
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,199
because it's just not the politically correct thing

345
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,039
to talk about,

346
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,600
it's not really well received,

347
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,160
you shouldn't tell anyone they're a sinner.

348
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,919
You know, you're going to mess with their self-esteem

349
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,720
and so on and so forth.

350
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,440
The reality is that what we do

351
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
is we begin to lose the sinfulness of sin,

352
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,679
the wickedness of sin.

353
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,679
It's what sent our Savior to the cross

354
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,760
was the sin of mankind.

355
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,600
And we find here that Joseph's perspective is this,

356
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,880
how then can I do this great wickedness

357
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,720
and sin against God?

358
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,160
The thrice holy God.

359
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,600
Joseph, living in the presence of God,

360
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,640
no doubt, though he's in the land of Egypt,

361
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,440
he's living in the very presence of God.

362
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,359
And he says, how can I do this great wickedness?

363
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,679
See, this model prayer, this framework,

364
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,399
when we say forgive us our sins,

365
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,880
again, not just a broad paintbrush of

366
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,279
if I sin, would you forgive me?

367
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,880
But that we recognize and identify sin in our life

368
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,519
that we ask, allow the Holy Spirit of God

369
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,200
to search us and show us

370
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,880
that there be any wicked way.

371
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,359
We find that it was David in Psalm 51.

372
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,160
We won't take the time this evening

373
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,320
to read really any of that portion of Scripture,

374
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
but it is of interest to note

375
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,679
that in part of that prayer, he says,

376
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,559
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

377
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,959
What was it that stole the joy from David?

378
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,320
It was sin.

379
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,239
It was sin.

380
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,640
And so David, in his prayer of confession

381
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
against thee and thee only,

382
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,640
have I sinned and done this wickedness?

383
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,279
And you read his confession in Psalm 51

384
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,000
and what a powerful passage of Scripture it is.

385
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,519
But we find that he prays

386
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,359
within the context of that prayer,

387
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,480
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

388
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,200
See, this evening as we look at this model

389
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,920
that the Lord Jesus Christ gives to the disciples

390
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,399
and by way of preservation,

391
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,679
He's still here with us this evening,

392
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,959
that He says, and forgive us our sins,

393
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,920
that there would be this awareness

394
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
of our sinfulness.

395
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Not only an awareness of our sinfulness,

396
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
but also it reminds us and causes us

397
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,600
to be aware of God's forgiveness.

398
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,119
And forgive us our sins.

399
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,760
Aren't you thankful this evening

400
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,200
to know that our God is a forgiving God?

401
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,399
I mean, it would be a terrible thing

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,160
for us to just look at the Word of God

403
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,480
and understand that we're sinners

404
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,119
and that's the end of the story.

405
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:48,040
Oftentimes, as I share the Gospel with individuals,

406
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,959
I'll stop midstream of Romans 6

407
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,480
and verse 23,

408
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,600
because I want to deal with the first portion

409
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,839
of that Scripture.

410
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,880
The wages of sin is death.

411
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,480
And I'll make sure I adequately explain to them

412
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,720
what a wage is and so on and so forth.

413
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,559
And I'll go through that and I'll say,

414
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,920
now that's really bad news,

415
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,320
but the reality is that the story doesn't end there.

416
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
There's a conjunction,

417
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,399
but the gift of God is eternal life

418
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,600
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

419
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,799
And we understand that's dealing with salvation.

420
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,920
And here as we look at this passage of Scripture

421
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,119
dealing with the sin and the life of a believer,

422
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,320
but I'm so thankful that there's forgiveness

423
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,279
with our God.

424
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,720
When you notice the verbiage

425
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
when Jesus is giving this response

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,239
to the disciples and He says,

427
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,559
forgive us our sins,

428
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,359
we're mindful not only of the fact

429
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,040
that we're sinners,

430
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,279
but we're mindful of the fact

431
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,839
that our God is forgiving.

432
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,040
What a joy to know the forgiveness of God.

433
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
You know, this evening,

434
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,640
there are some that do not know

435
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,160
what it really means to be forgiven.

436
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,519
They can't fully identify with you

437
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,679
and with me with regard to the statement

438
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,480
of saying, I'm forgiven.

439
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,399
They've not experienced that.

440
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,640
In fact, I've spoken to some over the years

441
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,839
and I've said to them something

442
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,119
in this thought of,

443
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,839
you know, the problem is not

444
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,000
that God won't forgive you,

445
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
but you just won't forgive yourself.

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,079
They just don't know forgiveness.

447
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,920
I want you to think about some precious truth.

448
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,799
Go back if you were to the book of Psalm,

449
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,920
actually go back to the book of Nehemiah first.

450
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,000
Go to Nehemiah chapter number nine, if you will.

451
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,760
And I want you to look here

452
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,559
at what is said to us in this portion of Scripture.

453
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,719
It's interesting, in Nehemiah chapter number nine,

454
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,039
here in the beginning,

455
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,640
I wish we could just have time

456
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,359
to read the entirety of the chapter,

457
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,280
but you find that it's here at the beginning.

458
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,400
Notice what happens in verse number two.

459
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,239
It says,

460
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,799
and the seed of Israel separated themselves

461
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,640
from all the strangers,

462
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,479
notice this,

463
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:01,000
and stood and confessed their sins

464
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,799
and the iniquities of their fathers.

465
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,719
And they stood according to verse number three

466
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,559
in their place and read of the book of the law,

467
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,400
the Lord, their God,

468
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
one fourth part of the day.

469
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
And another fourth part,

470
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,679
they confessed and worshiped the Lord, their God.

471
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,400
Now, really there's a nice pattern there.

472
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,719
As you read the word of God,

473
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,400
it reveals to you where you have sin, right?

474
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
They read it for a quarter of the day.

475
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,239
And then it was like, all right,

476
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,400
we now need to deal with what we've read

477
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,520
because there's a lot of things there

478
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
that have exposed the sin,

479
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,039
the iniquity in our lives.

480
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,640
And now we need to confess it.

481
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,159
Oftentimes, as I read the word of God,

482
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,599
in fact, every morning when I pray,

483
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,960
I pray specific things

484
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
with regard to my time

485
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,520
in which I'll spend in the word of God.

486
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,479
And one thing that I pray in particular

487
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,960
is God, would you show me

488
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,280
if there's anything that I'm doing

489
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
that I need to not do.

490
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,320
If there's something that I'm not doing

491
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,239
that I need to do.

492
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,719
The Holy Spirit of God uses the word.

493
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,280
So we find that they're confessing.

494
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,159
Notice in verse number 16,

495
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:07,199
Really, some overview history, if you will, of the nation is being just dealt with in

496
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,199
this center section.

497
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:12,359
It says in verse 16, but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and

498
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,719
hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey.

499
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:21,159
Neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their necks

500
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,699
and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage.

501
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:34,579
But notice this part at the end of verse 17, but thou art a God, ready to pardon, gracious

502
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:41,859
and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not.

503
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:45,219
Aren't you thankful that our God is ready to pardon?

504
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:50,859
Have you ever had a situation where maybe there was an offense between you and someone,

505
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:56,179
an earthly relationship, and there's an offense, and you want somebody to forgive you, and

506
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,419
maybe you're pleading with them to forgive you.

507
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,299
Maybe they don't have a forgiving spirit.

508
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,579
Maybe they're, I don't know, I've got to think about that.

509
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:07,259
You know, you really hurt me, I'll forgive you this time, but if you do it again kind

510
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,259
of stuff.

511
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:09,859
I mean, that happens sometimes.

512
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:14,339
You know, God is ready to pardon.

513
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,339
Think about that.

514
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,419
He says, forgive us our sins.

515
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:22,499
Why can we go to God and ask for forgiveness?

516
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,139
Because it's in His character and nature.

517
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,619
He's ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

518
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,259
He is a God who offers forgiveness.

519
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,619
And what a joy that is.

520
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:36,739
There's an awareness here, not only of our sinfulness, but of God's forgiveness.

521
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:42,139
Turn over, if you will, to the book of Psalms, Psalm 86 and verse number 5.

522
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:48,739
In Psalm 86, we find here that the psalmist is making great declaration, again, with regard

523
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:52,339
to the grace and mercy of God.

524
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:58,059
And we find that it's said in Nehemiah 9.17 that God is a God who is ready to pardon.

525
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:04,559
Here in Psalm 86 and verse number 5, the Bible says, for thou, Lord, art good and ready to

526
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,399
forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.

527
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:15,119
Aren't you thankful for that?

528
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,919
In Psalm 130 and verse number 4, the psalmist says that we should rejoice.

529
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,919
Why?

530
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,499
In Psalm 130 and verse number 4, but there is forgiveness with Thee.

531
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:31,119
Our God is a God who forgives.

532
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,919
Forgive us our sins.

533
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,879
That awareness that, yes, we have sinned, but the awareness that our God is gracious

534
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:42,679
and merciful, I touched on this verse of Scripture on Sunday morning, but go with me and finish

535
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:49,999
up in Proverbs chapter 28, if you will, in Proverbs chapter 28, and we find that this

536
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:58,439
truth with regard to forgive us our sins and the awareness of our sin, the forgiveness

537
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:05,279
that God offers in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13, the Bible says, he that covereth

538
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,879
his sins shall not prosper.

539
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:12,999
The reality this evening is that most of us, I don't think I have to belabor the point

540
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:16,239
to convince you that you still sin.

541
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:20,159
You know what I mean?

542
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,839
I talked to a couple of fellows on Sunday, I mentioned on Sunday night, and I said, hey,

543
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,479
the Bible says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

544
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,479
Have you sinned?

545
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,479
Ah, probably.

546
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:36,679
And I said, what kind of answer is probably, either yes or no?

547
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,399
And I said, well, do you know the Ten Commandments?

548
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,399
No.

549
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,399
And I just shared one of them, thou shalt not bear false witness.

550
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,079
That means you shouldn't lie.

551
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,079
So have you ever lied?

552
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,079
Well, probably.

553
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:51,159
And I was a little bit frustrated at that point, and I said, listen, you've lied.

554
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:53,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've lied.

555
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,359
Okay, then you're a sinner.

556
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,719
But for the crowd that's here this evening, and probably for those that are tuned in via

557
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:04,039
live stream, I don't have to convince you that you sin.

558
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:09,539
Here it says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

559
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:14,559
The model, the framework that Jesus gives in response to the request, teach us to pray,

560
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,719
one of the points, the one that we're focused on this evening, forgive us our sins.

561
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:24,959
It makes no sense for us to cover and hide our sin.

562
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:29,679
Let me ask you, does God know everything?

563
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,079
He's omniscient, right?

564
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,079
He knows all things.

565
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,519
So does He know when you sin?

566
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,519
Does He know your thoughts?

567
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,959
Does He know your motives?

568
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,839
Sometimes we can have impure motives, right?

569
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,199
Sometimes we can have wrong thoughts.

570
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:48,439
And the reality is that somebody else might not even know what you're thinking.

571
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:54,119
How many times did Jesus confront those during His earthly ministry and confront them on

572
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,359
what they were thinking, though they did not verbalize anything?

573
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:03,999
We mentioned on Sunday evening in Genesis chapter number 18, when the Lord says to Abraham,

574
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,539
why did Sarah laugh?

575
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,599
She laughed within herself.

576
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,759
It was almost as if it was news to Abraham that Sarah laughed.

577
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,559
He didn't even hear it, but God knew it.

578
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,159
She tried to deny it, and God said, no, you did.

579
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,239
See, God knows that we sin.

580
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,239
He knows our thoughts.

581
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,239
He knows our motives.

582
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,799
He knows our actions.

583
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,199
There's nothing that is hid from Him.

584
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:36,159
It says, "...he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh

585
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,859
them shall have mercy."

586
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:46,899
If we know that God knows all things, and we know that He knows that we sin, and at

587
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:53,099
the same time we know that our God is ready to pardon and ready to forgive, and He says,

588
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,699
if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us

589
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:03,219
from all unrighteousness, wouldn't it just make sense that we would confess and forsake

590
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:09,459
our sins so that we could have mercy, forgiveness, have that restored fellowship, have our joy

591
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:15,699
returned to us, that joy that David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation?

592
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:22,859
See, this evening as we continue to make our way slowly through this response of Jesus

593
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:29,859
in Luke chapter 11, we come to a very important part of this framework, the part of our prayer

594
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:37,579
in which some have used the acts, ACTS, for number one, adoration, and then C, confession,

595
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,739
and then thanksgiving, and then supplication.

596
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:52,379
And this would focus upon that second tier, if you will, of confession.

597
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,139
Forgive us our sins.

598
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:59,379
I'm thankful this evening that I don't need to go to some man to find forgiveness for

599
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,379
our sins, amen?

600
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:07,859
There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

601
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:15,019
But can I tell you this evening that in the life of a believer, we still sin, and we still

602
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:18,379
need to seek the face of God.

603
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,699
Forgive us our sins.

604
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:29,699
If we take the skeletal outline, if you will, of Luke 11, and we use it as framework, as

605
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:37,459
a model, and we truly deal with that confession aspect, forgive us our sins, we're more mindful

606
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,899
and aware of our own sinfulness.

607
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:44,579
We're mindful and aware of Christ's forgiveness.

608
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,259
And I'm so thankful this evening that we have a God who's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

609
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:56,939
The problem is sometimes we don't really deal with the confession part.

610
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,539
I'm forgiven.

611
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:00,779
It's under the blood.

612
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,339
I'm thankful that it is, and I'm thankful that I'm saved and I'm delivered from the

613
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:12,339
penalty, the power of sin, but I don't want my fellowship with God to be hindered.

614
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:17,659
I want to have, I want to walk in the light as He is in the light, amen?

615
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,779
So this evening, forgive us our sins, a prayer of repentance.

616
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,899
Father, we love you, and we thank you for loving us.

617
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:29,659
We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to once again open your Word for

618
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:35,659
a few moments and study this portion of Scripture as we're slowly, methodically making our way

619
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,299
through this.

620
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,659
Lord, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

621
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:46,019
I pray that you would help us, Lord, to see a revival of prayer in our lives, in our families,

622
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,819
in our church.

623
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,379
Lord, thank you for the privilege of entering into your presence.

624
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:57,299
Thank you, God.

625
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,500
You hear and answer prayer.

626
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,979
It's not just some religious activity.

627
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:10,979
We're literally in your presence and communing with you, the God of the universe, our Father.

628
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,019
What a joy and privilege.

629
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:15,219
I pray that you'd bless our time.

630
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,619
You'd be exalted and magnified, and we'll thank you for it.

631
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,099
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

632
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,859
Do we have any left or no?

633
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:22,859
We've got a few left this evening.

634
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:23,940
Does anyone need one?
