WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
is in verse number four this evening.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.559
And of course, you know that on Wednesday evenings

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.639
for a number of weeks now, we have taken our time

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.279
going through these first few verses of Luke chapter number

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.279
11 and dealing with this request from the disciple

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.239
when he said, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.079
The very beginning lesson from this portion of Scripture,

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.399
I made the statement that of all the things

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.879
the disciple could have asked the Lord to teach them

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:33.279
or him, he said, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:36.520
And I've made mention throughout this mini series

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.900
from this portion of Scripture, how we need a revival,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.400
a prayer revival in our lives, individually in our homes,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.200
our families, our churches, we need a revival of prayer.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.599
I'm thankful to report that God still hears

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:54.159
and answers prayer and that he is able to do

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.400
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.479
And what a great privilege, a unique privilege

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.800
for the child of God to enter into the very throne room

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.919
of heaven into the presence of God

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.080
and worship him through prayer.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.339
And of course, make our petitions known.

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:12.959
Of course, as we've studied through this,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.720
we've understood that the disciple made the request

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.319
and the response of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.239
begins to teach all of the disciples.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.839
He said unto them, when ye pray.

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:25.480
In other words, it was an assumed practice,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.599
an expectation that the people of God

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.160
would be people of prayer.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.440
He didn't say if you pray, he said when you pray.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.160
And we understand that it's certainly a privilege of ours

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.919
as he then says, say our Father.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:40.739
We think about the relationship that we have

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:43.239
with the God of heaven is because of that relationship

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:46.819
that we have access, the very throne room of God.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.239
And this evening, we understand that he is

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.440
the Lord God omnipotent, that he rules and reigns,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.199
that he's the creator and sustainer of all things.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.800
And yet, we have a relationship with him.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.040
And what a great reminder, even as we enter

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.440
into our time of prayer, we think that we'd understand

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.960
as we go through verse number two

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.160
that there would be an attitude of reverence.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.800
Hallowed be thy name.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.320
The holiness of God is in full view

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.919
and understanding who he is

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.119
and understanding that we enter in with this spirit,

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.320
this attitude of reverence.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.960
And then, the attitude of submission.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.399
We dealt with not only having an attitude of reverence,

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:32.800
but an attitude of submission.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.080
When he said, thy kingdom come,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160
thy will be done as in heaven, so in earth.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.880
Last Wednesday evening, we looked at verse number three

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880
and we dealt with the fact that our God is the provider.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.360
We understand that in Genesis chapter number 22,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.160
God will make himself known to Abraham

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.880
as Jehovah Jireh, the God who provides,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.440
the Lord who provides.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.880
And I'm so thankful that as our shepherd,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.520
he's a good shepherd and he provides for us.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520
And we looked at that in verse number three.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.800
This evening, as we look at verse number four,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.119
if you're taking notes,

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.880
I just simply want to title the message tonight,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.039
Prayer of Repentance.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.240
Prayer of Repentance.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.479
Notice with me that the Bible says,

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.520
and forgive us our sins.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.080
And forgive us our sins.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.600
Again, as I've made known throughout this mini series,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.199
this is not a prayer that is to be just memorized

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.820
and mindlessly repeated throughout the day,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.360
perhaps multiple times a day.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.919
That's not the idea.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.199
Really, Jesus is giving us a model or framework for prayer.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.000
This prayer that is mentioned here,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.500
this model or framework of prayer,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.360
you find that though the New Testament

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.759
will record a number of God's people praying,

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.080
never will you find this repeated verbatim.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.759
And so we find that it is not just this idea

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.360
when we see this forgive us our sins,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.759
that it's just, Lord, if I sin, forgive me.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.320
It's really not the idea.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.199
Again, framework for prayer.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.679
As I think about this phrase in verse number four

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.720
that begins, and forgive us our sins,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.359
this prayer of repentance,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.880
I really see two things that it makes us aware of.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.559
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.920
there's an awareness of our sinfulness.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.079
An awareness of our sinfulness.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:29.359
The reality is that I am thankful this evening to be saved.

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:30.760
Amen?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.320
What a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.559
as your personal Savior.

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.640
What a joy to know that you're forgiven.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.160
We'll sing songs about being forgiven.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.239
I'm redeemed.

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:42.119
I'm forgiven forever.

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.200
And we think about that wonderful truth.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.359
And with salvation certainly comes

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.359
a deliverance from the penalty of sin

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:52.480
and a deliverance from the power of sin.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.040
Sin no longer has dominion over us.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.920
And I'm thankful for that.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.559
But the reality is that each of us

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.359
that are still here have the flesh.

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:04.079
And we still sin.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.799
And we sin daily.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:11.119
The reality is that we are in this body, in this flesh.

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:12.600
We know that the Bible tells us

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.839
that the spirit and the flesh

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.279
that are at enmity one with the other.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.239
And we're to walk in the spirit

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:21.279
so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.720
according to Galatians chapter number five.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.320
But as we think about this phrase

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.720
in verse number four of Luke 11,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.640
we find that it just reminds us,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.519
it gives us this awareness of our sinfulness.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.160
And yet one day, thankfully,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.359
as we look at the whole of the scriptures,

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:40.040
we will be in heaven.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.359
We'll be separated.

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:42.760
We'll have a glorified body.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.000
No more sin.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.799
And what a wonderful day that will be.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.440
But until then, we still struggle with this area of sin.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.640
There is a common teaching that is out there.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.000
It's not really anything new.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.079
It's certainly in recent years, I would say,

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.559
has gained a lot of traction

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.480
within a certain contingency of people.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.600
And it's a teaching known as antinomianism.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.720
And really this idea in which we're under grace,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.760
and so therefore there's really no need

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.519
for us to even think about sin

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.079
or confess sin because we've been forgiven.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:20.519
And so therefore, we're not under the law,

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.559
we're under grace,

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:23.720
and so we don't even have to think about it

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.320
because we're forgiven.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.720
In fact, one of the leaders of that particular idea

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.200
from yesteryear made the statement

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.519
that God would forgive us

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:37.079
because that's his duty, his responsibility.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.399
When you look at the framework here of this model prayer,

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.920
and Jesus says, say, our Father which art in heaven,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.320
we've studied all those phrases,

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:48.000
and forgive us our sins.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.760
There's this awareness of our sinfulness.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.880
The reality is that we would find

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.720
that as we look at the Old Testament,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.880
and I'm so thankful not to live

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.720
under the Old Testament era,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.040
but in the Old Testament,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.079
there was a regular reminder of sin.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:05.920
What was that?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.519
Well, there was an offering,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:11.399
a sacrifice that was made regularly.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.079
And depending on those sins of omission,

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:15.239
sins of commission,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.839
there are all sorts of things.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.119
We often think about the Ten Commandments,

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:21.679
but the law in its broader sense

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:24.959
had many more points than just the Ten Commandments.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.880
And you would find in the Old Testament,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880
if you'd study through,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.920
and you'd look at all of those truths that are related,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.160
is that there would be certain offerings

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.760
that would be required based on certain sins

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.160
that would be committed.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.040
And so there was a regular reminder.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.640
You think about the truth

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:45.559
of the Old Testament priest

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.640
and the way in which they daily ministered

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.200
and all of these offerings and sacrifices.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200
You go to the tabernacle and you find

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.399
the brazen altar, the first piece of furniture

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.279
that you would come to,

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.239
and the offering being required.

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:00.320
And we find that there would be that daily reminder

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.480
for the people of God of their sinfulness

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.119
and that sin costs something.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.920
In the New Testament,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.480
I am so thankful that Jesus paid it all.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.679
That He said, it is finished.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.679
We often speak about that many religions

00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:21.160
of the world will say do,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.279
but the biblical Christianity says done.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.480
For Jesus paid it all.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.160
He said, it is finished.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.159
And I'm so thankful for that truth.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.799
When we think about the reality

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.320
as New Testament believers,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.960
if we're not careful,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.640
we can get into a pattern

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.200
in which we're not mindful,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.760
aware of our sinfulness

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.880
and the way that it can hinder

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.679
our fellowship with God.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.440
See, sin in the life of a believer

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.760
is something in which needs to be confessed

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.039
as we find here and forgive us our sins.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:56.960
Why?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.080
Well, we understand that sin hinders our fellowship.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.239
In fact, if you look at 1 John 1,

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:04.640
if you hold your place there in Luke

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.760
and turn over there,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.719
and 1 John 1,

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:10.640
I want you to notice,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.400
beginning in verse number five

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.440
of this portion of Scripture,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080
we find that John says in 1 John 1,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.239
beginning in verse number five,

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:20.760
this then is the message

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.840
which we have heard of Him

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.080
and declare unto you that God is light

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.359
and in Him is no darkness at all.

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:35.679
If we say that we have fellowship with Him

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:38.479
and walk in darkness,

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:41.599
we lie and do not the truth.

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:44.440
But, if we walk in the light

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.960
as He is in the light,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.239
we have fellowship one with another.

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:51.080
In the blood of Jesus Christ,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.239
His Son cleanseth us from all sin.

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:58.039
If we say that we have no sin,

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.000
we deceive ourselves and the truth

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.119
is not in us.

00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:04.260
If we confess our sins,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.500
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.699
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:13.279
If we say that we have not sinned,

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.760
we make Him a liar,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.500
and His Word is not in us.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.860
You think about the reference

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.200
in this portion of Scripture

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.899
about fellowship with God,

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.379
and we understand as we've often used

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:26.340
the illustration or the analogy

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.280
over the years of the difference, if you will,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.020
between relationship and fellowship.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.220
I'm thankful that as many as received Him,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.939
to them gave He power to become the sons of God,

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:39.419
and He is my Father, I am His Son,

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:41.259
and what a joy that is.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:42.860
In fact, we're reminded of that

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.240
in this same passage of Scripture.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.560
Say, our Father, that relationship.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.040
But there is fellowship.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.959
And just in life, as we can have a relationship

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.360
with an individual,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.159
there's also the context of fellowship,

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:01.139
and we find that our fellowship with God

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:04.019
can be hindered because of sin.

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.019
We find that it's there in Psalm 66

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.419
and verse 18 when the psalmist says,

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:10.319
if I regard iniquity in my heart,

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:13.019
the Lord will not hear me.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:15.360
And you think about that hindered fellowship.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.040
And I believe it was D.L. Moody

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.839
that said sin will keep you from this book

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:23.360
or this book will keep you from sin.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.440
What's he meaning by that?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.360
Well, if you're living a life of sin

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.720
and you're not dealing with your sin,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.680
you're not aware of your sin,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.839
you're not confessing your sin

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:32.180
and you're living in sin,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.879
you probably don't have much of a desire

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.559
to read the Word of God.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:37.000
Because the Word of God's gonna convict you

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.839
about that sin.

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:39.239
The Holy Spirit of God's gonna use

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.160
the Word of God to convict you.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.639
And so if you're living in that sin,

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.959
you don't want to be reading the Bible.

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.279
But if you're reading the Word of God

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.040
and you're in it and you're in the Bible

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.440
and allowing it to be in you,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.319
it'll help us to sin less.

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:54.879
Someone said this,

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:57.720
that we'll never reach a place of sinlessness

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.400
before we reach the shores of heaven.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.800
But the reality is that as we walk with God,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.239
we should be sinning less.

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:08.039
And certainly I believe there is great truth

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.440
in that statement.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.440
I'm mindful of what the Old Testament,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.960
two thoughts this evening,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.919
one from the life of Joseph,

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.759
turn over if you will to the book of Genesis

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.279
in chapter 39.

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.600
And just this thought of the awareness of sin

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.679
when we say forgive us our sins,

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:26.919
we're being aware of the fact

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:29.279
that we're sinful people.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.679
This upcoming Sunday morning,

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.119
I'm gonna preach a message

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.800
from the book of 1 Timothy.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.119
And the passage of scripture

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:38.119
that I'll be dealing with

00:12:38.119 --> 00:12:40.679
is that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:43.479
to save sinners.

00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:45.000
You know, the reality is that we're living,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.199
I'm gonna give you a little preview

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.440
for Sunday's message,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.360
but we're living in a time in which

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.800
people almost don't want to refer to somebody

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.639
as being a sinner

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.839
because they don't want to be offensive.

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:56.000
Well, if we weren't sinners,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.119
then Christ Jesus didn't have to come save us, amen?

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:01.880
But we're sinners in need of a savior,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.119
the savior, the only savior.

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:06.600
And so we find here that this awareness

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.759
of our sinfulness,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:10.039
it's important for us to understand

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.080
so that we would not live this life

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.399
with hindered fellowship,

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.160
but that we would have proper fellowship with God.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.839
Notice in Genesis 39,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.320
we're jumping into the portion of scripture

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.399
just to see the perspective and attitude of Joseph.

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:27.119
Of course, contextually what's happening

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:30.720
is the wife of Potiphar has come

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.039
and said, lie with me, and he refused.

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:35.000
Look in verse number nine.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.039
It says this,

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:38.160
there's none greater in this house than I,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.160
neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.960
This is Joseph speaking to the wife of Potiphar.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.199
He says, because thou art his wife.

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:47.199
Notice what he says.

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:49.839
Notice the perspective of Joseph.

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:54.240
How then can I do this great wickedness

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.919
and sin against God?

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:00.279
You know, when we don't really

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.759
want to talk about sin

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:05.199
because it's just not the politically correct thing

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.039
to talk about,

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.600
it's not really well received,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.160
you shouldn't tell anyone they're a sinner.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.919
You know, you're going to mess with their self-esteem

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.720
and so on and so forth.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.440
The reality is that what we do

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.720
is we begin to lose the sinfulness of sin,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.679
the wickedness of sin.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.679
It's what sent our Savior to the cross

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:26.760
was the sin of mankind.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.600
And we find here that Joseph's perspective is this,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.880
how then can I do this great wickedness

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.720
and sin against God?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.160
The thrice holy God.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.600
Joseph, living in the presence of God,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.640
no doubt, though he's in the land of Egypt,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.440
he's living in the very presence of God.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.359
And he says, how can I do this great wickedness?

00:14:56.359 --> 00:14:58.679
See, this model prayer, this framework,

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.399
when we say forgive us our sins,

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:03.880
again, not just a broad paintbrush of

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.279
if I sin, would you forgive me?

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:09.880
But that we recognize and identify sin in our life

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.519
that we ask, allow the Holy Spirit of God

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.200
to search us and show us

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.880
that there be any wicked way.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.359
We find that it was David in Psalm 51.

00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:25.160
We won't take the time this evening

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.320
to read really any of that portion of Scripture,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.320
but it is of interest to note

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.679
that in part of that prayer, he says,

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:37.559
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:40.959
What was it that stole the joy from David?

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.320
It was sin.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.239
It was sin.

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:46.640
And so David, in his prayer of confession

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.600
against thee and thee only,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.640
have I sinned and done this wickedness?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.279
And you read his confession in Psalm 51

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:57.000
and what a powerful passage of Scripture it is.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.519
But we find that he prays

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:00.359
within the context of that prayer,

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:04.480
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.200
See, this evening as we look at this model

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.920
that the Lord Jesus Christ gives to the disciples

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.399
and by way of preservation,

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:13.679
He's still here with us this evening,

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.959
that He says, and forgive us our sins,

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:17.920
that there would be this awareness

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.440
of our sinfulness.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.440
Not only an awareness of our sinfulness,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.519
but also it reminds us and causes us

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:27.600
to be aware of God's forgiveness.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.119
And forgive us our sins.

00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:32.760
Aren't you thankful this evening

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.200
to know that our God is a forgiving God?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.399
I mean, it would be a terrible thing

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.160
for us to just look at the Word of God

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.480
and understand that we're sinners

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.119
and that's the end of the story.

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:48.040
Oftentimes, as I share the Gospel with individuals,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.959
I'll stop midstream of Romans 6

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:52.480
and verse 23,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.600
because I want to deal with the first portion

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.839
of that Scripture.

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:59.880
The wages of sin is death.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.480
And I'll make sure I adequately explain to them

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.720
what a wage is and so on and so forth.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.559
And I'll go through that and I'll say,

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.920
now that's really bad news,

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:12.320
but the reality is that the story doesn't end there.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.440
There's a conjunction,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.399
but the gift of God is eternal life

00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:18.600
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.799
And we understand that's dealing with salvation.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.920
And here as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.119
dealing with the sin and the life of a believer,

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.320
but I'm so thankful that there's forgiveness

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.279
with our God.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:30.720
When you notice the verbiage

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.440
when Jesus is giving this response

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.239
to the disciples and He says,

00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:37.559
forgive us our sins,

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.359
we're mindful not only of the fact

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.040
that we're sinners,

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.279
but we're mindful of the fact

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:46.839
that our God is forgiving.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:50.040
What a joy to know the forgiveness of God.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040
You know, this evening,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.640
there are some that do not know

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.160
what it really means to be forgiven.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.519
They can't fully identify with you

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:03.679
and with me with regard to the statement

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:06.480
of saying, I'm forgiven.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.399
They've not experienced that.

00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:11.640
In fact, I've spoken to some over the years

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.839
and I've said to them something

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:16.119
in this thought of,

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:17.839
you know, the problem is not

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.000
that God won't forgive you,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
but you just won't forgive yourself.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.079
They just don't know forgiveness.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:26.920
I want you to think about some precious truth.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.799
Go back if you were to the book of Psalm,

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.920
actually go back to the book of Nehemiah first.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.000
Go to Nehemiah chapter number nine, if you will.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.760
And I want you to look here

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:39.559
at what is said to us in this portion of Scripture.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.719
It's interesting, in Nehemiah chapter number nine,

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:46.039
here in the beginning,

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.640
I wish we could just have time

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.359
to read the entirety of the chapter,

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:52.280
but you find that it's here at the beginning.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.400
Notice what happens in verse number two.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.239
It says,

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.799
and the seed of Israel separated themselves

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:57.640
from all the strangers,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.479
notice this,

00:18:58.479 --> 00:19:01.000
and stood and confessed their sins

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.799
and the iniquities of their fathers.

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:06.719
And they stood according to verse number three

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:08.559
in their place and read of the book of the law,

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.400
the Lord, their God,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.760
one fourth part of the day.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.080
And another fourth part,

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.679
they confessed and worshiped the Lord, their God.

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:17.400
Now, really there's a nice pattern there.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.719
As you read the word of God,

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:21.400
it reveals to you where you have sin, right?

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.200
They read it for a quarter of the day.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.239
And then it was like, all right,

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:26.400
we now need to deal with what we've read

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.520
because there's a lot of things there

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.520
that have exposed the sin,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.039
the iniquity in our lives.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.640
And now we need to confess it.

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:37.159
Oftentimes, as I read the word of God,

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:39.599
in fact, every morning when I pray,

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:40.960
I pray specific things

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.960
with regard to my time

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.520
in which I'll spend in the word of God.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.479
And one thing that I pray in particular

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:47.960
is God, would you show me

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.280
if there's anything that I'm doing

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.440
that I need to not do.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.320
If there's something that I'm not doing

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.239
that I need to do.

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:56.719
The Holy Spirit of God uses the word.

00:19:56.719 --> 00:19:58.280
So we find that they're confessing.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.159
Notice in verse number 16,

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:07.199
Really, some overview history, if you will, of the nation is being just dealt with in

00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:08.199
this center section.

00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:12.359
It says in verse 16, but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:16.719
hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey.

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:21.159
Neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their necks

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:24.699
and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage.

00:20:24.699 --> 00:20:34.579
But notice this part at the end of verse 17, but thou art a God, ready to pardon, gracious

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:41.859
and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not.

00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:45.219
Aren't you thankful that our God is ready to pardon?

00:20:45.219 --> 00:20:50.859
Have you ever had a situation where maybe there was an offense between you and someone,

00:20:50.859 --> 00:20:56.179
an earthly relationship, and there's an offense, and you want somebody to forgive you, and

00:20:56.179 --> 00:20:59.419
maybe you're pleading with them to forgive you.

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:01.299
Maybe they don't have a forgiving spirit.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:03.579
Maybe they're, I don't know, I've got to think about that.

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:07.259
You know, you really hurt me, I'll forgive you this time, but if you do it again kind

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:08.259
of stuff.

00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:09.859
I mean, that happens sometimes.

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:14.339
You know, God is ready to pardon.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.339
Think about that.

00:21:15.339 --> 00:21:17.419
He says, forgive us our sins.

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:22.499
Why can we go to God and ask for forgiveness?

00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:24.139
Because it's in His character and nature.

00:21:24.139 --> 00:21:26.619
He's ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:30.259
He is a God who offers forgiveness.

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:31.619
And what a joy that is.

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:36.739
There's an awareness here, not only of our sinfulness, but of God's forgiveness.

00:21:36.739 --> 00:21:42.139
Turn over, if you will, to the book of Psalms, Psalm 86 and verse number 5.

00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:48.739
In Psalm 86, we find here that the psalmist is making great declaration, again, with regard

00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:52.339
to the grace and mercy of God.

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:58.059
And we find that it's said in Nehemiah 9.17 that God is a God who is ready to pardon.

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:04.559
Here in Psalm 86 and verse number 5, the Bible says, for thou, Lord, art good and ready to

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:11.399
forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.

00:22:11.399 --> 00:22:15.119
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:19.919
In Psalm 130 and verse number 4, the psalmist says that we should rejoice.

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:20.919
Why?

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:27.499
In Psalm 130 and verse number 4, but there is forgiveness with Thee.

00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:31.119
Our God is a God who forgives.

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:32.919
Forgive us our sins.

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:36.879
That awareness that, yes, we have sinned, but the awareness that our God is gracious

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:42.679
and merciful, I touched on this verse of Scripture on Sunday morning, but go with me and finish

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:49.999
up in Proverbs chapter 28, if you will, in Proverbs chapter 28, and we find that this

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:58.439
truth with regard to forgive us our sins and the awareness of our sin, the forgiveness

00:22:58.439 --> 00:23:05.279
that God offers in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13, the Bible says, he that covereth

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:08.879
his sins shall not prosper.

00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:12.999
The reality this evening is that most of us, I don't think I have to belabor the point

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:16.239
to convince you that you still sin.

00:23:16.239 --> 00:23:20.159
You know what I mean?

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:24.839
I talked to a couple of fellows on Sunday, I mentioned on Sunday night, and I said, hey,

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:27.479
the Bible says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:28.479
Have you sinned?

00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:29.479
Ah, probably.

00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:36.679
And I said, what kind of answer is probably, either yes or no?

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:38.399
And I said, well, do you know the Ten Commandments?

00:23:38.399 --> 00:23:39.399
No.

00:23:39.399 --> 00:23:41.399
And I just shared one of them, thou shalt not bear false witness.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:43.079
That means you shouldn't lie.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:44.079
So have you ever lied?

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:45.079
Well, probably.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:51.159
And I was a little bit frustrated at that point, and I said, listen, you've lied.

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:53.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've lied.

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:55.359
Okay, then you're a sinner.

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:58.719
But for the crowd that's here this evening, and probably for those that are tuned in via

00:23:58.719 --> 00:24:04.039
live stream, I don't have to convince you that you sin.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:09.539
Here it says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:14.559
The model, the framework that Jesus gives in response to the request, teach us to pray,

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:20.719
one of the points, the one that we're focused on this evening, forgive us our sins.

00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:24.959
It makes no sense for us to cover and hide our sin.

00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:29.679
Let me ask you, does God know everything?

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:31.079
He's omniscient, right?

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:32.079
He knows all things.

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:34.519
So does He know when you sin?

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:35.519
Does He know your thoughts?

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:38.959
Does He know your motives?

00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:41.839
Sometimes we can have impure motives, right?

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:44.199
Sometimes we can have wrong thoughts.

00:24:44.199 --> 00:24:48.439
And the reality is that somebody else might not even know what you're thinking.

00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:54.119
How many times did Jesus confront those during His earthly ministry and confront them on

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:58.359
what they were thinking, though they did not verbalize anything?

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:03.999
We mentioned on Sunday evening in Genesis chapter number 18, when the Lord says to Abraham,

00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:05.539
why did Sarah laugh?

00:25:05.539 --> 00:25:08.599
She laughed within herself.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:11.759
It was almost as if it was news to Abraham that Sarah laughed.

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:15.559
He didn't even hear it, but God knew it.

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:19.159
She tried to deny it, and God said, no, you did.

00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:22.239
See, God knows that we sin.

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:23.239
He knows our thoughts.

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:24.239
He knows our motives.

00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:25.799
He knows our actions.

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:29.199
There's nothing that is hid from Him.

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:36.159
It says, "...he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:40.859
them shall have mercy."

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:46.899
If we know that God knows all things, and we know that He knows that we sin, and at

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:53.099
the same time we know that our God is ready to pardon and ready to forgive, and He says,

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:58.699
if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us

00:25:58.699 --> 00:26:03.219
from all unrighteousness, wouldn't it just make sense that we would confess and forsake

00:26:03.219 --> 00:26:09.459
our sins so that we could have mercy, forgiveness, have that restored fellowship, have our joy

00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:15.699
returned to us, that joy that David said, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation?

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:22.859
See, this evening as we continue to make our way slowly through this response of Jesus

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:29.859
in Luke chapter 11, we come to a very important part of this framework, the part of our prayer

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:37.579
in which some have used the acts, ACTS, for number one, adoration, and then C, confession,

00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:46.739
and then thanksgiving, and then supplication.

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:52.379
And this would focus upon that second tier, if you will, of confession.

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:55.139
Forgive us our sins.

00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:59.379
I'm thankful this evening that I don't need to go to some man to find forgiveness for

00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:01.379
our sins, amen?

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:07.859
There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:15.019
But can I tell you this evening that in the life of a believer, we still sin, and we still

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:18.379
need to seek the face of God.

00:27:18.379 --> 00:27:22.699
Forgive us our sins.

00:27:22.699 --> 00:27:29.699
If we take the skeletal outline, if you will, of Luke 11, and we use it as framework, as

00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:37.459
a model, and we truly deal with that confession aspect, forgive us our sins, we're more mindful

00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:40.899
and aware of our own sinfulness.

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:44.579
We're mindful and aware of Christ's forgiveness.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:49.259
And I'm so thankful this evening that we have a God who's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:56.939
The problem is sometimes we don't really deal with the confession part.

00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:59.539
I'm forgiven.

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:00.779
It's under the blood.

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:05.339
I'm thankful that it is, and I'm thankful that I'm saved and I'm delivered from the

00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:12.339
penalty, the power of sin, but I don't want my fellowship with God to be hindered.

00:28:12.939 --> 00:28:17.659
I want to have, I want to walk in the light as He is in the light, amen?

00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:21.779
So this evening, forgive us our sins, a prayer of repentance.

00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:25.899
Father, we love you, and we thank you for loving us.

00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:29.659
We thank you for the privilege that you've given us to once again open your Word for

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:35.659
a few moments and study this portion of Scripture as we're slowly, methodically making our way

00:28:35.659 --> 00:28:37.299
through this.

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:40.659
Lord, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:28:40.659 --> 00:28:46.019
I pray that you would help us, Lord, to see a revival of prayer in our lives, in our families,

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:47.819
in our church.

00:28:47.819 --> 00:28:52.379
Lord, thank you for the privilege of entering into your presence.

00:28:52.379 --> 00:28:57.299
Thank you, God.

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:59.500
You hear and answer prayer.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.979
It's not just some religious activity.

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:10.979
We're literally in your presence and communing with you, the God of the universe, our Father.

00:29:10.979 --> 00:29:12.019
What a joy and privilege.

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:15.219
I pray that you'd bless our time.

00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:17.619
You'd be exalted and magnified, and we'll thank you for it.

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:19.099
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:21.859
Do we have any left or no?

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:22.859
We've got a few left this evening.

00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:23.940
Does anyone need one?
