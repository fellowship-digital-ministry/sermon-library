1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,199
day and night, forever and ever. Amen. And he is a defeated foe. He's a foe,

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:12,479
but he's a defeated foe. Amen. And what a wonderful song. So thankful for redemption

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:17,280
through the blood of Jesus Christ. Hebrews chapter number six this morning, Hebrews chapter number

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,000
six. And as you're turning there, I'm going to read, I'm going to read a passage of scripture

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,600
to you. And then I'm going to read you the words of a familiar hymn. Hebrews chapter number six.

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:38,159
We've been making our way through the book of Hebrews, of course, here in 2020. And we are

7
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,880
going to finish the sixth chapter this morning and we're making progress. This of course is the last

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,919
section of this warning that we're in the midst of. We've had several messages now at the end of

9
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:55,599
chapter number five, really beginning in verse number 11, all the way through the end of chapter

10
00:00:55,599 --> 00:01:00,080
number six is what we'd refer to as another one of those warning passages that are found in the

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,080
book of Hebrews. And this particular warning passage, we have noted how the recipients were

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,919
confronted. They were confronted with their spiritual immaturity. The fact that they were

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,160
saved, but they were not growing. They were immature. They could not receive the things that

14
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,279
the writer wanted to give them because they were dull of hearing and the time that they ought to

15
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:28,160
be teachers, they had need that one teach them. And they were confronted on their spiritual

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,720
immaturity. We made the note as we studied the last part of chapter number five, as you would

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,639
make a comparison between these recipients here in the book of Hebrews and those over in the book

18
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:43,599
of first Corinthians, where the church in Corinth, they were a carnal church. They were not able to

19
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,919
receive the things that the apostle Paul wanted to give them. And their carnality was seen through

20
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:54,559
their envying and their strife and their division. And all of that is noted in the book of first

21
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:58,720
Corinthians. And so we find that they were confronted with their spiritual immaturity,

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,120
and then they were challenged to go on to spiritual maturity. We noticed in chapter number

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,119
six and verse number one, that the writer says, therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine

24
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:17,440
of Christ notice, let us go on unto perfection. And that idea of spiritual maturity last week,

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,119
as we looked at the passage of scripture in verses nine through 12, we noted that there

26
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:28,960
should be evidence that supports not only our salvation, but really our sanctification.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,399
And that evidence ought to be, it should be in our lives. It ought to be there. We find that

28
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:40,880
the apostle, as he's writing this letter, it says, and things that accompany salvation,

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,399
that evidence of our conversion, the evidence of our sanctification. As we conclude the warning

30
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:52,160
passage, we'll look at it this morning in verses 13 through 20. Really, we find that this passage

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,839
of scripture would be an encouragement to the believers and encouragement to continue and

32
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:03,600
encouragement to endure. You remember last week, as we had mentioned in verse number 12, that you

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,919
be not slothful. Let me read verse 11 with it. And we desire that every one of you do show the same

34
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:16,639
diligence to the full assurance of hope, notice, unto the end. We spoke about the importance of

35
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,520
continuing. We mentioned about those that had left us examples, as he mentions about the

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,039
followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises, as we know in verse number

37
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,919
12. And we'd mentioned how there are so many examples that have gone before us. And I asked

38
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,440
this question at the end of message, who could look at us as an example? Who could look at your

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,960
life as being an example that would be worthy to follow? And we find that there's some encouragement

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:50,960
here in verses 13 through 20 with this idea of enduring, of continuing. There will be challenges

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,119
and obstacles in the Christian life. Amen? There will be. There will be weeks, days where we deal

42
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:05,119
with a greater number of challenges and obstacles maybe than we had dealt with earlier. But the

43
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:11,759
reality is that we must keep our eyes on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and we must rest in his

44
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,040
promises. I'm so thankful for the promises of God. And really, as we look at this passage of

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,239
Scripture, you'll see many references to the promises. Remember, at the end of verse number 12,

46
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:27,519
inherit the promises. And it really leads us into the text of Scripture that we're looking at this

47
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,279
morning. In verse 13, it says, for when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no

48
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,519
greater, he swear by himself. Isn't that good? There's no one greater than God. He is the Lord

49
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:47,119
God omnipotent. You go into a court of law, and you're going to be under oath, and you will

50
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:52,799
recite some words that used to be, so help me God. And I know that in some areas and instances

51
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:58,079
that's been changed. But the reality is, the idea of that oath is that you're swearing by a

52
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,880
higher power. There's no greater power than God. The Bible says that because he could swear by no

53
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,959
greater, he swear by himself, saying, verse 14, surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying

54
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,839
I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,640
For man verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,959
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his

57
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,839
counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for

58
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:42,320
God to lie. Aren't you thankful for that? It says that we might have a strong consolation,

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,320
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us, which hope we have as an anchor

60
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,440
of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil, whether the

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:05,839
forerunner is for us entered. Even Jesus, made an high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

62
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,519
You find that in verse number 20, really he's going back to what he had shared in chapter number

63
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:18,880
five, verses one through ten, that Jesus is a high priest after the order of Melchizedek,

64
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,399
not after the Aaronic priesthood. And we find here that in chapter number seven and eight, he's

65
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,239
going to continue to expound upon those things, and we find that he's going to make that transition

66
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:36,160
back in verse number 20 to the thought at hand that he had left in chapter number five.

67
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Why did he leave it? Remember, he said that he had many things to say, verse number 11 of chapter five,

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,880
of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing your dull of hearing. And so before

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,920
he gave all of the instruction with regard to Jesus being a high priest after the order of

70
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Melchizedek, he gives this warning. He confronts them, he challenges them, and now we find the

71
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,640
encouragement, the title for the message, if you're taking notes, we have an anchor. You see in verse

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,480
number 19, and of course it's a familiar hymn that we sing, number 516 in our hymnal, not that you

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,880
have a hymnal in front of you, but I'm just going to read the words of this song.

74
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,799
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life? When the clouds unfold their wings of strife,

75
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:31,760
when the strong tides lift and the cables strain, will your anchor drift or firm remain? It is

76
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,959
safely moored till the storm would stand, for it is well secured by the Savior's hand. And the cables

77
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:45,519
passed from his heart to mine can defy that blast through strength divine. It will firmly hold in

78
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,040
the straits of fear when the breakers have told the reef is near. Though the tempest rave and

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,480
the wild winds blow, not an angry wave shall bark or flow. When our eyes behold through the gathering

80
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,640
night, the city of gold, our harbor bright, we shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore,

81
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,040
with the storms all past forevermore. We have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure

82
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:21,839
while the billows roll, fastened to the rock which cannot move, grounded firm and deep in the Savior's

83
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,359
love. Isn't that a wonderful hymn? And this morning as we look at this passage of scripture, we

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,880
have an anchor. I want you to notice, first of all, if you're taking notes, the example of Abraham.

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,520
In verses 13 through 16—we've just read the verses, I will not reread them at this moment—but

86
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,719
we find that there is an example given. It's the example of Abraham. Again, the writer of Hebrews

87
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,080
uses an example that the reader could easily relate to. We've noticed that throughout the

88
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,520
book of Hebrews. We mentioned how the thought of the book of Hebrews that Christ is superior,

89
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,880
and he's superior to the prophets, he's superior than the angels, he's superior to Moses,

90
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,960
he's superior in his priesthood, and we noticed all of those things as we've studied through the

91
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,960
book of Hebrews. And as we study, we find that the people, the Jewish believers that are being

92
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,239
written to, that they would be able to identify with that which is being spoken of, with the

93
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:24,400
examples that are being used. And now we find that we come to this example of Abraham that is given.

94
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,479
He says about Abraham and using the example—it's interesting, by the way, during the life and

95
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:35,520
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, it was in John chapter 8, when he was speaking to the Pharisees,

96
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,080
some of the religious leaders of the day, and on two occasions in that particular passage

97
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,200
of Scripture, in verse 33 and again in verse number 39, those religious leaders claimed to

98
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,719
be Abraham's seed. And they made that claim. They understood some things about Abraham,

99
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:54,799
but you'll remember at the end of the passage, it was Jesus that said,

100
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,840
before Abraham was, I am. And what a great power!

101
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,560
truth that the Lord Jesus Christ was given with regard to his eternality, the

102
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,280
fact that he is God. We find here in the passage of Scripture that as he uses the

103
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,800
example of Abraham, he's speaking about this subject of promise. And notice it

104
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,360
tells us in verse number 13 that God made promise to Abraham. Notice it says

105
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,280
for when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he

106
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,440
swear by himself. We'll note that these verses of Scripture in verse 13 and 14

107
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,560
would be referenced back to Genesis chapter 22 verses 16 and 17. And it's in

108
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,560
that passage of Scripture that we read, of course, after the instruction that

109
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,400
Abraham had received with regard to sacrificing his own son and all that

110
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,000
would take place and how God had provided. Jehovah Jireh is what Abraham

111
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,040
called the place, God who provides, what a blessing. But we find that it's in

112
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,840
verse number 16 that God speaks back, and it says here, and said,

113
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,160
by myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing and

114
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,000
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,920
in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the

116
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,400
sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his

117
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,920
enemies. Now it's interesting that we would understand about the fact that God

118
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,480
made promise to Abraham. If you were to read several chapters earlier in the

119
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,040
book of Genesis, in Genesis chapter number 15, you read the Abrahamic

120
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,280
covenant, as we often would refer to it as. And we find that in that covenant God

121
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,520
made promise to Abraham, and the promise really dealt with the seed and the land.

122
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,440
The book of Joshua we've been studying throughout the weeks of this pandemic,

123
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,280
and we've noted how that the book of Joshua provides us with the historical

124
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,000
account of the entrance into, conquering of, and eventually the inhabiting of the

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,220
land. We're not quite done with the conquering of in our study, but we will

126
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,760
soon get there. And we find that as we understand the promise that was made to

127
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,700
Abraham in that Abrahamic covenant in Genesis chapter number 15, with regard to

128
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,460
the seed and the land, but as we note here in Hebrews chapter number 6, that as

129
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,660
he refers back to Genesis chapter 22, it helps us to find specifically the

130
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,580
promise in which is being dealt with, and it's the promise of the seed. It's

131
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,040
important that we note that. We'll look at the book of Galatians here in just a

132
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,660
moment, but we find that, again, dealing with the example of Abraham, God made a

133
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,740
promise to Abraham. I don't think any of us could deny that. We understand that

134
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,900
God made promise to Abraham, and Abraham, according to verse number 15, patiently

135
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,500
endured. Now, it's sometimes challenging for us to wait, is it not? God's given

136
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,860
promises, and we say, okay, hurry up, Lord, we're ready for that, we're ready for

137
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,140
this. And we find that the Bible says, and so after he had patiently endured, in

138
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,380
verse number 15, he obtained the promise. And so as we think about the example of

139
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,020
Abraham, we find that God made promise to Abraham. It's referred to in these

140
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,260
verses with regard to the specifics of the promise in chapter 22, verses 16 and

141
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,340
17, that he's dealing with the seed. But you know, the promise that was given in

142
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,220
chapter 15 with regard to a son, it took a while before he received that promise,

143
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,220
did it not? And the Bible says that he patiently endured, and then it says this,

144
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,820
he obtained the promise. If you're back in the book of Genesis again, you find

145
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,820
that it was in chapter number 15, as God is speaking to Abraham and giving him

146
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,460
this wonderful truth and this promise. Remember, it was Abraham that said, in

147
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,020
verse number 12, and he's still referred to as Abraham at this particular time, it

148
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,020
says,

149
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:16,620
But we find that the Lord responds in verse 4 of Genesis 15 and said,

150
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:29,820
You notice, of course, there are several events that

151
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,700
take place between God giving this promise and, of course, many visits from

152
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,660
God reassuring Abraham of the promise, but it's not until chapter 21 where you

153
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,140
see the birth of Isaac. And you find that in verse number 1, the Bible says this of

154
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,700
Genesis 21,

155
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,780
As he said, aren't those precious words? Because God always does what he says he

156
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,860
will do. We may have to patiently endure, we may not get it exactly when we think

157
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,620
it's going to come, but we find that God always does what God says he will do.

158
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,860
And the Bible says,

159
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,060
As he had spoken. As he said, as he had spoken. It says in verse 2,

160
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,380
For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of

161
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,780
which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born

162
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:29,620
unto him, whom Sarah bare to him Isaac. What a blessing! You come to chapter 22

163
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,100
and you find the instruction to take and to offer Isaac to the Lord. It says,

164
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,220
Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, in verse 2 of chapter 22, whom thou

165
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,340
lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt

166
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,420
offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. We find that

167
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,700
Abraham obeyed. He went and God provided. Remember, it was Isaac that said, My

168
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,340
father, he said, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

169
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,420
And Abraham said, he said, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt

170
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,740
offering. What great faith! We find that it's within the context of these

171
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,660
passages of Scripture that the example is used here in the book of Hebrews of

172
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,220
Abraham and how, yes, that promise had been given. Again, the Jewish believers, I

173
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,260
mean, as we understand the truth of the book of Genesis and we can relate to the

174
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,980
instruction that had been given to Abraham and how he patiently endured and

175
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,780
all of those things, no doubt these Jewish believers would easily be able to

176
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,220
relate to that which would be spoken to them here with regard to the example of

177
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,460
Abraham. It's important that we know as we interpret Scripture with Scripture and

178
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,020
Galatians chapter number three. I'm not planning to go back to the book of

179
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,660
Genesis, so you don't need to go there or keep your place there, but look over in

180
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,260
Galatians chapter number three, if you will, because I want to speak to you

181
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,060
about this promise of a seed. Yes, there's a promise of seed and land, but we find

182
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,860
that as we consider the example of Abraham here, as we make the transition

183
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,040
between using an example and then giving the believers some instruction, as we

184
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,920
find in the next several verses of Hebrews 6, we find that it's important

185
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,520
that we understand that we would be the ones that are referenced there in verse

186
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,720
17 of Hebrews 6, unto the heirs of promise. Notice in Galatians 3,

187
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,840
in verse number 6, even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him

188
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,040
for righteousness, know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same

189
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,000
are the children of Abraham. It says in verse number 8 in the Scripture, for

190
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,560
seeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before

191
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,480
the gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then

192
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,440
they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many, verse 10,

193
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,000
as are of the works of the law are under the curse. For it is written, cursed is

194
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,080
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of

195
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,640
the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God.

196
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,680
It is evident, for the just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith, but

197
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,600
the man that doeth them shall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the

198
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,920
curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone

199
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,240
that hangeth on a tree. Notice that the blessing of Abraham might come on the

200
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Gentiles, how? Through Jesus Christ. That we might receive the promise of the

201
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,160
Spirit through faith. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men, though it be

202
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,880
but a man's covenant. Yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth

203
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:59,280
thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promise made. He sayeth not, and to

204
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:10,080
seeds, as of many, but as of one. And to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say,

205
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,200
that the covenant that was confirmed before of God and Christ, the law, which

206
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,559
was 430 years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the

207
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,480
promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more

208
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,440
of promise, but God gave it to Abraham, how? By promise. And so as we come to

209
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,360
Hebrews chapter number 6 and we see, for when God made promise to Abraham, and we

210
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,920
think about the truth of that which is being given to us here, and he gives us

211
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,680
the truth of Genesis 22, the truth of Genesis 15, and then the truth of

212
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,559
Galatians 3, as we put all of these things together and we understand the

213
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,559
example here of this one Abraham, that God had made promise to him. That

214
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,880
Abraham patiently endured, but then a

215
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,760
Abraham, as we find at the end of verse number 15, he obtained the promise.

216
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,120
Of course, that son, Isaac, that was born, and of course, you follow the lineage, if

217
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,480
you will, and you see the seed being Christ.

218
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,760
It's interesting to note, as you study throughout the Old Testament, so many evils that are

219
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,600
given against the nation of Israel, and so many battles and people groups that come against

220
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,760
them, you find that throughout the history, that really what's happening is Satan is working

221
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,040
to destroy the line that Messiah would come from.

222
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,280
That's what you find.

223
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Why was it that Haman said, we're going to destroy all of the Jews?

224
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,000
Satan is working.

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,800
See, there is an evil that is taking place in our world, even still today, and we understand

226
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,640
that we are engaged in spiritual battle, spiritual warfare.

227
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,800
Far too often, what happens is we look at some person as being the enemy, instead of

228
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,320
us understanding who the true enemy is.

229
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm speaking as a child of God this morning, and as a child of God, we must understand

230
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,600
when there's, listen, you understand the devil wants to destroy your home, but you understand

231
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,760
that your wife or your husband isn't your enemy.

232
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,080
Satan is the enemy.

233
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,720
He's the one that wants to destroy your home, and we could use illustration after illustration,

234
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,840
example after example, but we find that as we would understand these things that had

235
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,520
happened in the Old Testament, and how they come to pass, and we come to verse 17 of Hebrews

236
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
6, and it says,

237
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,840
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the, notice this, the heirs of promise,

238
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,860
the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath.

239
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,840
The reality is that God didn't have to confirm anything by an oath.

240
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,200
He did because it was human, it was part of the customs of humans to do that sort of thing.

241
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,520
Have you ever had somebody say, do you promise?

242
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,040
You buy something, and you're going to sign something, you make this thing that you sign,

243
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,279
and you've entered into an agreement, a contract, it's binding, and there's all sorts of legal

244
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:19,279
language that is used in it to show you what the responsibilities of the parties are, and

245
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,600
we find that God, listen, his word is enough.

246
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:31,120
But in order to show the sureness of his promise, he took this step, as we find in

247
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,400
verse 16 and 17, notice, he says,

248
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,840
For men verily swear by the greater, but remember, there is no one greater than God.

249
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,200
He could not appeal to a greater power, he is the greatest power, but in order to help

250
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,520
man understand, it says that an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, wherein God,

251
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,840
appealing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise, notice this, the immutability

252
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,400
of his counsel confirmed it, how?

253
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
By an oath.

254
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,720
You read the end of Genesis chapter number 15, Abraham sleeping, when it passes through

255
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,040
the animals that have been set apart, and you see the reality of God making this promise,

256
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,600
and he says in verse 18 that by two immutable things, that word immutable, unchanging, right?

257
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,080
When we speak about the immutability of God, I'm so thankful that our God is the same yesterday

258
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,440
and today and forever.

259
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,919
He said in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not.

260
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,800
We can't say that, amen?

261
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,400
We change sometimes multiple times in the same day, amen?

262
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,279
I mean, sometimes we have good days, sometimes we have bad days, sometimes we have good moments

263
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:48,840
and we have bad moments, but God doesn't change, he is the same, and we find that it says that

264
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,080
by two immutable things, notice, in which it was impossible for God to lie.

265
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Paul mentioned this to Titus in Titus 1, you don't need to turn there, I'll read it to

266
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,480
you, but in verse number 2 it says, in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie

267
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,440
promised before the world began.

268
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,520
Our God cannot lie, he's not a man that he should lie, remember the situation in Numbers

269
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,600
between Balaam and Balak?

270
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,000
And you understand our God, he is ever the same and he cannot lie.

271
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,959
It says here that we might have a strong consolation, that word consolation, it means to comfort.

272
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:37,660
In fact, it's the same word that's often used to refer to the Holy Spirit, the comforter.

273
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,179
And what a joy to understand that he wants us to have this strong consolation, this comfort,

274
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:48,980
because he's given us these promises and he's proven the surety of the promise.

275
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:56,800
It says this, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

276
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,760
Now we find that he's speaking about the heirs of promise.

277
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,700
We understand as we look at Galatians chapter number 3 that he's speaking about those that

278
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,059
are redeemed, those that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

279
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,899
And we find that it's interesting that in the passage of Scripture in Galatians chapter

280
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:21,580
number 3, he's speaking of course to Gentiles and he makes it known here that the blessing

281
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,220
of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ.

282
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,980
Isn't that wonderful?

283
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,420
Salvation through Christ.

284
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
It's the only way.

285
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,179
We sang about what a glory I'm saved, right?

286
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,300
Saved, saved, what a blessing.

287
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I'm saved how?

288
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
By the blood of the crucified one.

289
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,220
It's the only way to be saved.

290
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,700
I've often said, and I don't want to get into all that's going on in our nation today, but

291
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,059
there's great division that is going on.

292
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,140
And I've often said throughout the years of ministry as I study the Word of God and I

293
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,140
understand the truth of God's Word, that the Word of God, that Jesus Christ, the Gospel

294
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,020
of Jesus Christ is the answer to man's problem.

295
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,220
There's so many problems in our nation today, divisions that are man-made, by the way.

296
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,300
And we find that those divisions that are man-made, we find that the Gospel is the healer.

297
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Why?

298
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,580
Because there's really only two categories of people, saved and lost.

299
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
That's it.

300
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Amen?

301
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,140
And we understand that as God has given us His Word and as He's speaking here, He's writing

302
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,779
to these believers and we take in context the entirety of this warning passage.

303
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,739
And He says, listen, I'm going to confront you on your spiritual immaturity.

304
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:42,020
I'm going to challenge you to spiritual maturity that you would grow, that you would go on

305
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,020
to perfection.

306
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,459
I'm going to share with you the evidences that ought to be in your life that would prove

307
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:53,860
your salvation, that would prove your sanctification, and I want to encourage you to endure.

308
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,459
See, the reality is that, as I mentioned at the very beginning of our study of the book

309
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:04,739
of Hebrews, the book is written to people that are ready to go back to Judaism.

310
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,380
They're looking to go back.

311
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,459
Remember in John chapter number six when Jesus is speaking there and all of those disciples

312
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:16,040
that had followed Him, they went away and Jesus says, are you going to go also?

313
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,660
And Peter stands up and says this, to whom shall we go?

314
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,300
He says that we know that thou art the Christ and that you have the words of eternal life.

315
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:31,940
And so we find that the writer of Hebrews is seeking to encourage these individuals.

316
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,059
Listen, they have been given promises.

317
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,980
We have been given promises.

318
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,520
Standing on the promises, we sing the song, we rejoice in the promises of God.

319
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,420
Can I tell you that for the child of God, we've not received every promise that's been

320
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,820
made to us.

321
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,940
I'm not yet in heaven, amen?

322
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,059
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

323
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,860
I have the promise that Christ is going to return.

324
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,559
I have the promise that I will be with Him forever.

325
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,420
But as we go through life, as these believers had received promise, He gives them the example

326
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
of Abraham.

327
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Why?

328
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,179
He received a promise but he didn't get it immediately.

329
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:11,179
He endured.

330
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,020
And he endured how?

331
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,619
With patience.

332
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:16,820
And then he obtained the promise.

333
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,980
And so we find that he's reminding these believers on how they need to continue and to endure.

334
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,820
So we've seen, first of all, notice the example of Abraham, number 2, in verses 17-20.

335
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,220
Notice the expectation of the redeemed.

336
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,400
The word hope is used in this passage of Scripture.

337
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,099
In verse 18, again in verse number 19, we see the word hope that is used and we understand

338
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:50,059
biblically speaking that the word hope, it's an expectation based upon God's gracious promises.

339
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,780
Hope is confidence.

340
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,979
It's an expectation.

341
00:28:54,979 --> 00:29:00,539
It's not like we so frequently use the word in our daily language today when we speak

342
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,500
about hoping for this or hoping for that.

343
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,859
But we find that when we deal with biblical hope, it is an expectation that is based upon

344
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:11,239
God's gracious promises.

345
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,580
I have this hope.

346
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,460
We speak about the blessed hope that Paul refers to in Titus.

347
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
What is he speaking about?

348
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,539
The return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

349
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,099
It is an expectation.

350
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:25,940
There is a confidence that we have as God's people that He is going to return.

351
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Why?

352
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Because He said He would.

353
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,500
And He's not slack concerning His promise.

354
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,099
And what a blessing it is for us to understand that.

355
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:37,340
We find that He says, as I've mentioned already there in verse number 18, that we might have

356
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,580
strong consolation.

357
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,900
And so we find that the recipients are given this word of comfort, of consolation, and

358
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,619
we find that they are given this promise and it's being explained to them that they could

359
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,020
have an expectation.

360
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,179
I'm so glad that this world is not all that there is for us.

361
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,179
Amen?

362
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:00,940
There's so much more.

363
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,340
And we find that the expectation is really illustrated in a few ways

364
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,860
here in the passage of Scripture.

365
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,580
Notice at the end of verse number 18, it says this,

366
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,780
we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge

367
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,740
to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

368
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,620
I want to remind you this morning that God is our refuge.

369
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,540
He's our refuge.

370
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,580
In fact, the psalmist often cried out a verse that we dealt with,

371
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,220
really a psalm that we dealt with a couple of months ago

372
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
in one of our prayer meetings.

373
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,140
In Psalm 46, in verse number 1,

374
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:47,340
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

375
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,260
He continues in verse 2 and says,

376
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,380
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed

377
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,100
and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea,

378
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,340
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,

379
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,380
though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

380
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,660
Selah.

381
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,580
See, God is our refuge.

382
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,180
And we find this picture that is given,

383
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,459
we'd be reminded of what the psalmist said,

384
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:15,740
but we'd also understand of that which is in view here,

385
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,100
really, we think about the cities of refuge.

386
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,980
We haven't quite gotten there yet in our study of the book of Joshua,

387
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
but as we get through the book of Joshua,

388
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,819
you understand as the land is divided

389
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:28,380
and the tribes receive their inheritance,

390
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,980
that there are cities of refuge.

391
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,420
There were six of them,

392
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,180
three on the eastern side of the Jordan,

393
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,940
three on the western side of Jordan,

394
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,459
and they were strategically located

395
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:39,580
as God had instructed them to place those cities of refuge.

396
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,819
It was interesting, if someone would kill somebody unawares,

397
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,980
it was not a premeditated murder,

398
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,420
it was some type of an accident,

399
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,540
they could flee to a city of refuge,

400
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,380
and as they would flee to the city of refuge,

401
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,580
they would have security within that city.

402
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,260
The people of that city had a responsibility

403
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,660
to provide a refuge, a place of safety for them,

404
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,020
and you find there would be a hearing

405
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,459
and all sorts of things that would go on,

406
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:07,980
if they were guilty, then they were guilty,

407
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,260
they'd be put to death if it was,

408
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,300
in fact, a premeditated type of a thing.

409
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,419
But we find that if it truly was an accident,

410
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,660
that they'd have to stay there until when?

411
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,380
The death of the priest.

412
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,220
And when the priest died, they could return back.

413
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,900
Now, it's interesting because God is our refuge,

414
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,619
the Lord Jesus Christ is our refuge,

415
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,020
and as we've often mentioned,

416
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,419
and we'll get into even more of this

417
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,059
as we've spoken about the death of our Savior,

418
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,220
our high priest, but he rose again.

419
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,580
He conquered sin, death, and the grave.

420
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,419
We referenced in chapter number seven a few weeks ago

421
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:51,180
how that he has this unchangeable priesthood.

422
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,660
Why?

423
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Because he continueth ever.

424
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,300
And we find here that God is our refuge,

425
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,380
and what a joy to understand that.

426
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,820
And the encouragement that's coming to these believers,

427
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,979
he's saying, listen, there's an expectation

428
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,860
that you ought to have as a redeemed person.

429
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
And he speaks about God being our refuge.

430
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,339
Number two, he speaks about the fact

431
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,500
that he, God, is our anchor.

432
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,220
Notice in verse 19,

433
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,740
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul,

434
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,139
both sure and steadfast,

435
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:28,380
in which entereth into that within the veil.

436
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,339
Isn't that precious?

437
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,020
We think about the fact that we have an anchor.

438
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,940
We use that as our title.

439
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,419
We've read the words of the songwriter

440
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:40,460
that he shared in penning those words,

441
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,500
no doubt inspired from this truth of Hebrews 6.

442
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,940
In verse number 19,

443
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,300
and we'd understand that this anchor that we have,

444
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,580
this anchor of the soul,

445
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
that it's sure and steadfast,

446
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,100
but notice it says,

447
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,419
which entereth into that within the veil.

448
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:00,860
Remember, as we continue to use the example

449
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,740
of all that's taking place of the priesthood

450
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,860
and all of those things,

451
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,100
we find that in chapter number 14,

452
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,779
and excuse me, in chapter number four,

453
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:10,940
in verse number 14 of the book of Hebrews,

454
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,460
that the writer says this,

455
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,419
seeing then that we have a great high priest

456
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,260
that is passed into the heavens,

457
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Jesus, the son of God,

458
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,540
let us hold fast our profession.

459
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:25,500
For we have not an high priest

460
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,660
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,

461
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,899
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

462
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,820
yet without sin.

463
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,220
And we find that He, our Savior, our anchor,

464
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,980
the anchor of our soul,

465
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,500
that it's sure and steadfast,

466
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,860
and that He is in heaven.

467
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,380
Right?

468
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,820
It's interesting about the priest.

469
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,380
The priest could go and make offering for the people,

470
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,860
but he could not lead the people

471
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,500
into the place where the offering would be made.

472
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,820
We find that Jesus,

473
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,739
He entereth into that within the veil.

474
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,299
He is seated in the heavenlies.

475
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,459
We understand that He's sitting upon His throne.

476
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:05,019
We understand that the Bible teaches us

477
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,019
in chapter number 10 of this same book,

478
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:07,980
in verse number 12,

479
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,019
but this man,

480
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:11,820
after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

481
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,940
sat down on the right hand of God.

482
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,140
He's our refuge.

483
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:19,739
He's our anchor.

484
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,459
He is our forerunner.

485
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:23,739
Notice in verse number 20,

486
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,700
the Bible says this,

487
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,980
whither the forerunner is for us entered,

488
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,220
even Jesus, made an high priest forever

489
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,899
after the order of Melchizedek.

490
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:39,820
As we think about the truth

491
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,899
that is given to us in verse number 20

492
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:44,779
with regard to the usage of this word forerunner,

493
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,059
it's an interesting word.

494
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:50,220
It means one who comes in advance to a place

495
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,260
where the rest are to follow.

496
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,700
I like that.

497
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,220
One who comes in advance to a place

498
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,220
where the rest are to follow.

499
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,179
Where's that place?

500
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,619
In heaven.

501
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:05,899
It says,

502
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:08,140
in which entereth into that within the veil

503
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,580
at the end of verse number 19,

504
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,700
whither the forerunner is for us entered,

505
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,299
even Jesus, made an high priest forever

506
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,140
after the order of Melchizedek.

507
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
As we look at the passage of Scripture

508
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,100
and we conclude the warning section

509
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,059
that is given to these Jewish believers,

510
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,820
again, a group of people that

511
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,899
because of the intense persecution,

512
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,820
because of all that they were dealing with,

513
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,860
because of the time in which they were living

514
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,299
and the temple was still standing

515
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,140
and sacrifices were still being made

516
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,739
and they're dealing with all of those things

517
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,619
and they were dealing with this level of persecution,

518
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,299
there was a thought on the mind

519
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,500
of some of these believers

520
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
that they would just return to Judaism.

521
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,700
And we find that the writer of Hebrews says,

522
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
no, Jesus is superior.

523
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,899
He begins that immediately in chapter number one

524
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,220
and he deals with how Christ is superior

525
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
throughout those first several chapters.

526
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
And in this particular warning,

527
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,059
as he's giving the expectation to these redeemed,

528
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,700
he's saying, listen, you need to understand something.

529
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,339
Let me remind you of Abraham.

530
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,619
Let me remind you how God made promise to Abraham,

531
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,019
but he didn't receive it immediately.

532
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:20,860
And in like manner, as you have received promise,

533
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,179
you can be assured of the promise that God has made.

534
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:29,100
You can stand on the promises of God's Word.

535
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:29,660
Amen.

536
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,739
We find that Peter said that they were exceeding

537
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,660
great and precious promises.

538
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,619
What a great truth that is given to us

539
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:41,660
with regard to that reference.

540
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,220
I see Peter making that statement

541
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,500
and what a joy it is.

542
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,299
We find that Paul said this in 2 Corinthians 1,

543
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,339
in verse number 20,

544
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:53,179
for all the promises of God in him are yea,

545
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:59,179
and in him amen unto the glory of God by us.

546
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,899
But you don't understand my circumstances.

547
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:03,339
You don't understand what I'm dealing with

548
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,100
and you don't know how hard it is.

549
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,019
These people were dealing with some very hard times.

550
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,779
What did the writer remind them of?

551
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:11,820
Remember the promises.

552
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,860
Remember there's an expectant end.

553
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,140
This world is not all there is to offer.

554
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,619
Sometimes we get so caught up in the problems

555
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:22,380
and the affairs of this world

556
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,619
and we get underneath of them

557
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,619
and we get burdened down by them

558
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,980
and we get our eyes and our vision on those things.

559
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,580
And Paul said in that book,

560
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,700
2 Corinthians chapter 4,

561
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,020
he says,

562
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,419
while we look not at the things which are temporal,

563
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:37,659
and in verse number 18 of that fourth chapter,

564
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:37,979
he says,

565
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,900
but things which are eternal.

566
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,700
Amen.

567
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,419
And the reality is that these believers

568
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:44,780
who had been struggling,

569
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,700
who were dealing with difficulty,

570
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,059
we find that the expectation of these believers

571
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:51,419
is illustrated for them

572
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:54,460
that we have that God is our refuge.

573
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,859
That we have an anchor that it's sure and steadfast

574
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,820
that He's our forerunner.

575
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,780
That He's already gone to provide the way.

576
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
The forerunner would be used often

577
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,099
in a number of different ways.

578
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,580
We use the military canvassing situation.

579
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
He'd go before and if there were obstacles,

580
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,979
if there were terrain difficulties,

581
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:21,659
they would understand what was going on

582
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,539
and they would come back and provide direction

583
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:27,179
for how the rest of the group was to travel.

584
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:29,099
And we find that as I've mentioned already,

585
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,380
the Old Testament priest,

586
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,179
he could not lead the people into the holy place,

587
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,020
but we find that Jesus as our great high priest,

588
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,580
that He in fact has made the way.

589
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:42,619
Remember what Jesus said in John 14,

590
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:43,739
in verse number 6,

591
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,859
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

592
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:53,500
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

593
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,059
I'm so thankful that He made a way,

594
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:58,299
that He is the way.

595
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,780
And these believers and...

596
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,340
they could easily relate to Abraham and they could understand the struggles. I

597
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,980
mean if you read from chapter 15 to chapter 21 and you read some of the

598
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,380
things that took place and you read about the laughter and you read about

599
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380
the situation with Ishmael and you read about all of those things and you

600
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,460
understand what's taking place and as a Jewish believer you have this heritage

601
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,500
as being the seed of Abraham physically speaking they could relate and

602
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,980
understand Abraham received a promise but he didn't obtain a promise

603
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:41,140
immediately he endured with patience and now as us as believers we understand the

604
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,460
application from Galatians 3 that it's of that seed speaking spiritually

605
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:53,380
because it's through Christ and we are the heirs of promise we can rejoice this

606
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,140
morning in the promises of God I don't know what difficulty or challenge you're

607
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,780
dealing with but I do know that God's Word has the answer and I do know that

608
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:11,220
God he will provide us with the strength that we need he will give us the grace

609
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,900
remember what Paul said as he besought the Lord thrice in 2nd Corinthians

610
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,540
chapter number 12 for that infirmity that he dealt with that thorn in his

611
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:26,500
flesh and the Bible tells us that God replied and said no why because my grace

612
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,420
is sufficient for thee I wonder this morning as we deal with things even as

613
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,580
these believers in the first century that are receiving this book of Hebrews

614
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:47,300
I wonder if there are times in which we struggle with the thought of can we go

615
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,420
any further I mean look at all of these obstacles and these challenges I'm

616
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,980
dealing with can I remind you to turn to the promises of God can I remind you

617
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,020
this morning that we are to endure can I remind you this morning that his grace

618
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:07,060
is sufficient and I just wonder this morning in my life in your life have we

619
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:13,820
found it to be so have we found that his grace indeed is sufficient God is not a

620
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,500
liar he said that it would be sufficient and as we rest in him listen we sing the

621
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,380
song amazing grace oh what a great song his grace is abundant toward me Paul's

622
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:32,940
testimony and this morning let us be reminded we have an anchor it's

623
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,900
illustrated that way at the end in verse 19 of Hebrews 6 and these believers that

624
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,820
the writer is encouraging keep on go on to spiritual maturity don't give up

625
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:49,380
don't turn back go on for us this morning let us keep our eyes on Jesus

626
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:56,340
let us endure with patience let us understand that his promises are sure

627
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,620
father we love you this morning we thank you for loving us we thank you for thy

628
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,500
word the truth that's contained therein we thank you for the examples that you

629
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:12,340
given us in your word we thank you for how this passage of Scripture this

630
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:21,780
warning section for these believers how it concludes reminding these believers

631
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:30,100
of the promises that have been given to us we're so thankful that this mortal

632
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:37,420
shall put on immortality that this world is not our home we have the promise and

633
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,580
the certainty of heaven not because of our own righteousness but because of

634
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,260
redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ through the blood that was shed

635
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,820
through his death burial and glorious resurrection I pray this morning they

636
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,300
would help us to understand the expectation of the redeemed you'd help

637
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,380
us to understand that though we deal with trials and obstacles and challenges

638
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,740
in this world that this world is not my home help us to look on the eternal and

639
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:13,180
not the temporal help us to rest in the fact that you are the way the truth and

640
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,780
the life and that your grace indeed is sufficient if there's one that does not

641
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,740
know you as their personal Lord and Savior it's our prayer that today before

642
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,220
it's eternally too late they would trust Christ as their Savior for those that
