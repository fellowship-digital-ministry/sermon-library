WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.199
day and night, forever and ever. Amen. And he is a defeated foe. He's a foe,

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:12.479
but he's a defeated foe. Amen. And what a wonderful song. So thankful for redemption

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:17.280
through the blood of Jesus Christ. Hebrews chapter number six this morning, Hebrews chapter number

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.000
six. And as you're turning there, I'm going to read, I'm going to read a passage of scripture

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.600
to you. And then I'm going to read you the words of a familiar hymn. Hebrews chapter number six.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:38.159
We've been making our way through the book of Hebrews, of course, here in 2020. And we are

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:44.880
going to finish the sixth chapter this morning and we're making progress. This of course is the last

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.919
section of this warning that we're in the midst of. We've had several messages now at the end of

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.599
chapter number five, really beginning in verse number 11, all the way through the end of chapter

00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.080
number six is what we'd refer to as another one of those warning passages that are found in the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.080
book of Hebrews. And this particular warning passage, we have noted how the recipients were

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.919
confronted. They were confronted with their spiritual immaturity. The fact that they were

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.160
saved, but they were not growing. They were immature. They could not receive the things that

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:23.279
the writer wanted to give them because they were dull of hearing and the time that they ought to

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:28.160
be teachers, they had need that one teach them. And they were confronted on their spiritual

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.720
immaturity. We made the note as we studied the last part of chapter number five, as you would

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.639
make a comparison between these recipients here in the book of Hebrews and those over in the book

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.599
of first Corinthians, where the church in Corinth, they were a carnal church. They were not able to

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.919
receive the things that the apostle Paul wanted to give them. And their carnality was seen through

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:54.559
their envying and their strife and their division. And all of that is noted in the book of first

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:58.720
Corinthians. And so we find that they were confronted with their spiritual immaturity,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.120
and then they were challenged to go on to spiritual maturity. We noticed in chapter number

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.119
six and verse number one, that the writer says, therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.440
of Christ notice, let us go on unto perfection. And that idea of spiritual maturity last week,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.119
as we looked at the passage of scripture in verses nine through 12, we noted that there

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:28.960
should be evidence that supports not only our salvation, but really our sanctification.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.399
And that evidence ought to be, it should be in our lives. It ought to be there. We find that

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:40.880
the apostle, as he's writing this letter, it says, and things that accompany salvation,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.399
that evidence of our conversion, the evidence of our sanctification. As we conclude the warning

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:52.160
passage, we'll look at it this morning in verses 13 through 20. Really, we find that this passage

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.839
of scripture would be an encouragement to the believers and encouragement to continue and

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:03.600
encouragement to endure. You remember last week, as we had mentioned in verse number 12, that you

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.919
be not slothful. Let me read verse 11 with it. And we desire that every one of you do show the same

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:16.639
diligence to the full assurance of hope, notice, unto the end. We spoke about the importance of

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.520
continuing. We mentioned about those that had left us examples, as he mentions about the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.039
followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises, as we know in verse number

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.919
12. And we'd mentioned how there are so many examples that have gone before us. And I asked

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.440
this question at the end of message, who could look at us as an example? Who could look at your

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.960
life as being an example that would be worthy to follow? And we find that there's some encouragement

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.960
here in verses 13 through 20 with this idea of enduring, of continuing. There will be challenges

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.119
and obstacles in the Christian life. Amen? There will be. There will be weeks, days where we deal

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:05.119
with a greater number of challenges and obstacles maybe than we had dealt with earlier. But the

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:11.759
reality is that we must keep our eyes on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and we must rest in his

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:17.040
promises. I'm so thankful for the promises of God. And really, as we look at this passage of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.239
Scripture, you'll see many references to the promises. Remember, at the end of verse number 12,

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:27.519
inherit the promises. And it really leads us into the text of Scripture that we're looking at this

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:33.279
morning. In verse 13, it says, for when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:39.519
greater, he swear by himself. Isn't that good? There's no one greater than God. He is the Lord

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:47.119
God omnipotent. You go into a court of law, and you're going to be under oath, and you will

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:52.799
recite some words that used to be, so help me God. And I know that in some areas and instances

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:58.079
that's been changed. But the reality is, the idea of that oath is that you're swearing by a

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:04.880
higher power. There's no greater power than God. The Bible says that because he could swear by no

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.959
greater, he swear by himself, saying, verse 14, surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.839
I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.640
For man verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.959
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:35.839
counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:42.320
God to lie. Aren't you thankful for that? It says that we might have a strong consolation,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:50.320
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us, which hope we have as an anchor

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.440
of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil, whether the

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:05.839
forerunner is for us entered. Even Jesus, made an high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:11.519
You find that in verse number 20, really he's going back to what he had shared in chapter number

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:18.880
five, verses one through ten, that Jesus is a high priest after the order of Melchizedek,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.399
not after the Aaronic priesthood. And we find here that in chapter number seven and eight, he's

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:30.239
going to continue to expound upon those things, and we find that he's going to make that transition

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:36.160
back in verse number 20 to the thought at hand that he had left in chapter number five.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.600
Why did he leave it? Remember, he said that he had many things to say, verse number 11 of chapter five,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.880
of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing your dull of hearing. And so before

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.920
he gave all of the instruction with regard to Jesus being a high priest after the order of

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.880
Melchizedek, he gives this warning. He confronts them, he challenges them, and now we find the

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640
encouragement, the title for the message, if you're taking notes, we have an anchor. You see in verse

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.480
number 19, and of course it's a familiar hymn that we sing, number 516 in our hymnal, not that you

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.880
have a hymnal in front of you, but I'm just going to read the words of this song.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.799
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life? When the clouds unfold their wings of strife,

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:31.760
when the strong tides lift and the cables strain, will your anchor drift or firm remain? It is

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.959
safely moored till the storm would stand, for it is well secured by the Savior's hand. And the cables

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:45.519
passed from his heart to mine can defy that blast through strength divine. It will firmly hold in

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:51.040
the straits of fear when the breakers have told the reef is near. Though the tempest rave and

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:58.480
the wild winds blow, not an angry wave shall bark or flow. When our eyes behold through the gathering

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.640
night, the city of gold, our harbor bright, we shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:13.040
with the storms all past forevermore. We have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:21.839
while the billows roll, fastened to the rock which cannot move, grounded firm and deep in the Savior's

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:27.359
love. Isn't that a wonderful hymn? And this morning as we look at this passage of scripture, we

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.880
have an anchor. I want you to notice, first of all, if you're taking notes, the example of Abraham.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.520
In verses 13 through 16—we've just read the verses, I will not reread them at this moment—but

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.719
we find that there is an example given. It's the example of Abraham. Again, the writer of Hebrews

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:48.080
uses an example that the reader could easily relate to. We've noticed that throughout the

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:55.520
book of Hebrews. We mentioned how the thought of the book of Hebrews that Christ is superior,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.880
and he's superior to the prophets, he's superior than the angels, he's superior to Moses,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.960
he's superior in his priesthood, and we noticed all of those things as we've studied through the

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.960
book of Hebrews. And as we study, we find that the people, the Jewish believers that are being

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.239
written to, that they would be able to identify with that which is being spoken of, with the

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:24.400
examples that are being used. And now we find that we come to this example of Abraham that is given.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.479
He says about Abraham and using the example—it's interesting, by the way, during the life and

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:35.520
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, it was in John chapter 8, when he was speaking to the Pharisees,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.080
some of the religious leaders of the day, and on two occasions in that particular passage

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.200
of Scripture, in verse 33 and again in verse number 39, those religious leaders claimed to

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.719
be Abraham's seed. And they made that claim. They understood some things about Abraham,

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:54.799
but you'll remember at the end of the passage, it was Jesus that said,

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:59.840
before Abraham was, I am. And what a great power!

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.560
truth that the Lord Jesus Christ was given with regard to his eternality, the

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.280
fact that he is God. We find here in the passage of Scripture that as he uses the

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.800
example of Abraham, he's speaking about this subject of promise. And notice it

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.360
tells us in verse number 13 that God made promise to Abraham. Notice it says

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.280
for when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.440
swear by himself. We'll note that these verses of Scripture in verse 13 and 14

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.560
would be referenced back to Genesis chapter 22 verses 16 and 17. And it's in

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.560
that passage of Scripture that we read, of course, after the instruction that

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:47.400
Abraham had received with regard to sacrificing his own son and all that

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:53.000
would take place and how God had provided. Jehovah Jireh is what Abraham

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.040
called the place, God who provides, what a blessing. But we find that it's in

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.840
verse number 16 that God speaks back, and it says here, and said,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.160
by myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing and

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.000
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.920
in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.400
sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.920
enemies. Now it's interesting that we would understand about the fact that God

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.480
made promise to Abraham. If you were to read several chapters earlier in the

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.040
book of Genesis, in Genesis chapter number 15, you read the Abrahamic

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.280
covenant, as we often would refer to it as. And we find that in that covenant God

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.520
made promise to Abraham, and the promise really dealt with the seed and the land.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.440
The book of Joshua we've been studying throughout the weeks of this pandemic,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.280
and we've noted how that the book of Joshua provides us with the historical

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.000
account of the entrance into, conquering of, and eventually the inhabiting of the

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.220
land. We're not quite done with the conquering of in our study, but we will

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:09.760
soon get there. And we find that as we understand the promise that was made to

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.700
Abraham in that Abrahamic covenant in Genesis chapter number 15, with regard to

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.460
the seed and the land, but as we note here in Hebrews chapter number 6, that as

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:27.660
he refers back to Genesis chapter 22, it helps us to find specifically the

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.580
promise in which is being dealt with, and it's the promise of the seed. It's

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.040
important that we note that. We'll look at the book of Galatians here in just a

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.660
moment, but we find that, again, dealing with the example of Abraham, God made a

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.740
promise to Abraham. I don't think any of us could deny that. We understand that

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.900
God made promise to Abraham, and Abraham, according to verse number 15, patiently

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.500
endured. Now, it's sometimes challenging for us to wait, is it not? God's given

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.860
promises, and we say, okay, hurry up, Lord, we're ready for that, we're ready for

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.140
this. And we find that the Bible says, and so after he had patiently endured, in

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.380
verse number 15, he obtained the promise. And so as we think about the example of

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.020
Abraham, we find that God made promise to Abraham. It's referred to in these

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.260
verses with regard to the specifics of the promise in chapter 22, verses 16 and

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.340
17, that he's dealing with the seed. But you know, the promise that was given in

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.220
chapter 15 with regard to a son, it took a while before he received that promise,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.220
did it not? And the Bible says that he patiently endured, and then it says this,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.820
he obtained the promise. If you're back in the book of Genesis again, you find

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.820
that it was in chapter number 15, as God is speaking to Abraham and giving him

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.460
this wonderful truth and this promise. Remember, it was Abraham that said, in

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.020
verse number 12, and he's still referred to as Abraham at this particular time, it

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.020
says,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:16.620
But we find that the Lord responds in verse 4 of Genesis 15 and said,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:29.820
You notice, of course, there are several events that

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.700
take place between God giving this promise and, of course, many visits from

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.660
God reassuring Abraham of the promise, but it's not until chapter 21 where you

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.140
see the birth of Isaac. And you find that in verse number 1, the Bible says this of

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.700
Genesis 21,

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:53.780
As he said, aren't those precious words? Because God always does what he says he

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.860
will do. We may have to patiently endure, we may not get it exactly when we think

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.620
it's going to come, but we find that God always does what God says he will do.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.860
And the Bible says,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:14.060
As he had spoken. As he said, as he had spoken. It says in verse 2,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.380
For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.780
which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:29.620
unto him, whom Sarah bare to him Isaac. What a blessing! You come to chapter 22

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:36.100
and you find the instruction to take and to offer Isaac to the Lord. It says,

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.220
Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, in verse 2 of chapter 22, whom thou

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.340
lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.420
offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. We find that

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.700
Abraham obeyed. He went and God provided. Remember, it was Isaac that said, My

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:01.340
father, he said, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.420
And Abraham said, he said, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.740
offering. What great faith! We find that it's within the context of these

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.660
passages of Scripture that the example is used here in the book of Hebrews of

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.220
Abraham and how, yes, that promise had been given. Again, the Jewish believers, I

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.260
mean, as we understand the truth of the book of Genesis and we can relate to the

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.980
instruction that had been given to Abraham and how he patiently endured and

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.780
all of those things, no doubt these Jewish believers would easily be able to

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:43.220
relate to that which would be spoken to them here with regard to the example of

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.460
Abraham. It's important that we know as we interpret Scripture with Scripture and

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.020
Galatians chapter number three. I'm not planning to go back to the book of

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.660
Genesis, so you don't need to go there or keep your place there, but look over in

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.260
Galatians chapter number three, if you will, because I want to speak to you

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:04.060
about this promise of a seed. Yes, there's a promise of seed and land, but we find

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.860
that as we consider the example of Abraham here, as we make the transition

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:15.040
between using an example and then giving the believers some instruction, as we

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.920
find in the next several verses of Hebrews 6, we find that it's important

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.520
that we understand that we would be the ones that are referenced there in verse

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.720
17 of Hebrews 6, unto the heirs of promise. Notice in Galatians 3,

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.840
in verse number 6, even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.040
for righteousness, know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.000
are the children of Abraham. It says in verse number 8 in the Scripture, for

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.560
seeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:53.480
the gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:59.440
they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many, verse 10,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.000
as are of the works of the law are under the curse. For it is written, cursed is

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.080
every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.640
the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.680
It is evident, for the just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith, but

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.600
the man that doeth them shall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.920
curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.240
that hangeth on a tree. Notice that the blessing of Abraham might come on the

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.200
Gentiles, how? Through Jesus Christ. That we might receive the promise of the

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.160
Spirit through faith. Brethren, I speak after the manner of men, though it be

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.880
but a man's covenant. Yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:59.280
thereto. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promise made. He sayeth not, and to

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:10.080
seeds, as of many, but as of one. And to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.200
that the covenant that was confirmed before of God and Christ, the law, which

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.559
was 430 years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:23.480
promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:29.440
of promise, but God gave it to Abraham, how? By promise. And so as we come to

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.360
Hebrews chapter number 6 and we see, for when God made promise to Abraham, and we

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.920
think about the truth of that which is being given to us here, and he gives us

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.680
the truth of Genesis 22, the truth of Genesis 15, and then the truth of

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.559
Galatians 3, as we put all of these things together and we understand the

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:57.559
example here of this one Abraham, that God had made promise to him. That

00:19:57.559 --> 00:20:01.880
Abraham patiently endured, but then a

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.760
Abraham, as we find at the end of verse number 15, he obtained the promise.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.120
Of course, that son, Isaac, that was born, and of course, you follow the lineage, if

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.480
you will, and you see the seed being Christ.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.760
It's interesting to note, as you study throughout the Old Testament, so many evils that are

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.600
given against the nation of Israel, and so many battles and people groups that come against

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.760
them, you find that throughout the history, that really what's happening is Satan is working

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.040
to destroy the line that Messiah would come from.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.280
That's what you find.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.800
Why was it that Haman said, we're going to destroy all of the Jews?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.000
Satan is working.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.800
See, there is an evil that is taking place in our world, even still today, and we understand

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.640
that we are engaged in spiritual battle, spiritual warfare.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.800
Far too often, what happens is we look at some person as being the enemy, instead of

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.320
us understanding who the true enemy is.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.840
I'm speaking as a child of God this morning, and as a child of God, we must understand

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.600
when there's, listen, you understand the devil wants to destroy your home, but you understand

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.760
that your wife or your husband isn't your enemy.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.080
Satan is the enemy.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.720
He's the one that wants to destroy your home, and we could use illustration after illustration,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.840
example after example, but we find that as we would understand these things that had

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.520
happened in the Old Testament, and how they come to pass, and we come to verse 17 of Hebrews

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.520
6, and it says,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.840
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the, notice this, the heirs of promise,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.860
the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.840
The reality is that God didn't have to confirm anything by an oath.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:56.200
He did because it was human, it was part of the customs of humans to do that sort of thing.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.520
Have you ever had somebody say, do you promise?

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.040
You buy something, and you're going to sign something, you make this thing that you sign,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.279
and you've entered into an agreement, a contract, it's binding, and there's all sorts of legal

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:19.279
language that is used in it to show you what the responsibilities of the parties are, and

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:23.600
we find that God, listen, his word is enough.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:31.120
But in order to show the sureness of his promise, he took this step, as we find in

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.400
verse 16 and 17, notice, he says,

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.840
For men verily swear by the greater, but remember, there is no one greater than God.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:45.200
He could not appeal to a greater power, he is the greatest power, but in order to help

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:52.520
man understand, it says that an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, wherein God,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.840
appealing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise, notice this, the immutability

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.400
of his counsel confirmed it, how?

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400
By an oath.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.720
You read the end of Genesis chapter number 15, Abraham sleeping, when it passes through

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:15.040
the animals that have been set apart, and you see the reality of God making this promise,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.600
and he says in verse 18 that by two immutable things, that word immutable, unchanging, right?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.080
When we speak about the immutability of God, I'm so thankful that our God is the same yesterday

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.440
and today and forever.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.919
He said in Malachi, I am the Lord, I change not.

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:34.800
We can't say that, amen?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.400
We change sometimes multiple times in the same day, amen?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.279
I mean, sometimes we have good days, sometimes we have bad days, sometimes we have good moments

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:48.840
and we have bad moments, but God doesn't change, he is the same, and we find that it says that

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:56.080
by two immutable things, notice, in which it was impossible for God to lie.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.080
Paul mentioned this to Titus in Titus 1, you don't need to turn there, I'll read it to

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.480
you, but in verse number 2 it says, in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:10.440
promised before the world began.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.520
Our God cannot lie, he's not a man that he should lie, remember the situation in Numbers

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.600
between Balaam and Balak?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.000
And you understand our God, he is ever the same and he cannot lie.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.959
It says here that we might have a strong consolation, that word consolation, it means to comfort.

00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:37.660
In fact, it's the same word that's often used to refer to the Holy Spirit, the comforter.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:43.179
And what a joy to understand that he wants us to have this strong consolation, this comfort,

00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:48.980
because he's given us these promises and he's proven the surety of the promise.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:56.800
It says this, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.760
Now we find that he's speaking about the heirs of promise.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.700
We understand as we look at Galatians chapter number 3 that he's speaking about those that

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:10.059
are redeemed, those that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:13.899
And we find that it's interesting that in the passage of Scripture in Galatians chapter

00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:21.580
number 3, he's speaking of course to Gentiles and he makes it known here that the blessing

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.220
of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.980
Isn't that wonderful?

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.420
Salvation through Christ.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420
It's the only way.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.179
We sang about what a glory I'm saved, right?

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:36.300
Saved, saved, what a blessing.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.300
I'm saved how?

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.100
By the blood of the crucified one.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.220
It's the only way to be saved.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.700
I've often said, and I don't want to get into all that's going on in our nation today, but

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.059
there's great division that is going on.

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:54.140
And I've often said throughout the years of ministry as I study the Word of God and I

00:25:54.140 --> 00:26:00.140
understand the truth of God's Word, that the Word of God, that Jesus Christ, the Gospel

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.020
of Jesus Christ is the answer to man's problem.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.220
There's so many problems in our nation today, divisions that are man-made, by the way.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:14.300
And we find that those divisions that are man-made, we find that the Gospel is the healer.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.300
Why?

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:19.580
Because there's really only two categories of people, saved and lost.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.580
That's it.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.580
Amen?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.140
And we understand that as God has given us His Word and as He's speaking here, He's writing

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.779
to these believers and we take in context the entirety of this warning passage.

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:36.739
And He says, listen, I'm going to confront you on your spiritual immaturity.

00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:42.020
I'm going to challenge you to spiritual maturity that you would grow, that you would go on

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.020
to perfection.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.459
I'm going to share with you the evidences that ought to be in your life that would prove

00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:53.860
your salvation, that would prove your sanctification, and I want to encourage you to endure.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.459
See, the reality is that, as I mentioned at the very beginning of our study of the book

00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:04.739
of Hebrews, the book is written to people that are ready to go back to Judaism.

00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:06.380
They're looking to go back.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.459
Remember in John chapter number six when Jesus is speaking there and all of those disciples

00:27:11.459 --> 00:27:16.040
that had followed Him, they went away and Jesus says, are you going to go also?

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.660
And Peter stands up and says this, to whom shall we go?

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:27.300
He says that we know that thou art the Christ and that you have the words of eternal life.

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:31.940
And so we find that the writer of Hebrews is seeking to encourage these individuals.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.059
Listen, they have been given promises.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:36.980
We have been given promises.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:41.520
Standing on the promises, we sing the song, we rejoice in the promises of God.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.420
Can I tell you that for the child of God, we've not received every promise that's been

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.820
made to us.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.940
I'm not yet in heaven, amen?

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.059
This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through.

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:56.860
I have the promise that Christ is going to return.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.559
I have the promise that I will be with Him forever.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:05.420
But as we go through life, as these believers had received promise, He gives them the example

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.420
of Abraham.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.420
Why?

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.179
He received a promise but he didn't get it immediately.

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:11.179
He endured.

00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:13.020
And he endured how?

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.619
With patience.

00:28:14.619 --> 00:28:16.820
And then he obtained the promise.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:23.980
And so we find that he's reminding these believers on how they need to continue and to endure.

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:28.820
So we've seen, first of all, notice the example of Abraham, number 2, in verses 17-20.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.220
Notice the expectation of the redeemed.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.400
The word hope is used in this passage of Scripture.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.099
In verse 18, again in verse number 19, we see the word hope that is used and we understand

00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:50.059
biblically speaking that the word hope, it's an expectation based upon God's gracious promises.

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:52.780
Hope is confidence.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.979
It's an expectation.

00:28:54.979 --> 00:29:00.539
It's not like we so frequently use the word in our daily language today when we speak

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:03.500
about hoping for this or hoping for that.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.859
But we find that when we deal with biblical hope, it is an expectation that is based upon

00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:11.239
God's gracious promises.

00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:12.580
I have this hope.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.460
We speak about the blessed hope that Paul refers to in Titus.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.460
What is he speaking about?

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.539
The return of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:21.099
It is an expectation.

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:25.940
There is a confidence that we have as God's people that He is going to return.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.940
Why?

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.940
Because He said He would.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.500
And He's not slack concerning His promise.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.099
And what a blessing it is for us to understand that.

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:37.340
We find that He says, as I've mentioned already there in verse number 18, that we might have

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.580
strong consolation.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.900
And so we find that the recipients are given this word of comfort, of consolation, and

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.619
we find that they are given this promise and it's being explained to them that they could

00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:54.020
have an expectation.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.179
I'm so glad that this world is not all that there is for us.

00:29:58.179 --> 00:29:59.179
Amen?

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:00.940
There's so much more.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.340
And we find that the expectation is really illustrated in a few ways

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.860
here in the passage of Scripture.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.580
Notice at the end of verse number 18, it says this,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.780
we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.740
to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.620
I want to remind you this morning that God is our refuge.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.540
He's our refuge.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:31.580
In fact, the psalmist often cried out a verse that we dealt with,

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.220
really a psalm that we dealt with a couple of months ago

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.660
in one of our prayer meetings.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.140
In Psalm 46, in verse number 1,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:47.340
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.260
He continues in verse 2 and says,

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.380
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.100
and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.340
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.380
though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.660
Selah.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.580
See, God is our refuge.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.180
And we find this picture that is given,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.459
we'd be reminded of what the psalmist said,

00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:15.740
but we'd also understand of that which is in view here,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.100
really, we think about the cities of refuge.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.980
We haven't quite gotten there yet in our study of the book of Joshua,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.660
but as we get through the book of Joshua,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.819
you understand as the land is divided

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:28.380
and the tribes receive their inheritance,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.980
that there are cities of refuge.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.420
There were six of them,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.180
three on the eastern side of the Jordan,

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.940
three on the western side of Jordan,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.459
and they were strategically located

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:39.580
as God had instructed them to place those cities of refuge.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.819
It was interesting, if someone would kill somebody unawares,

00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:45.980
it was not a premeditated murder,

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.420
it was some type of an accident,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.540
they could flee to a city of refuge,

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.380
and as they would flee to the city of refuge,

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.580
they would have security within that city.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.260
The people of that city had a responsibility

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.660
to provide a refuge, a place of safety for them,

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.020
and you find there would be a hearing

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.459
and all sorts of things that would go on,

00:32:06.459 --> 00:32:07.980
if they were guilty, then they were guilty,

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.260
they'd be put to death if it was,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.300
in fact, a premeditated type of a thing.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.419
But we find that if it truly was an accident,

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:17.660
that they'd have to stay there until when?

00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:20.380
The death of the priest.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.220
And when the priest died, they could return back.

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:27.900
Now, it's interesting because God is our refuge,

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.619
the Lord Jesus Christ is our refuge,

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:33.020
and as we've often mentioned,

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.419
and we'll get into even more of this

00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:38.059
as we've spoken about the death of our Savior,

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:40.220
our high priest, but he rose again.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.580
He conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.419
We referenced in chapter number seven a few weeks ago

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:51.180
how that he has this unchangeable priesthood.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:51.660
Why?

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.660
Because he continueth ever.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.300
And we find here that God is our refuge,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.380
and what a joy to understand that.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.820
And the encouragement that's coming to these believers,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.979
he's saying, listen, there's an expectation

00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:08.860
that you ought to have as a redeemed person.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.500
And he speaks about God being our refuge.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.339
Number two, he speaks about the fact

00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:15.500
that he, God, is our anchor.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.220
Notice in verse 19,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.740
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.139
both sure and steadfast,

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:28.380
in which entereth into that within the veil.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.339
Isn't that precious?

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.020
We think about the fact that we have an anchor.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.940
We use that as our title.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.419
We've read the words of the songwriter

00:33:37.979 --> 00:33:40.460
that he shared in penning those words,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.500
no doubt inspired from this truth of Hebrews 6.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.940
In verse number 19,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.300
and we'd understand that this anchor that we have,

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.580
this anchor of the soul,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.580
that it's sure and steadfast,

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.100
but notice it says,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.419
which entereth into that within the veil.

00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:00.860
Remember, as we continue to use the example

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.740
of all that's taking place of the priesthood

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.860
and all of those things,

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.100
we find that in chapter number 14,

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.779
and excuse me, in chapter number four,

00:34:08.779 --> 00:34:10.940
in verse number 14 of the book of Hebrews,

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.460
that the writer says this,

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.419
seeing then that we have a great high priest

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:17.260
that is passed into the heavens,

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.980
Jesus, the son of God,

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.540
let us hold fast our profession.

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:25.500
For we have not an high priest

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.660
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.899
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:31.820
yet without sin.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.220
And we find that He, our Savior, our anchor,

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.980
the anchor of our soul,

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.500
that it's sure and steadfast,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.860
and that He is in heaven.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:42.380
Right?

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.820
It's interesting about the priest.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.380
The priest could go and make offering for the people,

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.860
but he could not lead the people

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.500
into the place where the offering would be made.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.820
We find that Jesus,

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.739
He entereth into that within the veil.

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:00.299
He is seated in the heavenlies.

00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:02.459
We understand that He's sitting upon His throne.

00:35:02.459 --> 00:35:05.019
We understand that the Bible teaches us

00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:07.019
in chapter number 10 of this same book,

00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:07.980
in verse number 12,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.019
but this man,

00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:11.820
after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.940
sat down on the right hand of God.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.140
He's our refuge.

00:35:18.779 --> 00:35:19.739
He's our anchor.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.459
He is our forerunner.

00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:23.739
Notice in verse number 20,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.700
the Bible says this,

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.980
whither the forerunner is for us entered,

00:35:30.619 --> 00:35:34.220
even Jesus, made an high priest forever

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.899
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:35:37.899 --> 00:35:39.820
As we think about the truth

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.899
that is given to us in verse number 20

00:35:41.899 --> 00:35:44.779
with regard to the usage of this word forerunner,

00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:46.059
it's an interesting word.

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:50.220
It means one who comes in advance to a place

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:53.260
where the rest are to follow.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.700
I like that.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.220
One who comes in advance to a place

00:35:59.739 --> 00:36:02.220
where the rest are to follow.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.179
Where's that place?

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.619
In heaven.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:05.899
It says,

00:36:05.899 --> 00:36:08.140
in which entereth into that within the veil

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.580
at the end of verse number 19,

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.700
whither the forerunner is for us entered,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.299
even Jesus, made an high priest forever

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.140
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.700
As we look at the passage of Scripture

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.100
and we conclude the warning section

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.059
that is given to these Jewish believers,

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.820
again, a group of people that

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.899
because of the intense persecution,

00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:31.820
because of all that they were dealing with,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.860
because of the time in which they were living

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.299
and the temple was still standing

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:38.140
and sacrifices were still being made

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.739
and they're dealing with all of those things

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:42.619
and they were dealing with this level of persecution,

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:44.299
there was a thought on the mind

00:36:44.299 --> 00:36:45.500
of some of these believers

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.500
that they would just return to Judaism.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.700
And we find that the writer of Hebrews says,

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.100
no, Jesus is superior.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.899
He begins that immediately in chapter number one

00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:58.220
and he deals with how Christ is superior

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.220
throughout those first several chapters.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.220
And in this particular warning,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.059
as he's giving the expectation to these redeemed,

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:08.700
he's saying, listen, you need to understand something.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.339
Let me remind you of Abraham.

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:14.619
Let me remind you how God made promise to Abraham,

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:17.019
but he didn't receive it immediately.

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:20.860
And in like manner, as you have received promise,

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:25.179
you can be assured of the promise that God has made.

00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:29.100
You can stand on the promises of God's Word.

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:29.660
Amen.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.739
We find that Peter said that they were exceeding

00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:35.660
great and precious promises.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.619
What a great truth that is given to us

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:41.660
with regard to that reference.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.220
I see Peter making that statement

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.500
and what a joy it is.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.299
We find that Paul said this in 2 Corinthians 1,

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.339
in verse number 20,

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:53.179
for all the promises of God in him are yea,

00:37:53.899 --> 00:37:59.179
and in him amen unto the glory of God by us.

00:37:59.899 --> 00:38:01.899
But you don't understand my circumstances.

00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:03.339
You don't understand what I'm dealing with

00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:05.100
and you don't know how hard it is.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.019
These people were dealing with some very hard times.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:10.779
What did the writer remind them of?

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:11.820
Remember the promises.

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:14.860
Remember there's an expectant end.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.140
This world is not all there is to offer.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.619
Sometimes we get so caught up in the problems

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:22.380
and the affairs of this world

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.619
and we get underneath of them

00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:26.619
and we get burdened down by them

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.980
and we get our eyes and our vision on those things.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.580
And Paul said in that book,

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.700
2 Corinthians chapter 4,

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.020
he says,

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.419
while we look not at the things which are temporal,

00:38:35.419 --> 00:38:37.659
and in verse number 18 of that fourth chapter,

00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:37.979
he says,

00:38:37.979 --> 00:38:39.900
but things which are eternal.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.700
Amen.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.419
And the reality is that these believers

00:38:43.419 --> 00:38:44.780
who had been struggling,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.700
who were dealing with difficulty,

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.059
we find that the expectation of these believers

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:51.419
is illustrated for them

00:38:51.419 --> 00:38:54.460
that we have that God is our refuge.

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:58.859
That we have an anchor that it's sure and steadfast

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.820
that He's our forerunner.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.780
That He's already gone to provide the way.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700
The forerunner would be used often

00:39:09.979 --> 00:39:11.099
in a number of different ways.

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:15.580
We use the military canvassing situation.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.580
He'd go before and if there were obstacles,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.979
if there were terrain difficulties,

00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:21.659
they would understand what was going on

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:24.539
and they would come back and provide direction

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:27.179
for how the rest of the group was to travel.

00:39:27.179 --> 00:39:29.099
And we find that as I've mentioned already,

00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:30.380
the Old Testament priest,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.179
he could not lead the people into the holy place,

00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:37.020
but we find that Jesus as our great high priest,

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.580
that He in fact has made the way.

00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:42.619
Remember what Jesus said in John 14,

00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:43.739
in verse number 6,

00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:48.859
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:53.500
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:56.059
I'm so thankful that He made a way,

00:39:56.059 --> 00:39:58.299
that He is the way.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.780
And these believers and...

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:06.340
they could easily relate to Abraham and they could understand the struggles. I

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:10.980
mean if you read from chapter 15 to chapter 21 and you read some of the

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.380
things that took place and you read about the laughter and you read about

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.380
the situation with Ishmael and you read about all of those things and you

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:24.460
understand what's taking place and as a Jewish believer you have this heritage

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:29.500
as being the seed of Abraham physically speaking they could relate and

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.980
understand Abraham received a promise but he didn't obtain a promise

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:41.140
immediately he endured with patience and now as us as believers we understand the

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.460
application from Galatians 3 that it's of that seed speaking spiritually

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:53.380
because it's through Christ and we are the heirs of promise we can rejoice this

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.140
morning in the promises of God I don't know what difficulty or challenge you're

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:03.780
dealing with but I do know that God's Word has the answer and I do know that

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:11.220
God he will provide us with the strength that we need he will give us the grace

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.900
remember what Paul said as he besought the Lord thrice in 2nd Corinthians

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.540
chapter number 12 for that infirmity that he dealt with that thorn in his

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:26.500
flesh and the Bible tells us that God replied and said no why because my grace

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:34.420
is sufficient for thee I wonder this morning as we deal with things even as

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:39.580
these believers in the first century that are receiving this book of Hebrews

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:47.300
I wonder if there are times in which we struggle with the thought of can we go

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:52.420
any further I mean look at all of these obstacles and these challenges I'm

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.980
dealing with can I remind you to turn to the promises of God can I remind you

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.020
this morning that we are to endure can I remind you this morning that his grace

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:07.060
is sufficient and I just wonder this morning in my life in your life have we

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:13.820
found it to be so have we found that his grace indeed is sufficient God is not a

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:19.500
liar he said that it would be sufficient and as we rest in him listen we sing the

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:25.380
song amazing grace oh what a great song his grace is abundant toward me Paul's

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:32.940
testimony and this morning let us be reminded we have an anchor it's

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:38.900
illustrated that way at the end in verse 19 of Hebrews 6 and these believers that

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.820
the writer is encouraging keep on go on to spiritual maturity don't give up

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:49.380
don't turn back go on for us this morning let us keep our eyes on Jesus

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:56.340
let us endure with patience let us understand that his promises are sure

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.620
father we love you this morning we thank you for loving us we thank you for thy

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.500
word the truth that's contained therein we thank you for the examples that you

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:12.340
given us in your word we thank you for how this passage of Scripture this

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:21.780
warning section for these believers how it concludes reminding these believers

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:30.100
of the promises that have been given to us we're so thankful that this mortal

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:37.420
shall put on immortality that this world is not our home we have the promise and

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.580
the certainty of heaven not because of our own righteousness but because of

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:46.260
redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ through the blood that was shed

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.820
through his death burial and glorious resurrection I pray this morning they

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.300
would help us to understand the expectation of the redeemed you'd help

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.380
us to understand that though we deal with trials and obstacles and challenges

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.740
in this world that this world is not my home help us to look on the eternal and

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:13.180
not the temporal help us to rest in the fact that you are the way the truth and

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:18.780
the life and that your grace indeed is sufficient if there's one that does not

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:22.740
know you as their personal Lord and Savior it's our prayer that today before

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:27.220
it's eternally too late they would trust Christ as their Savior for those that

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.940
have been saved by the blood of the crucified one Lord I pray you'd help us

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:37.940
to be encouraged this morning knowing that just as Abraham had received

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:44.460
promise that he endured with patience and then he obtained the promise God

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.820
would you help us to run a race we get to the twelfth chapter of this great

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:55.780
book we see that that's the instruction that is given race how with patience

00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:04.780
knowing as we look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith knowing that

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:10.220
we have this expectant end that forever and ever for all of eternity we will be

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.340
with thee and we'll worship thee and what a wonderful truth that is we pray

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:19.220
that you'd work in hearts and lives as only you can help us Lord today to be

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.140
encouraged well thank you for it in Christ's name we pray would you stand

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.420
