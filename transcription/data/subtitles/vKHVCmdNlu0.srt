1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,079
if you have your Bible with you, Psalm 139.

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:06,599
And after you find your place there at Psalm 139,

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:07,960
turn over to the book of Genesis

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,720
in the first chapter as well.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,960
Genesis chapter number one,

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,159
we'll be looking at portions

7
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,640
of both of these passages this morning.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And we'll look at some other portions of scripture as well.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
But these will be the main places

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,920
where we will find ourselves this morning.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,319
As you've noted, perhaps,

12
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,819
on the back of the bulletin this morning,

13
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:28,040
the title of the message is from Psalm 139

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,959
and verse number 14, a very familiar verse of scripture.

15
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,479
And the title of the message,

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,200
I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,520
And as we continue to recognize the greatness of God

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,599
as revealed through creation,

19
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:45,060
this morning we will address the creation of man.

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,919
I believe that the record of creation

21
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,959
that's found in Genesis chapter number one

22
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,759
reaches a climax on day number six,

23
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,740
when we read about God making man in his own image.

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,000
I've often referred to,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,479
and I believe it's an accurate reference

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,119
to refer to the creation of mankind

27
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,440
as mankind being God's most treasured creation.

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,040
And I'm so thankful that God provides us

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,639
with the record of the origin of man.

30
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,360
Of course, it's something that is often debated

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,519
and something that we find

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,680
many people have offered their opinions,

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,480
but I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,339
And his word is authoritative.

35
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:28,440
His word is trustworthy, for it is pure.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,279
And he was the one that was there in the beginning

37
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:32,680
and he gave us a record of what he did.

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,879
And we can rejoice in that.

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,639
We find that as we've mentioned in previous weeks,

40
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,279
as we've dealt with this subject of great is the Lord,

41
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:45,559
and really our endeavor in the beginning of 2023

42
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,800
is to recognize God's greatness.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,919
And we find that God's greatness

44
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,239
is revealed through creation.

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,720
And we've spent several weeks now on that subject

46
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:58,500
and seeing how God's greatness is revealed through creation.

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,019
And we've mentioned that God's great power,

48
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,900
he's omnipotent and his great power is revealed

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,779
as we study the truth of creation.

50
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,199
We also mentioned that his great wisdom,

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,820
that he is omniscient.

52
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,940
He has all power and he has all wisdom

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,259
and we can rejoice in those truths

54
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,039
and we see how great he is.

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,660
We then mentioned that creation reveals to us

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,339
that not only is our God omnipotent and omniscient,

57
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,240
but our God is a God of order.

58
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,759
And we can rejoice in that this morning

59
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,080
and understanding that he does all things well.

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
Next week we'll look at the truth

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,639
that all things are upheld by his own power

62
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,399
and what a blessing that is.

63
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,000
But God created Adam and Eve,

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,399
as I mentioned this truth of God being a God of order,

65
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:47,520
God created Adam and Eve with the ability to reproduce

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,000
and thus provided them with instruction

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,759
to be fruitful and multiply.

68
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,619
We find that the record of Genesis,

69
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,380
and I hope that as we look at both of these passages

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,539
this morning that it will make good sense to us

71
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,179
and we'll be encouraged and we'll be challenged

72
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,000
through what God has given us in his word.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,820
But the record in Genesis really provides us

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,559
with the record of the origin of man.

75
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,899
Where did man come from?

76
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,460
Well, God made man.

77
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,559
And we'll read that in just a few moments

78
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,139
in Genesis chapter number one.

79
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,279
And we find that that record in Genesis

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,779
provides us with the origin of man.

81
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:25,940
But then the record that we find here in Psalm 139,

82
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,779
I believe provides us with the wonder

83
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:32,339
of subsequent reproduction.

84
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,419
We find that God created man in his own image,

85
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,100
Adam and Eve in the garden.

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,300
And then we find that God gave them

87
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,860
the ability to reproduce.

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,080
And as we look here in Psalm 139,

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,380
we see the wonder of subsequent reproduction

90
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,000
that is mentioned to us and what a blessing it is

91
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,580
to understand that I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,460
Notice in Psalm 139 in verse number 13,

93
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,559
and we'll read down through verse number 18,

94
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,000
the Bible says this.

95
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,520
For thou hast possessed my reins.

96
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,979
Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

97
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,139
I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

98
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,760
Marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well.

99
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,420
My substance was not hid from thee

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,799
when I was made in secret and curiously wrought

101
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,000
in the lowest parts of the earth.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,359
Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect.

103
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,239
And in thy book, all my members were written,

104
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,679
which in continuance were fashioned

105
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,839
when as yet there was none of them.

106
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,679
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God.

107
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,760
How great is the sum of them.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
If I should count them,

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,399
they're more in number than the sand.

110
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,660
When I awake, I am still with thee.

111
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,019
As we know from our passage of scripture this morning,

112
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,940
and we'll look at Genesis one as well,

113
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,540
but I want you to notice with me, number one,

114
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,059
that we are made by God, we are made by God.

115
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,179
And I'm thankful that the testimony of the psalmist,

116
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,220
notice what he says, I will praise thee,

117
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,459
why in verse number 14,

118
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,779
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

119
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,459
And we find that he gives this individual perspective

120
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,239
when he says, I will praise thee

121
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,200
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

122
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,880
And no doubt this morning that each and every one of us

123
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,679
can have this same personal individual perspective

124
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,679
that we have been made, we have been designed,

125
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,920
uniquely designed by God.

126
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,720
And for that, we ought to rejoice

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,519
just as the psalmist says, I will praise thee

128
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,239
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

129
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,399
And we rejoice in that very truth.

130
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,519
We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 100

131
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,100
in verse number three, a great truth.

132
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,579
It says, know ye that the Lord, he is God.

133
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,959
It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.

134
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,959
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

135
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,339
It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.

136
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,579
Notice in Genesis chapter number one,

137
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,100
I asked you to hold your spot there,

138
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,519
but you come to the crowning point,

139
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,299
the climax, if you will, of creation.

140
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,440
On day number six, we read how that God

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,480
is going to create, it says in verse number 24,

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,559
God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature

143
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,500
after his kind, cattle and creeping thing

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,320
and beast of the earth after his kind.

145
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,000
And it was so.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,239
God made the beast of the earth after his kind

147
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,040
and cattle after their kind and everything

148
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,720
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind

149
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,679
and God saw that it was good.

150
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,760
But then I want you to notice in verse 26,

151
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,540
notice what the Bible says, and God said,

152
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,820
let us make man in our image.

153
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,019
After our likeness, let them have dominion

154
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,700
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air

155
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,660
and over the cattle and over all the earth

156
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,420
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

157
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,859
So God created man in his own image.

158
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,299
The image of God created he him,

159
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,559
male and female created he them.

160
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:14,000
As we know here in Genesis one in verses 26 and 27,

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,079
that God gives us the origin of man

162
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,320
and we find that we're made in the image of God.

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,920
We find here this morning that we're made

164
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,079
with body, soul and spirit.

165
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,119
We are eternal beings and we are capable

166
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,839
of communion and fellowship with God.

167
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,040
We're uniquely designed by God,

168
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,339
created in his image and it says after our likeness.

169
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,380
And think about that wonderful truth of how God made man.

170
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,899
We find that as we come to Genesis chapter number two

171
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,679
and there are people that try to take just issue

172
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,299
with the difference in Genesis one and Genesis two.

173
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:54,179
We find that Genesis one gives us a quick overview record

174
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,559
of how of what God created on which day.

175
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,920
Genesis chapter number two kind of brings that focus in

176
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,519
and tells us how he created man.

177
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,179
We find that if you were to think about maybe

178
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,940
the difference of a floodlight versus a spotlight.

179
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,179
I think it's a great analogy where Genesis one

180
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,859
is kind of this floodlight if you will

181
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,660
of here's what God did one through six days

182
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,859
and here's what he created and then the spotlight comes

183
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:21,779
in Genesis chapter number two when God speaks

184
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,179
about how he formed man.

185
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,420
Notice in verse number seven the Bible says

186
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,899
and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground

187
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:34,799
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life

188
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,159
and man became a living soul.

189
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,840
Isn't that awesome?

190
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,200
God tells us how he did it,

191
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,080
how he formed Adam there in verse number seven

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,440
and then we find that the record is given

193
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,719
with regard to the creation of Eve in verse number 18.

194
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,000
The Bible says that the Lord God said it is not good

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,599
that the man should be alone.

196
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,659
I will make him and help me for him

197
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,619
and praise the Lord for that amen

198
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:04,400
and I am thankful for my wife.

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,859
I am thankful for Holly and the Bible says

200
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,739
in verse number 19 out of the ground the Lord God

201
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,659
formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air

202
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,260
and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them

203
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,219
and whatsoever Adam called every living creature

204
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,059
that was the name thereof and Adam gave names

205
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,059
to all cattle verse 20 and to the fowl of the air

206
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,539
and to every beast of the field

207
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,900
but for Adam there was not a fowl and help me for him.

208
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,539
So notice it says that the Lord God caused a deep sleep

209
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,000
to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,320
and closed up the flesh instead thereof

211
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,039
and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man

212
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,960
made he a woman and brought her unto the man

213
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,080
and Adam said this is now bone of my bones

214
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,640
and flesh of my flesh.

215
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,059
She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man

216
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:52,119
and what a joy and what a blessing to see the record

217
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,359
of the origin of man and how God has given us

218
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,820
that record that we are made by God.

219
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,219
As we go back to Genesis chapter number, excuse.

220
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:03,899
to Psalm chapter 139, again, I've mentioned already

221
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,119
that there in Genesis 1, we really are provided

222
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:10,239
with the origin of man, but here in Psalms,

223
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,779
we are provided with the wonder of subsequent reproduction.

224
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,219
The end of chapter number two there,

225
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:18,519
we find that God tells them to be fruitful and multiply,

226
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,839
and we come to Psalm 139 and we read verses 13

227
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,219
and following, you begin to see the wonder

228
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,459
of subsequent reproduction and this truth

229
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,779
that we are made by God.

230
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,219
I was sharing with Brianna last night

231
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,299
as we're driving home from a basketball game,

232
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,459
we were talking about, she actually brought up to me

233
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,539
how she was working on a devotion

234
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,139
from this particular passage of scripture

235
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,819
and that she was working on developing and what have you,

236
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,259
and I said, that's funny, I'll be preaching.

237
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,559
Actually, she knew, Holly had mentioned to her

238
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,299
when she was talking to Holly about the devotion

239
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,739
that, hey, that's what daddy's preaching on on Sunday,

240
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,139
and I told her last night, I said, you know,

241
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,999
I dug in and studied this passage really in a deeper way

242
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,959
than I ever have before, and really,

243
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,159
we're just this past week just meditating

244
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,159
and meditating on this portion of scripture,

245
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,279
and it's so awesome how God made us

246
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,239
and how he knows us in the truth of that question

247
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:15,039
that people are so just debating today

248
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,999
of when does life begin?

249
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,559
God's word answers the question.

250
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,039
Notice with me, back in Psalm 139,

251
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,279
notice what the Bible says in verse number 13.

252
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,279
For thou hast possessed my reins.

253
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,479
You know that word reins is an interesting word.

254
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,079
You know what that word refers to?

255
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,679
It refers to our internal organs, the kidney.

256
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,279
When he talks about it in plural sense,

257
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,659
he's talking about all of those internal organs,

258
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,199
and you notice here that he says,

259
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:50,659
for thou hast possessed my reins.

260
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:52,419
Thou hast covered me, where?

261
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,379
In my mother's womb.

262
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,099
He will use, in verse number 15,

263
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,919
when he speaks about there in that verse of scripture

264
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,619
about where life is developed,

265
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,259
the subsequent reproduction,

266
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,739
he refers to it as the lower parts of the earth,

267
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,099
and we find that he's referring to that place,

268
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,699
and you notice here that as we see my reins,

269
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,679
that reference to the kidney, the internal organs,

270
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,619
you find in verse number 15 that he says,

271
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,379
my substance was not hid from thee.

272
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:26,379
That word substance means my bones or my skeletal structure.

273
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,379
He says my substance was not hid from thee

274
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,859
when I was made in secret and curiously wrought.

275
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,419
Notice that phrase in verse number 15.

276
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,739
This is a word that would often be used

277
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:42,539
in reference to someone that was working in needlework

278
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,499
or someone that was an embroiderer,

279
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,039
someone that was very skillful

280
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,859
with weaving things together and what have you,

281
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,879
and you begin to notice how he says

282
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,119
that we were curiously wrought

283
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,919
and how God really dealing with here

284
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,279
this skillful aspect of human life.

285
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,999
It's said, it's my understanding,

286
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,959
and I did some research to confirm this,

287
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,039
that the human body, if you were to take all of the veins

288
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,639
and all of that, that it's so long

289
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,359
that it could wrap around the earth twice

290
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,199
from one human being.

291
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,079
Your arteries and your veins.

292
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,179
That's amazing.

293
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,359
You see the, he says we're curiously wrought.

294
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:26,079
That word used of that one that would work in embroidery

295
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,439
and in needlework and the skill of those individuals.

296
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,279
Wow.

297
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,279
But then he says this in verse number 16.

298
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,279
Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect.

299
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,999
Now it's interesting, in our English translation,

300
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,999
we find the Bible says my substance yet being unperfect.

301
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,639
That's five words in English,

302
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,679
but you know that's just one Hebrew word.

303
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,319
One Hebrew word.

304
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,599
You know what that word means?

305
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:02,559
It's only used here in all of the Bible,

306
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,799
and it means embryo.

307
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:07,359
That's what it means.

308
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:12,759
We find here that David is giving testimony.

309
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,039
He says I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

310
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,559
We find that he says that my reigns are referenced

311
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,559
to the kidney, the internal organs, my substance,

312
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,679
my bones, my skeletal structure,

313
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,399
that I'm curiously wrought, the skill of God's handiwork,

314
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,519
that I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

315
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,799
My substance yet being unperfect, literally the embryo,

316
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,479
and we find all of this takes place,

317
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,599
according to verse 13 and verse number 15,

318
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,519
where?

319
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,679
In the mother's womb.

320
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,759
We see the origin of man in Genesis chapter number one.

321
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,319
When God formed man, God created man,

322
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,479
but we see the wonder of subsequent reproduction

323
00:14:55,479 --> 00:15:00,119
here in Psalm 139, and we find the testimony is given,

324
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,799
and we recognize with great clarity and great certainty

325
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,299
that we are made by God.

326
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,019
We can firmly and accurately declare

327
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,679
that life begins at conception.

328
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:17,719
Without apology.

329
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,759
He says in verse number 14, notice,

330
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,439
he says marvelous are thy works.

331
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,399
I've never gone to medical school.

332
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,679
I've done a little research,

333
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,199
and it is absolutely amazing when you study,

334
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,399
when you study the reproduction

335
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,779
in everything that has to take place

336
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,359
in order for life to come.

337
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,799
It's amazing, absolutely fascinating,

338
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,039
and we find that it is marvelous, wonderful, extraordinary.

339
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,519
It's what the word means, and this morning,

340
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,079
we find that David, as he's rejoicing here

341
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,079
and understanding, he says, listen,

342
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,159
I understand, first of all, that I'm made by God.

343
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,139
Notice this as we look here.

344
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,479
Not only are we made by God,

345
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,799
but I want you to notice, number two,

346
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,359
we are known by God.

347
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:19,579
We are known by God.

348
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,719
It's interesting, last week in Psalm 147,

349
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,119
we stood in amazement at understanding

350
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,799
that the Bible record in Genesis 1

351
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,919
simply says that he made the stars also,

352
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,859
and we gave estimate with regard

353
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,519
to how many stars there are in the universe

354
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,399
and all of that, and we said that it's interesting

355
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,699
in Psalm 147, and we stand in amazement

356
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,479
to know the truth that God, he knows their number,

357
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,659
and he calls them all by their names.

358
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,399
But you know, he didn't die for a star.

359
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,699
He died for you, and he died for me.

360
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,919
So if he knows the number of the stars

361
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,999
and he knows their name, and he calls them all

362
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,119
by their name, I'm so thankful this morning

363
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
to know that I'm known by God,

364
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,959
and you are known by God, and he knows everything

365
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,279
about us, and even though he knows everything

366
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,599
about us, you know what's amazing?

367
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,079
He still loves us.

368
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,639
He still loves us.

369
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,079
He knows everything about us.

370
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,199
Notice as the psalm begins in verses one through four

371
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,839
of Psalm 139, the psalmist says this,

372
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,459
O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me.

373
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,239
Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up-rising.

374
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,879
Notice what he says, thou understandest

375
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:48,119
my thought afar off.

376
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,119
Thou compassest my path and my lying down,

377
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,319
and art acquainted with all my ways,

378
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,879
for there's not a word in my tongue,

379
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:02,879
but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it all together.

380
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,599
We'll stop and just meditate on the truth

381
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,499
that we're known by God.

382
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,279
He knows us.

383
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,879
He knows our name.

384
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,439
He knows our thoughts.

385
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,079
He knows what we're dealing with.

386
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,119
He knows where you are right now in your life.

387
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,819
He knows everything about you.

388
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,019
It's interesting, as we understand this truth,

389
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,479
look over at the book of Matthew, if you will,

390
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,119
look at two verses of scripture.

391
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,239
In Matthew chapter number nine, I'll say this,

392
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,839
that he knows our thoughts.

393
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,000
Some of us have a hard time remembering our thoughts.

394
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,919
Amen?

395
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,919
The older we get, it seems like the easier

396
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,719
we forget our thoughts.

397
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,819
And someone said, I had a train of thought,

398
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,939
I just don't know where it derailed.

399
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:50,879
And the reality is that God knows our thoughts.

400
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,319
In Matthew nine, in verse number four,

401
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,539
notice what the Bible says.

402
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,799
Actually, I'll begin in verse number one.

403
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,799
It says, and he entered into a ship and passed over

404
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,279
and came into his own city.

405
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,459
And behold, they brought him to him,

406
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,519
a man sick of the palsy, laying on a bed.

407
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,959
And Jesus, seeing their faith,

408
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,139
sent him to the sick of the palsy.

409
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,719
Son, be of good cheer.

410
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,879
Thy sins be forgiven thee.

411
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,159
Behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,

412
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,519
this man blasphemeth.

413
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,359
Why would they take that perspective?

414
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,519
Well, they say, as it's recorded in another gospel,

415
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,759
that they said only God can forgive sins.

416
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,919
By the way, that's true.

417
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,959
But Jesus is God.

418
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:29,799
Thus, Jesus could say, thy sins are forgiven.

419
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,439
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four,

420
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:37,439
and Jesus, knowing their thoughts,

421
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,559
said, wherefore think ye evil in your heart?

422
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,759
Now, can you imagine how they must have responded

423
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,639
when they heard Jesus say,

424
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,159
why are you thinking what you're thinking?

425
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,879
They'd not yet made it public.

426
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:51,159
They'd not verbalized their thoughts,

427
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,219
but Jesus knew what they were thinking.

428
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,119
He knows our thoughts.

429
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:57,959
He knows our thoughts.

430
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,479
I remember teaching a...

431
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,719
passage of scripture, I think it was this one,

432
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,079
it might have been the account in Mark,

433
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,599
was teaching this in vacation Bible school

434
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,879
probably back in 2012.

435
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,159
A little boy sitting in my class

436
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,479
as I was teaching that class and we were downstairs,

437
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:13,839
actually in the classroom now where

438
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,159
the nursery, nursing room is,

439
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,719
that was a classroom back then,

440
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,719
there wasn't a door there to join the two rooms.

441
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,719
And I was sitting there and I was teaching

442
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,319
and I talked about how God knows our thoughts.

443
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,519
There's a little boy sitting in our class

444
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,759
about nine years old, eight years old,

445
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,319
and it just absolutely blew his mind.

446
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,639
I mean, he sat in absolute awe of

447
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,879
God knows what I'm thinking.

448
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,919
Yeah, he does.

449
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,279
He knows our thoughts.

450
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,139
He knows everything about us.

451
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,239
I want you to think about this.

452
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,559
I said we look at two verses here

453
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,559
from Matthew, turn to chapter number 10.

454
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,599
The Bible tells us that he knows

455
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,319
the very hairs on our head.

456
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,199
And you want to talk about getting detailed.

457
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,079
You want to talk about how well he knows us.

458
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,999
The Bible says in Matthew 10 in verse number 30,

459
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,999
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

460
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,139
That's fascinating.

461
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,839
See, we could only estimate last week

462
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
when we looked at the stars,

463
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,759
we could only estimate their number.

464
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,919
We do not know for certainty or accuracy

465
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,759
the number of stars.

466
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,159
We estimate based on what science tells us

467
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,319
as to what they have been able to project

468
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,279
the number of stars to be,

469
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,119
but we say that God knows their number

470
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,039
and he calls them all by their name.

471
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,599
But then when we begin to think about us

472
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,479
as individuals and how much he knows us,

473
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,279
remember, we're made by him,

474
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,619
but we're known by him.

475
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:46,079
He knows the very number of the hairs on your head.

476
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,039
I've often said as I've looked at that passage,

477
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,999
he's got to do subtraction for me.

478
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:54,519
And for some, he's doing addition and multiplication,

479
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,039
but someone reminded me recently

480
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,759
of how little hair I have.

481
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,359
In fact, it was the guy moving the chairlift

482
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,359
and I said, listen, man, I'm not gonna help you

483
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,479
if you're gonna keep picking on me, you know?

484
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,919
But the reality is that God knows the number

485
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,959
and he doesn't just know about the number.

486
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,479
He knows the number.

487
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,079
Think about that.

488
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,779
There's like eight billion people in the world today.

489
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,079
It's okay.

490
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,259
Our God is great.

491
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,339
He's got all knowledge, all wisdom, all power,

492
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:32,339
and he knows the very number of the hairs on our heads.

493
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,019
We're known by God.

494
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,019
We're made by God.

495
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,619
We're known by God.

496
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,239
And then let me say this.

497
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,079
We are valued by God.

498
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,739
We are valued by God.

499
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:50,059
Notice what the Bible says back in Psalm 139.

500
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:52,099
I want you to look at verses 17 and 18.

501
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,619
I want you to consider with me this morning

502
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:00,139
that life is a precious gift from Almighty God.

503
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:05,279
We thank God for the life that he gives,

504
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,939
but we can rejoice in knowing

505
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:10,259
that though we have this physical life

506
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,179
that he valued us so much that he died

507
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:16,399
so that we might have eternal life.

508
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,639
The gift of God is eternal life

509
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,979
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

510
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:24,079
And how we ought to rejoice this morning

511
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,119
in understanding that we are valued by God.

512
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,039
Notice what the Bible says in verse 17.

513
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,439
After the psalmist in verses 13 through 16

514
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,879
is rejoicing in understanding that we're made by God

515
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,119
and the wonder of this subsequent reproduction

516
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,099
and how God knows us and all that he does

517
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,119
and how he fashions and so on and so forth.

518
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,559
And he says in verse 17,

519
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,559
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me,

520
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,719
O God, how great is the sum of them.

521
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,519
If I should count them,

522
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,239
they are more in number than the sand.

523
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,599
When I awake, I am still with thee.

524
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,839
What did you think about last week?

525
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,479
We talked about the stars and the number of them.

526
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,319
Now you look at the number of the sand.

527
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,679
He says, if I should count them,

528
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,759
they are more in number than the sand.

529
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,119
You ever try to count sand?

530
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,359
Why would you try?

531
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,559
You must be outside of your mind, right?

532
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,719
I mean, you wanna talk about somebody being bored?

533
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,559
That takes it to a whole new level.

534
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,759
I think I'm gonna go over here and count sand.

535
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,079
Really?

536
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,599
I don't think anyone's ever said that.

537
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,119
I said I don't think anyone's ever said that, all right?

538
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,159
Because it doesn't make sense in my mind.

539
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,719
But the psalmist says,

540
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:48,719
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God,

541
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,999
how great is the sum of them.

542
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:56,399
If I should count them,

543
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,959
they are more in number than the sand.

544
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,079
When I awake, I am still with thee.

545
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:08,079
You know, I'm so thankful that we're valued by God.

546
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,079
See, God made us, God knows us,

547
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,199
and we are valued by God.

548
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,839
Begin to think about this truth this morning

549
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,599
in looking what the psalmist says

550
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,999
and understanding how God knows us

551
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:28,199
and how God has us on his mind.

552
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,919
And we've often mentioned about the example

553
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,559
of the Apostle Paul praying for the believers in Philippi

554
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,199
and looking at that truth.

555
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,559
And Philippians one of how he refers to them

556
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,599
and how he's talking about praying for them.

557
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,919
And we've often, as we've looked at that passage

558
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,159
of scripture, we've said, why is Paul saying,

559
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,159
I thank God upon every remembrance of you?

560
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:50,719
Why is he thinking about them?

561
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,839
He says, because I have you in my heart in verse number seven

562
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,199
and the thoughts that he has of them,

563
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,919
the people in Philippi, those believers

564
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,919
are because he has them in his heart.

565
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,379
And I rejoice in understanding this morning

566
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:07,119
that God loves me with an unconditional love

567
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,799
with an everlasting love.

568
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,119
And he's thinking, he has thoughts about us

569
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,919
and his thoughts are precious

570
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,479
according to what the psalmist says.

571
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:17,199
And we this morning begin to understand

572
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:20,059
that my life is valued by God.

573
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,959
What a blessing.

574
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,539
You understand this morning that every life

575
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,079
is valued by God and we understand that biblically

576
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,539
for really two basic reasons.

577
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,699
Number one, we're made by God.

578
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:39,499
If we're not made by God,

579
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:42,699
the value of life decreases exponentially.

580
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,599
If Darwinian evolution is true,

581
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,739
then life really has no value.

582
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:54,139
And you understand that the perpetuity of that teaching

583
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:58,099
and the seeking to influence a generation of people

584
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,979
that do not value life, why?

585
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,059
Because life is just some random chance

586
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,659
and it's the survival of the fittest

587
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,619
and so on and so forth.

588
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,659
And if Darwinian evolution is true,

589
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,659
then life really has no value.

590
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,299
But God made man.

591
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,819
We're made by God.

592
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:18,139
We're valued by God.

593
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:23,539
And I am so thankful this morning that life has value

594
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,539
because life is the direct result of God's handiwork.

595
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:32,959
And God made man and man has value

596
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,439
because we've been made by God.

597
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,319
We've been made in the image and the likeness of God.

598
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,999
We're eternal with body, soul, and spirit

599
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,279
and the opportunity, the ability to be able

600
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,719
to commune with God and have fellowship with God.

601
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:49,479
Wow, it's absolutely amazing.

602
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,479
It's no wonder today

603
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,399
that it seems as if we continue to read

604
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,039
of tragic loss of life.

605
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,159
Perhaps you saw on your phone this morning,

606
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,279
just as I did, of another mass shooting

607
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:10,439
that took place overnight in California.

608
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,919
And we continue to see this in our society

609
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,719
and around our globe, but we continue to teach

610
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,699
that life really has no value.

611
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,239
No wonder they behave the way that they do.

612
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,959
But this morning, as the people of God,

613
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,199
we understand that we are valued by God,

614
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:35,760
that God loves us, that God thinks about us,

615
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,639
that we are valued by God, why?

616
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,519
Because we're made by him.

617
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,599
We have great value because we're made in the image of God.

618
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,079
We're to have dominion, if you read the text with me

619
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,959
in Genesis chapter one, over all of the other creation.

620
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,639
That's what God's design is.

621
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,880
We live in a time in which there are many

622
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,880
that value the creation more than the creator, right?

623
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:06,719
The creature more than the creator,

624
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:10,159
and they value the creature more than human life.

625
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:14,000
It's amazing.

626
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,399
It's Romans one being worked out, it really is.

627
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:26,339
And we find this morning that we're made by God,

628
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,659
that we're known by God, that we're valued by God.

629
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,299
I said for two reasons, number one,

630
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,899
that we're made in the image of God,

631
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,599
but think about this, number two,

632
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:40,619
that Jesus Christ, who is God, died for mankind.

633
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:47,260
You know how much value that places on your life,

634
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,260
on the life of man, that God robed in human flesh,

635
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:57,739
went to the cross of Calvary, shed His precious blood

636
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,299
so that you could be redeemed.

637
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:05,939
so that I could be redeemed. Does that not show great value? Does that not show worth?

638
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:12,019
We begin to think about the value of things when we talk about different things in our world today.

639
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,659
We're going to talk about the value of something and what someone would be willing to pay.

640
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:20,979
Oftentimes, you'd hear somebody say, well, this is worth x. Well, it's really only worth that

641
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:27,219
if someone's willing to pay that. Right? Would you agree? And so we find that today,

642
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:34,739
we begin to think about, well, what was paid for me? God died for me. The Lord Jesus Christ

643
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:40,179
came to this sin-cursed world. He lived a perfect and sinless life, and he went to a cruel cross,

644
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:47,939
and he bled, and he suffered, and he died for me, for you. What value

645
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:59,859
he placed upon his creation, upon mankind. Wow. This morning,

646
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:09,859
I stand in awe of thinking about human life, the gift of life. But I stand in awe

647
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,499
and understand the value that God has placed on each and every one of us,

648
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:19,779
being willing to die for us. Look at the verse. It's a familiar verse, John 3,

649
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:26,339
in verse number 16. It's a verse that many could quote, no doubt.

650
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:40,259
But in John 3, in verse number 16, the Bible says this,

651
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:49,139
for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.

652
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:56,099
We sang it this morning, whosoever will. It says here that whosoever believeth in him

653
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:04,259
should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn

654
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:13,859
the world, but that the world through him might be saved. Why? Because he valued.

655
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:19,619
Listen, you understand that Jesus was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world.

656
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:26,899
In eternity past, if we look at it from that perspective, from our human perspective,

657
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:34,899
God designed a plan for you and I, for mankind to be redeemed. Yes, for us to be created,

658
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:40,659
but he knew that we'd fall because he knows all things. And he knew that man would need to be

659
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:53,299
redeemed. And the plan of redemption was developed by God. God would take on human flesh and die.

660
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,539
He would rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave. It says in John 3, in verse 36,

661
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,779
he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. And he that believeth not the Son shall

662
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:12,019
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. I'm so thankful this morning that God loved me

663
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:19,699
and God valued me. I'm thankful that he made me. I'm thankful that he knows me. I'm thankful that

664
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:27,059
he valued me. You know, in Romans chapter number 5, we mentioned Romans 10 earlier this morning

665
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,379
after we sang that song, Whosoever Will, but I want you to notice over in Romans chapter number

666
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:38,099
5, if you will, the Bible gives us great truth in this passage. We can't read all 21 verses

667
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:45,299
with regard to the sin of mankind and the sin entering into the world of Adam and all that

668
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,699
takes place, but I just want to look at a couple of verses here in Romans 5. Notice in verse number

669
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:59,299
1, the Bible says this, therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord

670
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:05,219
Jesus Christ. Think about that truth of justification. He says that we're justified,

671
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:12,899
how? By faith, not by works. We're justified by faith. And we understand this morning that

672
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,979
that work of justification, it's recognizing that Jesus Christ is God and he died on a cruel cross

673
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:25,779
and he was sinless and he was perfect and the just for the unjust and he went to that cruel cross

674
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:30,899
and he bled and he died and he suffered and he was buried but he rose again and we're justified

675
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:39,539
by faith. And then he says this, we have peace with God. How? Through our Lord Jesus Christ.

676
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:45,699
Because the reality is that before we placed our faith, before we were justified by faith,

677
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:52,659
we were at enmity with God. There was no peace between me and God, there was enmity between me

678
00:34:52,659 --> 00:35:01,619
and God. I needed to be redeemed, I needed to be reconciled. Why? Because my sin, your sin,

679
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:12,819
is a barrier between us and God. And it has to be dealt with. And I can't resolve my own sin.

680
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:20,579
You can't resolve your own sin. I can't resolve your sin for you. And you can't resolve my sin

681
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:30,899
for me. Only Jesus. Only Jesus. And that's why he says, listen, we were at enmity, but he says

682
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:36,899
we have now, we have peace with God. Why? Because we've been justified by faith, so we've trusted

683
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:41,379
the Lord Jesus Christ, our personal Savior. It's not by works of righteousness which we have done,

684
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:45,779
but according to his mercy he hath begotten us. For by grace are you saved through faith and that

685
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:53,059
not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And we find

686
00:35:53,059 --> 00:36:02,659
that we're justified and we have peace through the Lord Jesus Christ. There's no way to have

687
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:13,059
peace with God apart from Jesus. It's impossible. But this morning, we rejoice in knowing that we

688
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:23,059
can have peace with God because of Jesus. Glory, hallelujah. He valued us. He died for us. It says

689
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:29,699
in Romans 5 and verse 3, but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners,

690
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,699
Christ died for us. We're his enemies.

691
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:45,059
But he died for us. Why? Because he loves us, because we're valued by God. And this morning,

692
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:52,179
I hope that as we look at this passage in Psalm 139, a familiar passage of Scripture,

693
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:58,099
we often read the words of verse number 14, I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

694
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:03,940
I am fearfully and wonderfully made. We hear it often, and it's good.

695
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:13,699
But when we really dig into the passage, I hope this morning that we recognize we're made by God.

696
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:22,739
We're not made of ourselves. God gives us the record of the origin of man in Genesis 1,

697
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:33,539
how He formed Adam from the dust, and then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

698
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:41,619
Reminds me of one of our missionaries over in Senegal, the Medes. You know, in America,

699
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:46,579
so often we say, we love you with all my heart. Right? You ever use that expression?

700
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:51,459
You know what they say in Senegal? I love you with all my nose.

701
00:37:53,699 --> 00:38:00,419
You say, what? Yeah, Medes' nose. You know why they say that? Because they believe the record

702
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:07,379
of Genesis 1, that God breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life. And so, the greatest

703
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:12,339
way they could express in their culture and their understanding how loving someone

704
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:16,819
is, is to say, I love you with all of my heart. And so, in Genesis 1,

705
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:24,659
with all of their nose, not heart, because that's where the life came from. It's pretty interesting,

706
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:34,419
pretty fascinating. We read of God giving the record of the origin, but then He said,

707
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:40,339
be fruitful and multiply. And so, in creating Adam and then using a rib and causing that deep sleep

708
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:46,339
He then tells the first created human beings, Adam and Eve, He says, be fruitful and multiply.

709
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:52,820
And so, in creating them, the God of all power and all wisdom, He gave them,

710
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:00,820
because He's a God of order, the ability to reproduce. And the record of Psalm 139 gives us

711
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,260
the wonder of subsequent reproduction. How does it work? And we read in the text of Scripture

712
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:14,739
that we're made by God. God knows the internal organs, the skeletal structure, the embryo.

713
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:27,859
When does life begin? At conception, in the womb. Why do we value life? Because God values life.

714
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:35,380
Because life, man, is made in the image of Almighty God.

715
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,739
And because we're made in the image of God, there's value.

716
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:50,979
And then God died for man. Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. Oh, how thankful we ought to be.

717
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:59,219
For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might

718
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:09,039
be made the righteousness of God in him. It's like Corinthians 5 and verse 21. This morning,

719
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:18,639
I hope that we rejoice in knowing the truth that we're made by God, that we're known by

720
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:27,039
God, and that we are valued by God. I hope this morning that as we understand those truths,

721
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:33,619
that we would take and understand that the truth of redemption is so closely related

722
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:38,259
to what we're dealing with this morning and how we ought to recognize the need to be redeemed.

723
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:42,119
If you've not trusted Christ as your Savior this morning, understand that God loves you

724
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,579
and he values you and he died for you so that you could be redeemed, so that you could have

725
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:54,179
your sins forgiven, so that you could know that heaven is your home. We live in a world

726
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:06,959
today that's debating so many of these things. The origin of man, when does life begin? These

727
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:15,659
things are being debated. They're debated regularly. And many of our young people are

728
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:19,339
being given an answer different than what I proclaimed this morning from this pulpit

729
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:30,239
from this book. We cannot have our head in the sand. We must recognize this morning that

730
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:39,599
life does have value. And we must, as I mentioned that we're made by God, we can accurately

731
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,679
and firmly declare that life begins at conception. We're not to be ashamed of that. We fight

732
00:41:46,699 --> 00:42:01,139
for that. There's a stain on America, on the world, with the shedding of innocent blood.

733
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:09,739
We find this morning that we must proclaim to a group of people, a young generation that's

734
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:15,659
rising up that does not understand that life has value because they've been taught Darwinian

735
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:25,919
evolution. They've been taught that there is no God. They deny that Jesus died to save

736
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:36,639
anybody. But we look at the truth of the Word that God has given us and we say, thank God

737
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:44,999
for the plan of redemption. Thank God for the value of life. I'll say this in closing,

738
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:51,419
just so you understand, I'm not, I haven't lost my mind this morning. I listened to an

739
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:56,659
excerpt. It was a lengthy excerpt. It wasn't just a, you know, five-second sound bite.

740
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:05,099
It was a lengthy excerpt from a man teaching at the Arizona State University, professor.

741
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:14,979
He was teaching, large class that he was teaching, and he said this in his classroom. He said,

742
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:23,839
this idea that Jesus died for you is ridiculous. And then he went on to say this because he

743
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,479
was teaching this idea of evolution. He said that a star had to die for you so that you

744
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:40,679
could have life. That's what he said. That's what's being taught in our education system.

745
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:48,019
That's what's being taught. I'm so thankful that Jesus died for me. I'm so thankful that

746
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:55,779
I was, I am, and you are fearfully and wonderfully made. What did the psalmist say? I will praise

747
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:01,899
thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. He knows me. He knows everything about me,

748
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:09,439
but he still loves me. He still loves me. If you're saved this morning, what a great,

749
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:21,879
great privilege that we have to tell someone else God loves you. He loves you. He values you. He

750
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:28,519
made you, and he died for you because he loves you so much. This morning I am fearfully and

751
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:35,699
wonderfully made. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. How we

752
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:40,419
thank you for the record that you've given us as we've looked at these two portions of Scripture

753
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:49,699
this morning and see the origin of man, the wonder of subsequent reproduction. And Lord,

754
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:56,899
I pray you'd help each and every one of us to rejoice in the truth that we are made by you.

755
00:44:56,899 --> 00:45:07,199
We are known by you, and we are valued by you. Lord, I pray this morning that if there's one

756
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,599
that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, whether they're here locally or

757
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:22,319
they're tuned in via live stream, they do not have assurance of heaven, I pray this morning that today

758
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:31,579
would be the day of their salvation. That they would recognize, God, you love them, that you died

759
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:40,579
for them. They would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. I pray

760
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:46,819
for every child of God, each one that's here this morning that's been saved. We've been justified,

761
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:53,639
we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to

762
00:45:53,639 --> 00:46:02,199
rejoice and praise you as the psalmist said. I pray that you'd help us to proclaim this message

763
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:18,139
far and wide. We're seeing an attack. God, we must stand up for righteousness, for the truth

764
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:26,739
of your word. And I pray this morning that you'd give us boldness, give us power. I pray, Lord,

765
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:37,119
that you'd help us to be good representatives and witnesses of you. I pray that in these moments

766
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,759
of invitation that you'd move and work as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for

767
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:45,599
every decision that's made. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand?
