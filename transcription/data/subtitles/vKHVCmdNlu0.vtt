00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
if you have your Bible with you, Psalm 139.

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:06.599
And after you find your place there at Psalm 139,

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:07.960
turn over to the book of Genesis

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.720
in the first chapter as well.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.960
Genesis chapter number one,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.159
we'll be looking at portions

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.640
of both of these passages this morning.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.920
And we'll look at some other portions of scripture as well.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.200
But these will be the main places

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.920
where we will find ourselves this morning.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.319
As you've noted, perhaps,

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.819
on the back of the bulletin this morning,

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.040
the title of the message is from Psalm 139

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.959
and verse number 14, a very familiar verse of scripture.

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:32.479
And the title of the message,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.200
I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.520
And as we continue to recognize the greatness of God

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.599
as revealed through creation,

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:45.060
this morning we will address the creation of man.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.919
I believe that the record of creation

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:48.959
that's found in Genesis chapter number one

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:51.759
reaches a climax on day number six,

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.740
when we read about God making man in his own image.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.000
I've often referred to,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479
and I believe it's an accurate reference

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.119
to refer to the creation of mankind

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.440
as mankind being God's most treasured creation.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.040
And I'm so thankful that God provides us

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.639
with the record of the origin of man.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.360
Of course, it's something that is often debated

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.519
and something that we find

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.680
many people have offered their opinions,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.480
but I'm thankful that God has given us his word.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.339
And his word is authoritative.

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.440
His word is trustworthy, for it is pure.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.279
And he was the one that was there in the beginning

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:32.680
and he gave us a record of what he did.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.879
And we can rejoice in that.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.639
We find that as we've mentioned in previous weeks,

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.279
as we've dealt with this subject of great is the Lord,

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.559
and really our endeavor in the beginning of 2023

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:47.800
is to recognize God's greatness.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.919
And we find that God's greatness

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:51.239
is revealed through creation.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.720
And we've spent several weeks now on that subject

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.500
and seeing how God's greatness is revealed through creation.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.019
And we've mentioned that God's great power,

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:04.900
he's omnipotent and his great power is revealed

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.779
as we study the truth of creation.

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.199
We also mentioned that his great wisdom,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.820
that he is omniscient.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.940
He has all power and he has all wisdom

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.259
and we can rejoice in those truths

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.039
and we see how great he is.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.660
We then mentioned that creation reveals to us

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.339
that not only is our God omnipotent and omniscient,

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.240
but our God is a God of order.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.759
And we can rejoice in that this morning

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.080
and understanding that he does all things well.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.360
Next week we'll look at the truth

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.639
that all things are upheld by his own power

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.399
and what a blessing that is.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.000
But God created Adam and Eve,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.399
as I mentioned this truth of God being a God of order,

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.520
God created Adam and Eve with the ability to reproduce

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.000
and thus provided them with instruction

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.759
to be fruitful and multiply.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.619
We find that the record of Genesis,

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.380
and I hope that as we look at both of these passages

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.539
this morning that it will make good sense to us

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.179
and we'll be encouraged and we'll be challenged

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.000
through what God has given us in his word.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.820
But the record in Genesis really provides us

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.559
with the record of the origin of man.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.899
Where did man come from?

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.460
Well, God made man.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.559
And we'll read that in just a few moments

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.139
in Genesis chapter number one.

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.279
And we find that that record in Genesis

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.779
provides us with the origin of man.

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.940
But then the record that we find here in Psalm 139,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.779
I believe provides us with the wonder

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.339
of subsequent reproduction.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.419
We find that God created man in his own image,

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.100
Adam and Eve in the garden.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.300
And then we find that God gave them

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.860
the ability to reproduce.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.080
And as we look here in Psalm 139,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.380
we see the wonder of subsequent reproduction

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.000
that is mentioned to us and what a blessing it is

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.580
to understand that I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.460
Notice in Psalm 139 in verse number 13,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.559
and we'll read down through verse number 18,

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.000
the Bible says this.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.520
For thou hast possessed my reins.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.979
Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.139
I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.760
Marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.420
My substance was not hid from thee

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.799
when I was made in secret and curiously wrought

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:25.000
in the lowest parts of the earth.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.359
Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect.

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:32.239
And in thy book, all my members were written,

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:34.679
which in continuance were fashioned

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:36.839
when as yet there was none of them.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.679
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:43.760
How great is the sum of them.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.440
If I should count them,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.399
they're more in number than the sand.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.660
When I awake, I am still with thee.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.019
As we know from our passage of scripture this morning,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:55.940
and we'll look at Genesis one as well,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.540
but I want you to notice with me, number one,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.059
that we are made by God, we are made by God.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.179
And I'm thankful that the testimony of the psalmist,

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.220
notice what he says, I will praise thee,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.459
why in verse number 14,

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:10.779
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.459
And we find that he gives this individual perspective

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.239
when he says, I will praise thee

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:20.200
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.880
And no doubt this morning that each and every one of us

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.679
can have this same personal individual perspective

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.679
that we have been made, we have been designed,

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.920
uniquely designed by God.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.720
And for that, we ought to rejoice

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.519
just as the psalmist says, I will praise thee

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.239
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:41.399
And we rejoice in that very truth.

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.519
We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 100

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.100
in verse number three, a great truth.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.579
It says, know ye that the Lord, he is God.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:53.959
It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.959
We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.339
It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves.

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.579
Notice in Genesis chapter number one,

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:06.100
I asked you to hold your spot there,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.519
but you come to the crowning point,

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.299
the climax, if you will, of creation.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.440
On day number six, we read how that God

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.480
is going to create, it says in verse number 24,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.559
God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.500
after his kind, cattle and creeping thing

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.320
and beast of the earth after his kind.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.000
And it was so.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.239
God made the beast of the earth after his kind

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.040
and cattle after their kind and everything

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.720
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.679
and God saw that it was good.

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.760
But then I want you to notice in verse 26,

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.540
notice what the Bible says, and God said,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.820
let us make man in our image.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.019
After our likeness, let them have dominion

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:53.700
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.660
and over the cattle and over all the earth

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.420
and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.859
So God created man in his own image.

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:05.299
The image of God created he him,

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:09.559
male and female created he them.

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:14.000
As we know here in Genesis one in verses 26 and 27,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.079
that God gives us the origin of man

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:18.320
and we find that we're made in the image of God.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.920
We find here this morning that we're made

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.079
with body, soul and spirit.

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:28.119
We are eternal beings and we are capable

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.839
of communion and fellowship with God.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:34.040
We're uniquely designed by God,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.339
created in his image and it says after our likeness.

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:42.380
And think about that wonderful truth of how God made man.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.899
We find that as we come to Genesis chapter number two

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:48.679
and there are people that try to take just issue

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:51.299
with the difference in Genesis one and Genesis two.

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:54.179
We find that Genesis one gives us a quick overview record

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:57.559
of how of what God created on which day.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.920
Genesis chapter number two kind of brings that focus in

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.519
and tells us how he created man.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:06.179
We find that if you were to think about maybe

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:08.940
the difference of a floodlight versus a spotlight.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.179
I think it's a great analogy where Genesis one

00:08:11.179 --> 00:08:12.859
is kind of this floodlight if you will

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:15.660
of here's what God did one through six days

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.859
and here's what he created and then the spotlight comes

00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:21.779
in Genesis chapter number two when God speaks

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:23.179
about how he formed man.

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.420
Notice in verse number seven the Bible says

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.899
and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:34.799
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.159
and man became a living soul.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.840
Isn't that awesome?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.200
God tells us how he did it,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.080
how he formed Adam there in verse number seven

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.440
and then we find that the record is given

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.719
with regard to the creation of Eve in verse number 18.

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:55.000
The Bible says that the Lord God said it is not good

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.599
that the man should be alone.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.659
I will make him and help me for him

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.619
and praise the Lord for that amen

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:04.400
and I am thankful for my wife.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.859
I am thankful for Holly and the Bible says

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.739
in verse number 19 out of the ground the Lord God

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:10.659
formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:13.260
and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.219
and whatsoever Adam called every living creature

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:17.059
that was the name thereof and Adam gave names

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:19.059
to all cattle verse 20 and to the fowl of the air

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.539
and to every beast of the field

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.900
but for Adam there was not a fowl and help me for him.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.539
So notice it says that the Lord God caused a deep sleep

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.000
to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.320
and closed up the flesh instead thereof

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.039
and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:40.960
made he a woman and brought her unto the man

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.080
and Adam said this is now bone of my bones

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.640
and flesh of my flesh.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.059
She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:52.119
and what a joy and what a blessing to see the record

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:55.359
of the origin of man and how God has given us

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.820
that record that we are made by God.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.219
As we go back to Genesis chapter number, excuse.

00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:03.899
to Psalm chapter 139, again, I've mentioned already

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.119
that there in Genesis 1, we really are provided

00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:10.239
with the origin of man, but here in Psalms,

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:13.779
we are provided with the wonder of subsequent reproduction.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.219
The end of chapter number two there,

00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:18.519
we find that God tells them to be fruitful and multiply,

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:21.839
and we come to Psalm 139 and we read verses 13

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:24.219
and following, you begin to see the wonder

00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:26.459
of subsequent reproduction and this truth

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.779
that we are made by God.

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:31.219
I was sharing with Brianna last night

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:34.299
as we're driving home from a basketball game,

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:36.459
we were talking about, she actually brought up to me

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.539
how she was working on a devotion

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:41.139
from this particular passage of scripture

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:44.819
and that she was working on developing and what have you,

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:46.259
and I said, that's funny, I'll be preaching.

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:48.559
Actually, she knew, Holly had mentioned to her

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:50.299
when she was talking to Holly about the devotion

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.739
that, hey, that's what daddy's preaching on on Sunday,

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:54.139
and I told her last night, I said, you know,

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:56.999
I dug in and studied this passage really in a deeper way

00:10:56.999 --> 00:10:58.959
than I ever have before, and really,

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.159
we're just this past week just meditating

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.159
and meditating on this portion of scripture,

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:07.279
and it's so awesome how God made us

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:11.239
and how he knows us in the truth of that question

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:15.039
that people are so just debating today

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:16.999
of when does life begin?

00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:20.559
God's word answers the question.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:23.039
Notice with me, back in Psalm 139,

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.279
notice what the Bible says in verse number 13.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:30.279
For thou hast possessed my reins.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.479
You know that word reins is an interesting word.

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:35.079
You know what that word refers to?

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:39.679
It refers to our internal organs, the kidney.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.279
When he talks about it in plural sense,

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:45.659
he's talking about all of those internal organs,

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:47.199
and you notice here that he says,

00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:50.659
for thou hast possessed my reins.

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:52.419
Thou hast covered me, where?

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:54.379
In my mother's womb.

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:58.099
He will use, in verse number 15,

00:11:58.099 --> 00:12:00.919
when he speaks about there in that verse of scripture

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:03.619
about where life is developed,

00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:05.259
the subsequent reproduction,

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.739
he refers to it as the lower parts of the earth,

00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:10.099
and we find that he's referring to that place,

00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:12.699
and you notice here that as we see my reins,

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.679
that reference to the kidney, the internal organs,

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.619
you find in verse number 15 that he says,

00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:21.379
my substance was not hid from thee.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:26.379
That word substance means my bones or my skeletal structure.

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:31.379
He says my substance was not hid from thee

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:33.859
when I was made in secret and curiously wrought.

00:12:33.859 --> 00:12:36.419
Notice that phrase in verse number 15.

00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:38.739
This is a word that would often be used

00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:42.539
in reference to someone that was working in needlework

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:44.499
or someone that was an embroiderer,

00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.039
someone that was very skillful

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:48.859
with weaving things together and what have you,

00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:50.879
and you begin to notice how he says

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:53.119
that we were curiously wrought

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:55.919
and how God really dealing with here

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:58.279
this skillful aspect of human life.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.999
It's said, it's my understanding,

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:02.959
and I did some research to confirm this,

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:07.039
that the human body, if you were to take all of the veins

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:09.639
and all of that, that it's so long

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.359
that it could wrap around the earth twice

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:13.199
from one human being.

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:15.079
Your arteries and your veins.

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:16.179
That's amazing.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.359
You see the, he says we're curiously wrought.

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:26.079
That word used of that one that would work in embroidery

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:30.439
and in needlework and the skill of those individuals.

00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:31.279
Wow.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:35.279
But then he says this in verse number 16.

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:40.279
Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect.

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:44.999
Now it's interesting, in our English translation,

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:49.999
we find the Bible says my substance yet being unperfect.

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:52.639
That's five words in English,

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:54.679
but you know that's just one Hebrew word.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.319
One Hebrew word.

00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:58.599
You know what that word means?

00:13:58.599 --> 00:14:02.559
It's only used here in all of the Bible,

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:04.799
and it means embryo.

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:07.359
That's what it means.

00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:12.759
We find here that David is giving testimony.

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:16.039
He says I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:19.559
We find that he says that my reigns are referenced

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:22.559
to the kidney, the internal organs, my substance,

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:24.679
my bones, my skeletal structure,

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:29.399
that I'm curiously wrought, the skill of God's handiwork,

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:31.519
that I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:35.799
My substance yet being unperfect, literally the embryo,

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:38.479
and we find all of this takes place,

00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:40.599
according to verse 13 and verse number 15,

00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:41.519
where?

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.679
In the mother's womb.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:48.759
We see the origin of man in Genesis chapter number one.

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:52.319
When God formed man, God created man,

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:55.479
but we see the wonder of subsequent reproduction

00:14:55.479 --> 00:15:00.119
here in Psalm 139, and we find the testimony is given,

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:03.799
and we recognize with great clarity and great certainty

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:06.299
that we are made by God.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:13.019
We can firmly and accurately declare

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:15.679
that life begins at conception.

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:17.719
Without apology.

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:22.759
He says in verse number 14, notice,

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:26.439
he says marvelous are thy works.

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:29.399
I've never gone to medical school.

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:32.679
I've done a little research,

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:35.199
and it is absolutely amazing when you study,

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:40.399
when you study the reproduction

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.779
in everything that has to take place

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:48.359
in order for life to come.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:52.799
It's amazing, absolutely fascinating,

00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:59.039
and we find that it is marvelous, wonderful, extraordinary.

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:01.519
It's what the word means, and this morning,

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:05.079
we find that David, as he's rejoicing here

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:07.079
and understanding, he says, listen,

00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:11.159
I understand, first of all, that I'm made by God.

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.139
Notice this as we look here.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.479
Not only are we made by God,

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:15.799
but I want you to notice, number two,

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:18.359
we are known by God.

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:19.579
We are known by God.

00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:23.719
It's interesting, last week in Psalm 147,

00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:26.119
we stood in amazement at understanding

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.799
that the Bible record in Genesis 1

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:30.919
simply says that he made the stars also,

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:32.859
and we gave estimate with regard

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:35.519
to how many stars there are in the universe

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.399
and all of that, and we said that it's interesting

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.699
in Psalm 147, and we stand in amazement

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:45.479
to know the truth that God, he knows their number,

00:16:45.479 --> 00:16:47.659
and he calls them all by their names.

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:52.399
But you know, he didn't die for a star.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.699
He died for you, and he died for me.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:59.919
So if he knows the number of the stars

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.999
and he knows their name, and he calls them all

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:05.119
by their name, I'm so thankful this morning

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.359
to know that I'm known by God,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.959
and you are known by God, and he knows everything

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:14.279
about us, and even though he knows everything

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:15.599
about us, you know what's amazing?

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.079
He still loves us.

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.639
He still loves us.

00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:24.079
He knows everything about us.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.199
Notice as the psalm begins in verses one through four

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:32.839
of Psalm 139, the psalmist says this,

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:37.459
O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me.

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:42.239
Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up-rising.

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:44.879
Notice what he says, thou understandest

00:17:44.879 --> 00:17:48.119
my thought afar off.

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:52.119
Thou compassest my path and my lying down,

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:56.319
and art acquainted with all my ways,

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.879
for there's not a word in my tongue,

00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:02.879
but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it all together.

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:08.599
We'll stop and just meditate on the truth

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:10.499
that we're known by God.

00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:12.279
He knows us.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:13.879
He knows our name.

00:18:13.879 --> 00:18:15.439
He knows our thoughts.

00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:17.079
He knows what we're dealing with.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:20.119
He knows where you are right now in your life.

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.819
He knows everything about you.

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.019
It's interesting, as we understand this truth,

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:26.479
look over at the book of Matthew, if you will,

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:28.119
look at two verses of scripture.

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:30.239
In Matthew chapter number nine, I'll say this,

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:31.839
that he knows our thoughts.

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:36.000
Some of us have a hard time remembering our thoughts.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.919
Amen?

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:39.919
The older we get, it seems like the easier

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.719
we forget our thoughts.

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.819
And someone said, I had a train of thought,

00:18:43.819 --> 00:18:45.939
I just don't know where it derailed.

00:18:45.939 --> 00:18:50.879
And the reality is that God knows our thoughts.

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:53.319
In Matthew nine, in verse number four,

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:54.539
notice what the Bible says.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:55.799
Actually, I'll begin in verse number one.

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.799
It says, and he entered into a ship and passed over

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:59.279
and came into his own city.

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:01.459
And behold, they brought him to him,

00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:03.519
a man sick of the palsy, laying on a bed.

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:04.959
And Jesus, seeing their faith,

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.139
sent him to the sick of the palsy.

00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:07.719
Son, be of good cheer.

00:19:07.719 --> 00:19:09.879
Thy sins be forgiven thee.

00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:12.159
Behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:13.519
this man blasphemeth.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.359
Why would they take that perspective?

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:17.519
Well, they say, as it's recorded in another gospel,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.759
that they said only God can forgive sins.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.919
By the way, that's true.

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:24.959
But Jesus is God.

00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:29.799
Thus, Jesus could say, thy sins are forgiven.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.439
And we find that the Bible tells us in verse number four,

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:37.439
and Jesus, knowing their thoughts,

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:40.559
said, wherefore think ye evil in your heart?

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:43.759
Now, can you imagine how they must have responded

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:45.639
when they heard Jesus say,

00:19:45.639 --> 00:19:47.159
why are you thinking what you're thinking?

00:19:47.159 --> 00:19:48.879
They'd not yet made it public.

00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:51.159
They'd not verbalized their thoughts,

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:54.219
but Jesus knew what they were thinking.

00:19:55.239 --> 00:19:57.119
He knows our thoughts.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:57.959
He knows our thoughts.

00:19:57.959 --> 00:19:59.479
I remember teaching a...

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:01.719
passage of scripture, I think it was this one,

00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:04.079
it might have been the account in Mark,

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.599
was teaching this in vacation Bible school

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:07.879
probably back in 2012.

00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:09.159
A little boy sitting in my class

00:20:09.159 --> 00:20:11.479
as I was teaching that class and we were downstairs,

00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:13.839
actually in the classroom now where

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:16.159
the nursery, nursing room is,

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.719
that was a classroom back then,

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:20.719
there wasn't a door there to join the two rooms.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:21.719
And I was sitting there and I was teaching

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:24.319
and I talked about how God knows our thoughts.

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.519
There's a little boy sitting in our class

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:27.759
about nine years old, eight years old,

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:30.319
and it just absolutely blew his mind.

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:34.639
I mean, he sat in absolute awe of

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:36.879
God knows what I'm thinking.

00:20:36.879 --> 00:20:38.919
Yeah, he does.

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:40.279
He knows our thoughts.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.139
He knows everything about us.

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:45.239
I want you to think about this.

00:20:45.239 --> 00:20:46.559
I said we look at two verses here

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.559
from Matthew, turn to chapter number 10.

00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:51.599
The Bible tells us that he knows

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:55.319
the very hairs on our head.

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:59.199
And you want to talk about getting detailed.

00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:03.079
You want to talk about how well he knows us.

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:06.999
The Bible says in Matthew 10 in verse number 30,

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:11.999
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:15.139
That's fascinating.

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:18.839
See, we could only estimate last week

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:19.839
when we looked at the stars,

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:21.759
we could only estimate their number.

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:23.919
We do not know for certainty or accuracy

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:24.759
the number of stars.

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.159
We estimate based on what science tells us

00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:29.319
as to what they have been able to project

00:21:29.319 --> 00:21:30.279
the number of stars to be,

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.119
but we say that God knows their number

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:34.039
and he calls them all by their name.

00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:35.599
But then when we begin to think about us

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:38.479
as individuals and how much he knows us,

00:21:38.479 --> 00:21:40.279
remember, we're made by him,

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.619
but we're known by him.

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:46.079
He knows the very number of the hairs on your head.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:49.039
I've often said as I've looked at that passage,

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.999
he's got to do subtraction for me.

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:54.519
And for some, he's doing addition and multiplication,

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:57.039
but someone reminded me recently

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.759
of how little hair I have.

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:01.359
In fact, it was the guy moving the chairlift

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:03.359
and I said, listen, man, I'm not gonna help you

00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:05.479
if you're gonna keep picking on me, you know?

00:22:05.479 --> 00:22:08.919
But the reality is that God knows the number

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:12.959
and he doesn't just know about the number.

00:22:12.959 --> 00:22:14.479
He knows the number.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:16.079
Think about that.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:18.779
There's like eight billion people in the world today.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.079
It's okay.

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.259
Our God is great.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:27.339
He's got all knowledge, all wisdom, all power,

00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:32.339
and he knows the very number of the hairs on our heads.

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.019
We're known by God.

00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:39.019
We're made by God.

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:40.619
We're known by God.

00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:42.239
And then let me say this.

00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:45.079
We are valued by God.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.739
We are valued by God.

00:22:46.739 --> 00:22:50.059
Notice what the Bible says back in Psalm 139.

00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:52.099
I want you to look at verses 17 and 18.

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:56.619
I want you to consider with me this morning

00:22:56.619 --> 00:23:00.139
that life is a precious gift from Almighty God.

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:05.279
We thank God for the life that he gives,

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:07.939
but we can rejoice in knowing

00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:10.259
that though we have this physical life

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:14.179
that he valued us so much that he died

00:23:14.179 --> 00:23:16.399
so that we might have eternal life.

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:19.639
The gift of God is eternal life

00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:21.979
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:23:21.979 --> 00:23:24.079
And how we ought to rejoice this morning

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:27.119
in understanding that we are valued by God.

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:29.039
Notice what the Bible says in verse 17.

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:31.439
After the psalmist in verses 13 through 16

00:23:31.439 --> 00:23:33.879
is rejoicing in understanding that we're made by God

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:37.119
and the wonder of this subsequent reproduction

00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:40.099
and how God knows us and all that he does

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:42.119
and how he fashions and so on and so forth.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:43.559
And he says in verse 17,

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:48.559
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me,

00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:52.719
O God, how great is the sum of them.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:56.519
If I should count them,

00:23:56.519 --> 00:24:00.239
they are more in number than the sand.

00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:03.599
When I awake, I am still with thee.

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:04.839
What did you think about last week?

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:07.479
We talked about the stars and the number of them.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.319
Now you look at the number of the sand.

00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:10.679
He says, if I should count them,

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:13.759
they are more in number than the sand.

00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:15.119
You ever try to count sand?

00:24:16.879 --> 00:24:18.359
Why would you try?

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:22.559
You must be outside of your mind, right?

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:24.719
I mean, you wanna talk about somebody being bored?

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:26.559
That takes it to a whole new level.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:29.759
I think I'm gonna go over here and count sand.

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:31.079
Really?

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:33.599
I don't think anyone's ever said that.

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:37.119
I said I don't think anyone's ever said that, all right?

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:39.159
Because it doesn't make sense in my mind.

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:43.719
But the psalmist says,

00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:48.719
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God,

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:52.999
how great is the sum of them.

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:56.399
If I should count them,

00:24:56.399 --> 00:24:58.959
they are more in number than the sand.

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.079
When I awake, I am still with thee.

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:08.079
You know, I'm so thankful that we're valued by God.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:14.079
See, God made us, God knows us,

00:25:15.199 --> 00:25:17.199
and we are valued by God.

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:20.839
Begin to think about this truth this morning

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:22.599
in looking what the psalmist says

00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:24.999
and understanding how God knows us

00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:28.199
and how God has us on his mind.

00:25:28.199 --> 00:25:30.919
And we've often mentioned about the example

00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:35.559
of the Apostle Paul praying for the believers in Philippi

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:37.199
and looking at that truth.

00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:39.559
And Philippians one of how he refers to them

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:42.599
and how he's talking about praying for them.

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:44.919
And we've often, as we've looked at that passage

00:25:44.919 --> 00:25:47.159
of scripture, we've said, why is Paul saying,

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:49.159
I thank God upon every remembrance of you?

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:50.719
Why is he thinking about them?

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:53.839
He says, because I have you in my heart in verse number seven

00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:57.199
and the thoughts that he has of them,

00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:59.919
the people in Philippi, those believers

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.919
are because he has them in his heart.

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:04.379
And I rejoice in understanding this morning

00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:07.119
that God loves me with an unconditional love

00:26:07.959 --> 00:26:08.799
with an everlasting love.

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:11.119
And he's thinking, he has thoughts about us

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:12.919
and his thoughts are precious

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:14.479
according to what the psalmist says.

00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:17.199
And we this morning begin to understand

00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:20.059
that my life is valued by God.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.959
What a blessing.

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:26.539
You understand this morning that every life

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:30.079
is valued by God and we understand that biblically

00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:33.539
for really two basic reasons.

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:35.699
Number one, we're made by God.

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:39.499
If we're not made by God,

00:26:39.499 --> 00:26:42.699
the value of life decreases exponentially.

00:26:43.719 --> 00:26:45.599
If Darwinian evolution is true,

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:47.739
then life really has no value.

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:54.139
And you understand that the perpetuity of that teaching

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:58.099
and the seeking to influence a generation of people

00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:59.979
that do not value life, why?

00:26:59.979 --> 00:27:02.059
Because life is just some random chance

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:03.659
and it's the survival of the fittest

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:04.619
and so on and so forth.

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:06.659
And if Darwinian evolution is true,

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:08.659
then life really has no value.

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:12.299
But God made man.

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:15.819
We're made by God.

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:18.139
We're valued by God.

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:23.539
And I am so thankful this morning that life has value

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:28.539
because life is the direct result of God's handiwork.

00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:32.959
And God made man and man has value

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:35.439
because we've been made by God.

00:27:35.439 --> 00:27:38.319
We've been made in the image and the likeness of God.

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:40.999
We're eternal with body, soul, and spirit

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:43.279
and the opportunity, the ability to be able

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:46.719
to commune with God and have fellowship with God.

00:27:46.719 --> 00:27:49.479
Wow, it's absolutely amazing.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.479
It's no wonder today

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.399
that it seems as if we continue to read

00:27:57.399 --> 00:28:01.039
of tragic loss of life.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.159
Perhaps you saw on your phone this morning,

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:06.279
just as I did, of another mass shooting

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:10.439
that took place overnight in California.

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:14.919
And we continue to see this in our society

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:17.719
and around our globe, but we continue to teach

00:28:17.719 --> 00:28:19.699
that life really has no value.

00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:25.239
No wonder they behave the way that they do.

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:28.959
But this morning, as the people of God,

00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:32.199
we understand that we are valued by God,

00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:35.760
that God loves us, that God thinks about us,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.639
that we are valued by God, why?

00:28:37.639 --> 00:28:39.519
Because we're made by him.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:45.599
We have great value because we're made in the image of God.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.079
We're to have dominion, if you read the text with me

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:51.959
in Genesis chapter one, over all of the other creation.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.639
That's what God's design is.

00:28:55.639 --> 00:28:57.880
We live in a time in which there are many

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.880
that value the creation more than the creator, right?

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:06.719
The creature more than the creator,

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:10.159
and they value the creature more than human life.

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:14.000
It's amazing.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.399
It's Romans one being worked out, it really is.

00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:26.339
And we find this morning that we're made by God,

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:29.659
that we're known by God, that we're valued by God.

00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:31.299
I said for two reasons, number one,

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:32.899
that we're made in the image of God,

00:29:32.899 --> 00:29:34.599
but think about this, number two,

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:40.619
that Jesus Christ, who is God, died for mankind.

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:47.260
You know how much value that places on your life,

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.260
on the life of man, that God robed in human flesh,

00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:57.739
went to the cross of Calvary, shed His precious blood

00:29:57.739 --> 00:29:59.299
so that you could be redeemed.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:05.939
so that I could be redeemed. Does that not show great value? Does that not show worth?

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:12.019
We begin to think about the value of things when we talk about different things in our world today.

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:16.659
We're going to talk about the value of something and what someone would be willing to pay.

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.979
Oftentimes, you'd hear somebody say, well, this is worth x. Well, it's really only worth that

00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:27.219
if someone's willing to pay that. Right? Would you agree? And so we find that today,

00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:34.739
we begin to think about, well, what was paid for me? God died for me. The Lord Jesus Christ

00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:40.179
came to this sin-cursed world. He lived a perfect and sinless life, and he went to a cruel cross,

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:47.939
and he bled, and he suffered, and he died for me, for you. What value

00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:59.859
he placed upon his creation, upon mankind. Wow. This morning,

00:31:01.939 --> 00:31:09.859
I stand in awe of thinking about human life, the gift of life. But I stand in awe

00:31:10.419 --> 00:31:14.499
and understand the value that God has placed on each and every one of us,

00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:19.779
being willing to die for us. Look at the verse. It's a familiar verse, John 3,

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:26.339
in verse number 16. It's a verse that many could quote, no doubt.

00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:40.259
But in John 3, in verse number 16, the Bible says this,

00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:49.139
for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.

00:31:49.299 --> 00:31:56.099
We sang it this morning, whosoever will. It says here that whosoever believeth in him

00:31:56.899 --> 00:32:04.259
should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn

00:32:04.259 --> 00:32:13.859
the world, but that the world through him might be saved. Why? Because he valued.

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:19.619
Listen, you understand that Jesus was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world.

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:26.899
In eternity past, if we look at it from that perspective, from our human perspective,

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:34.899
God designed a plan for you and I, for mankind to be redeemed. Yes, for us to be created,

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:40.659
but he knew that we'd fall because he knows all things. And he knew that man would need to be

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:53.299
redeemed. And the plan of redemption was developed by God. God would take on human flesh and die.

00:32:54.659 --> 00:32:59.539
He would rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave. It says in John 3, in verse 36,

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:03.779
he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. And he that believeth not the Son shall

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:12.019
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. I'm so thankful this morning that God loved me

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:19.699
and God valued me. I'm thankful that he made me. I'm thankful that he knows me. I'm thankful that

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:27.059
he valued me. You know, in Romans chapter number 5, we mentioned Romans 10 earlier this morning

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:31.379
after we sang that song, Whosoever Will, but I want you to notice over in Romans chapter number

00:33:31.699 --> 00:33:38.099
5, if you will, the Bible gives us great truth in this passage. We can't read all 21 verses

00:33:39.139 --> 00:33:45.299
with regard to the sin of mankind and the sin entering into the world of Adam and all that

00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:51.699
takes place, but I just want to look at a couple of verses here in Romans 5. Notice in verse number

00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:59.299
1, the Bible says this, therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:05.219
Jesus Christ. Think about that truth of justification. He says that we're justified,

00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:12.899
how? By faith, not by works. We're justified by faith. And we understand this morning that

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:18.979
that work of justification, it's recognizing that Jesus Christ is God and he died on a cruel cross

00:34:18.979 --> 00:34:25.779
and he was sinless and he was perfect and the just for the unjust and he went to that cruel cross

00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:30.899
and he bled and he died and he suffered and he was buried but he rose again and we're justified

00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:39.539
by faith. And then he says this, we have peace with God. How? Through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:45.699
Because the reality is that before we placed our faith, before we were justified by faith,

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:52.659
we were at enmity with God. There was no peace between me and God, there was enmity between me

00:34:52.659 --> 00:35:01.619
and God. I needed to be redeemed, I needed to be reconciled. Why? Because my sin, your sin,

00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:12.819
is a barrier between us and God. And it has to be dealt with. And I can't resolve my own sin.

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:20.579
You can't resolve your own sin. I can't resolve your sin for you. And you can't resolve my sin

00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:30.899
for me. Only Jesus. Only Jesus. And that's why he says, listen, we were at enmity, but he says

00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:36.899
we have now, we have peace with God. Why? Because we've been justified by faith, so we've trusted

00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:41.379
the Lord Jesus Christ, our personal Savior. It's not by works of righteousness which we have done,

00:35:41.379 --> 00:35:45.779
but according to his mercy he hath begotten us. For by grace are you saved through faith and that

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:53.059
not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And we find

00:35:53.059 --> 00:36:02.659
that we're justified and we have peace through the Lord Jesus Christ. There's no way to have

00:36:02.659 --> 00:36:13.059
peace with God apart from Jesus. It's impossible. But this morning, we rejoice in knowing that we

00:36:13.059 --> 00:36:23.059
can have peace with God because of Jesus. Glory, hallelujah. He valued us. He died for us. It says

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:29.699
in Romans 5 and verse 3, but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners,

00:36:31.139 --> 00:36:35.699
Christ died for us. We're his enemies.

00:36:36.259 --> 00:36:45.059
But he died for us. Why? Because he loves us, because we're valued by God. And this morning,

00:36:45.779 --> 00:36:52.179
I hope that as we look at this passage in Psalm 139, a familiar passage of Scripture,

00:36:53.139 --> 00:36:58.099
we often read the words of verse number 14, I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:03.940
I am fearfully and wonderfully made. We hear it often, and it's good.

00:37:05.539 --> 00:37:13.699
But when we really dig into the passage, I hope this morning that we recognize we're made by God.

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:22.739
We're not made of ourselves. God gives us the record of the origin of man in Genesis 1,

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:33.539
how He formed Adam from the dust, and then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

00:37:34.899 --> 00:37:41.619
Reminds me of one of our missionaries over in Senegal, the Medes. You know, in America,

00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:46.579
so often we say, we love you with all my heart. Right? You ever use that expression?

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:51.459
You know what they say in Senegal? I love you with all my nose.

00:37:53.699 --> 00:38:00.419
You say, what? Yeah, Medes' nose. You know why they say that? Because they believe the record

00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:07.379
of Genesis 1, that God breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life. And so, the greatest

00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:12.339
way they could express in their culture and their understanding how loving someone

00:38:12.819 --> 00:38:16.819
is, is to say, I love you with all of my heart. And so, in Genesis 1,

00:38:18.259 --> 00:38:24.659
with all of their nose, not heart, because that's where the life came from. It's pretty interesting,

00:38:25.779 --> 00:38:34.419
pretty fascinating. We read of God giving the record of the origin, but then He said,

00:38:34.419 --> 00:38:40.339
be fruitful and multiply. And so, in creating Adam and then using a rib and causing that deep sleep

00:38:40.339 --> 00:38:46.339
He then tells the first created human beings, Adam and Eve, He says, be fruitful and multiply.

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:52.820
And so, in creating them, the God of all power and all wisdom, He gave them,

00:38:52.820 --> 00:39:00.820
because He's a God of order, the ability to reproduce. And the record of Psalm 139 gives us

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:06.260
the wonder of subsequent reproduction. How does it work? And we read in the text of Scripture

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:14.739
that we're made by God. God knows the internal organs, the skeletal structure, the embryo.

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:27.859
When does life begin? At conception, in the womb. Why do we value life? Because God values life.

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:35.380
Because life, man, is made in the image of Almighty God.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.739
And because we're made in the image of God, there's value.

00:39:43.059 --> 00:39:50.979
And then God died for man. Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. Oh, how thankful we ought to be.

00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:59.219
For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might

00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:09.039
be made the righteousness of God in him. It's like Corinthians 5 and verse 21. This morning,

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:18.639
I hope that we rejoice in knowing the truth that we're made by God, that we're known by

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:27.039
God, and that we are valued by God. I hope this morning that as we understand those truths,

00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:33.619
that we would take and understand that the truth of redemption is so closely related

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:38.259
to what we're dealing with this morning and how we ought to recognize the need to be redeemed.

00:40:38.259 --> 00:40:42.119
If you've not trusted Christ as your Savior this morning, understand that God loves you

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:46.579
and he values you and he died for you so that you could be redeemed, so that you could have

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:54.179
your sins forgiven, so that you could know that heaven is your home. We live in a world

00:40:54.179 --> 00:41:06.959
today that's debating so many of these things. The origin of man, when does life begin? These

00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:15.659
things are being debated. They're debated regularly. And many of our young people are

00:41:15.659 --> 00:41:19.339
being given an answer different than what I proclaimed this morning from this pulpit

00:41:19.439 --> 00:41:30.239
from this book. We cannot have our head in the sand. We must recognize this morning that

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:39.599
life does have value. And we must, as I mentioned that we're made by God, we can accurately

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:46.679
and firmly declare that life begins at conception. We're not to be ashamed of that. We fight

00:41:46.699 --> 00:42:01.139
for that. There's a stain on America, on the world, with the shedding of innocent blood.

00:42:01.139 --> 00:42:09.739
We find this morning that we must proclaim to a group of people, a young generation that's

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:15.659
rising up that does not understand that life has value because they've been taught Darwinian

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:25.919
evolution. They've been taught that there is no God. They deny that Jesus died to save

00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:36.639
anybody. But we look at the truth of the Word that God has given us and we say, thank God

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:44.999
for the plan of redemption. Thank God for the value of life. I'll say this in closing,

00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:51.419
just so you understand, I'm not, I haven't lost my mind this morning. I listened to an

00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:56.659
excerpt. It was a lengthy excerpt. It wasn't just a, you know, five-second sound bite.

00:42:56.659 --> 00:43:05.099
It was a lengthy excerpt from a man teaching at the Arizona State University, professor.

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:14.979
He was teaching, large class that he was teaching, and he said this in his classroom. He said,

00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:23.839
this idea that Jesus died for you is ridiculous. And then he went on to say this because he

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:30.479
was teaching this idea of evolution. He said that a star had to die for you so that you

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:40.679
could have life. That's what he said. That's what's being taught in our education system.

00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:48.019
That's what's being taught. I'm so thankful that Jesus died for me. I'm so thankful that

00:43:48.019 --> 00:43:55.779
I was, I am, and you are fearfully and wonderfully made. What did the psalmist say? I will praise

00:43:55.779 --> 00:44:01.899
thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. He knows me. He knows everything about me,

00:44:01.899 --> 00:44:09.439
but he still loves me. He still loves me. If you're saved this morning, what a great,

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:21.879
great privilege that we have to tell someone else God loves you. He loves you. He values you. He

00:44:21.879 --> 00:44:28.519
made you, and he died for you because he loves you so much. This morning I am fearfully and

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:35.699
wonderfully made. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. How we

00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:40.419
thank you for the record that you've given us as we've looked at these two portions of Scripture

00:44:40.419 --> 00:44:49.699
this morning and see the origin of man, the wonder of subsequent reproduction. And Lord,

00:44:49.699 --> 00:44:56.899
I pray you'd help each and every one of us to rejoice in the truth that we are made by you.

00:44:56.899 --> 00:45:07.199
We are known by you, and we are valued by you. Lord, I pray this morning that if there's one

00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:12.599
that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, whether they're here locally or

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:22.319
they're tuned in via live stream, they do not have assurance of heaven, I pray this morning that today

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:31.579
would be the day of their salvation. That they would recognize, God, you love them, that you died

00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:40.579
for them. They would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. I pray

00:45:40.579 --> 00:45:46.819
for every child of God, each one that's here this morning that's been saved. We've been justified,

00:45:46.919 --> 00:45:53.639
we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to

00:45:53.639 --> 00:46:02.199
rejoice and praise you as the psalmist said. I pray that you'd help us to proclaim this message

00:46:02.199 --> 00:46:18.139
far and wide. We're seeing an attack. God, we must stand up for righteousness, for the truth

00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:26.739
of your word. And I pray this morning that you'd give us boldness, give us power. I pray, Lord,

00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:37.119
that you'd help us to be good representatives and witnesses of you. I pray that in these moments

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:41.759
of invitation that you'd move and work as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for

00:46:41.759 --> 00:46:45.599
every decision that's made. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand?
