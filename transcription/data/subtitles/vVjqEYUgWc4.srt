1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sure that's hard for you guys to believe.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,000
2 Corinthians chapter 5, and we've spent several weeks in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We will finish out the chapter this morning looking at verse number 21.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you've looked at the bulletin today, you've noticed the front of the bulletin,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
it says, God is faithful. Aren't you thankful for that?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Bible says, faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Often you find throughout the scriptures the wonderful truth that God is faithful.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we sing the song, great is thy faithfulness. Amen.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And what a blessing to consider the fact that God is faithful.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you looked at the back, you saw the memory verse for the month of May.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We are in the first Sunday of the month of May, 2 Corinthians 13 and verse 14.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We'll be working on that.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And this morning, the title for the message, the great transaction.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 is a verse of scripture that many of us are familiar with.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And let me just recap quickly of what we've looked at in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 over the last several weeks.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We've spent a long time in this single chapter of scripture because it's so rich and God has so much for us.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We started out by dealing with the certainty and the reality of heaven.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What a blessing to know for sure that heaven is your home, not because of anything that you've done,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but all because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He took your sin and my sin and the sin of the world.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And he died, he bled his precious blood, he was buried and he rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He is alive forevermore. He's coming back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And the apostle Paul begins to deal with the certainty and the reality of heaven in this text of scripture.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In 2 Corinthians 5, that familiar verse, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And how thankful we are, how many times I've gone and visited the first 8 verses of 2 Corinthians 5 at funerals

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and seeking to encourage people with the certainty and the reality of heaven.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then we dealt with the fact that we ought to live our lives to please the Lord.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In verse number 9 of 2 Corinthians 5, the apostle Paul said,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That word acceptant means well-pleasing.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And we spent a whole message on verse number 9 talking about living our lives to please the Lord.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The thankful or unthankful this morning because God gives us truth in his word

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that we can know that if we're living in such a way that he is pleased.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The Bible tells us of instances in which God's people behaved in a certain way where he was not well-pleased with them.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In fact, the reality this morning is that we live in this deceived culture,

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the children of Israel lived in it as well,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
where they think that they could live contrary to the principles that God has given in his word,

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but yet just bring some sacrifices and we're just going to make God happy

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because we're going to bring our sacrifices while we're living wicked, ungodly lives.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And God says, I don't want your sacrifices, I want your heart.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's about what you do and how you live, and we ought to live, we ought to strive,

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we ought to labor to be accepted of him, to please him.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We said this, we're not trying to please him so that we can go to heaven.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We already have that settled at the cross.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Our pleasing him is because now he's our father and I'm his child

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and I have the opportunity to live my life in such a way that I can have God's favor in my life.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want God's favor, don't you?

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And what a blessing to know that our God will give us his favor,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
he will bless us as we live in obedience.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We then dealt with the fact that we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I hope this morning that that truth is impactful in your life.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're going to stand before Christ one day.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the reality is that there are two judgments that the Bible speaks of.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
One is the judgment seat of Christ, or the bema, as we'll often refer to it as,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and that's for the believers, those that know Christ as their personal savior.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We will not be judged for our sin, but we understand that our works

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and what sort they are, the motives.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And here's the reality is that we will either receive reward or we will suffer loss.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What a sad thing to stand at the judgment seat of Christ and receive no rewards.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
To have no crowns, to be able to cast back at the throne of God,

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
we read that in Revelation 4.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We find this morning that we're going to stand before Christ one day

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and it led us right into the thing that we should live for Jesus.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Understand we're going to stand before him, we're going to stand.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Listen, you're not going to deceive Christ when you stand before him.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's nothing that you're going to, he knows everything, he knows your motives.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we should live for Jesus.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The reality is that we can live for self.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's a lot of people in our world that are living for self,

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but there's people in God's house that are living for self

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and they fit their schedule as priority and so on and so forth.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And we find that we should live for Jesus

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and what a blessing it is to live for Christ.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We looked at the text of Scripture that he died for all,

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hallelujah that I can live for Jesus.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Amen.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Make my life count, make your life count that you're living for Jesus.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're not just living for yourself,

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you're not just living for some cause that's going to fizzle out.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Remember the disciples early on when they stood there

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and they were all kinds of uproar in Jerusalem

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and Gamaliel stands and says,

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
listen if this thing be of man it's just going to fizzle out,

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but it's of God.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're going to find yourself fighting against God.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And what a blessing to live for Jesus.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then we talked about the power of the gospel to transform lives.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Aren't you thankful?

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm thankful that God's words, that the gospel saves,

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but the gospel transforms.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not who I used to be.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
My father-in-law, I don't know how many times it is a week,

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
probably three times a week, maybe four times a week.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He sends out a little devotional thought to just a group text.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's just a few of us on the group text.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As far as I know, it's just Holly and I and Breonna and Joseph.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He may have other group texts that he does with other parts of the family,

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but he sends this group text.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And he sent this text this week about the Lord's day,

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
about Sunday, the Lord's day, and about how we're to honor the Lord

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and how we're to make it the Lord's day, not the Lord's hour.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And he kind of dealt with some things.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I replied to that text message.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And here's what I said to him.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I said, you know, I come from a different perspective.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Here's the perspective that I come from.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I didn't get saved until I was almost – well, I got saved when I was 17,

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
but my family didn't get saved until I was almost 13.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You know what we did on the Lord's day?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Whatever we wanted.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
God was as far from it was anything that we could fill up with our schedule.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then we got saved.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Guess what?

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the Lord's day.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I want to be in church.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I want to worship the Lord.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There are things that I have to say, hey, I'm not going to do that.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why?

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because it's the Lord's day.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Amen?

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And what a blessing to understand the gospel transforms an individual.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The things I used to do, the way I used to think, the priorities I used to have,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they're all different now.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why?

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because I'm saved.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm a child of the king.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I'm a new creature.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And if you're saved, so are you.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then we spoke about for two weeks our position as ambassadors.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We said this last week, what kind of an ambassador are you?

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The reality is that we understand that we are ambassadors.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But what kind of an ambassador am I?

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because the Bible says that a faithful ambassador brings health.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And what a blessing when we consider the truth of the plea for faithful ambassadors.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I hope this past week that you had an opportunity to be able to share the gospel with someone,

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to be able to have that opportunity to talk to somebody about Jesus.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we come to this familiar verse of Scripture as we finish up 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Notice what the Bible says.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a powerful, powerful verse of Scripture.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
For he, the he that begins this verse of Scripture speaking of God the Father,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
hath made him, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, to be sin for us.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
To be sin for us.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Notice this, who knew no sin.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What a transaction.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
As we look at this verse of Scripture this morning, I hope that if you have been saved,

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
if you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior this morning,

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I hope this morning that you will rejoice at understanding the great transaction that took place.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not in our song book, but in an old hymn.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The old account was settled long ago.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And what a blessing to understand that my account was full of sin.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so was yours.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, who knew no sin,

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
went to that cross and bore the sin of the world,

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and he offers to me righteousness in exchange for my sin.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's amazing.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I hope you rejoice in it.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you're not saved this morning, you do not have that certainty of heaven.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's not been a time in your life where you've recognized that you're a sinner in need of the only Savior.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe you're trying your best.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to work my way to heaven.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm going to be a good person, and I'm going to try to win God's favor.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to earn God's favor.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can I tell you on the authority of God's word, you can't.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's impossible.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's by grace that you're saved.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can I tell you this morning, you say,

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
well, I don't know if I believe in God and all of this kind of thing.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Can I tell you one day you're going to stand before Him?

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're going to stand before Him.

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And on that day, it's going to be entirely too late.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's going to be too late.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's what we do with Christ.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,039
Can I tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ, during His earthly ministry, asked a question

177
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,720
to His disciples, and He asked this question, who do men say that I am?

178
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,020
They offered some answers based upon the ideas of the community and those in the region as

179
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,440
to what they thought.

180
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,920
Some think that you're Isaiah, one of the prophets, Jeremiah, so on and so forth, John

181
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
the Baptist.

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,280
I mean, they had all kinds of ideas.

183
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,159
This is who say ye that I am.

184
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:37,639
Peter stands up and says, thou art the Christ, the Messiah, the promised one, the Son of

185
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,159
the living God.

186
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,159
What a blessing to know Him as our personal Savior.

187
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,159
This morning, who is Christ to you?

188
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,959
Is He your Savior?

189
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,360
I talked to a man this two weeks ago, and he didn't believe the same thing that I believe

190
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
about who Jesus is.

191
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
And Tim, here's what I asked him.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
I said, well, you believe that Jesus is a good prophet, right?

193
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, He's a good prophet.

194
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,119
But if a good prophet lies, is He still a good prophet?

195
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,119
He said, well, no.

196
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,900
I said, well, Jesus said He was God.

197
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,839
So how can He still be a good prophet?

198
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,239
Jesus received worship.

199
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,959
How can He still be a good prophet?

200
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,959
See Jesus is God.

201
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,839
He's God in flesh.

202
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,760
And this morning, what a blessing to understand that God the Father made Him, God the Son,

203
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,040
to be sin for us, who knew no sin.

204
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
He's a perfect person.

205
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
He's perfect.

206
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
He's righteous.

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
He's holy.

208
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
He never had a wrong thought.

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
He never did a wrong thing.

210
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,879
And the Bible says that He made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might

211
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,760
be made the righteousness of God in Him.

212
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,599
Praise the Lord.

213
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,599
Take notes this morning.

214
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,440
Number one, I want you to consider the basis of the transaction.

215
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,639
Consider with me, first of all, this morning, the basis of the transaction.

216
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,839
I'll answer two questions.

217
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,959
Number one is this.

218
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,059
Why this transaction was necessary?

219
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,260
Why was the transaction necessary?

220
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,900
Why is it this morning that we look at this passage of Scripture, beginning in verse 17,

221
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,660
He talks about the fact that we're new creatures.

222
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,599
He's talking to the believers in Corinth and speaking about their salvation.

223
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,139
We understand that previous in the text, He talked about heaven and all that's taking

224
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:11,139
place.

225
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,139
I reviewed all of that.

226
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,380
And He talks about the fact that He hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

227
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,979
But who has received the ministry of reconciliation?

228
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:23,300
Beginning in verse 18, those who have been reconciled.

229
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,479
And to be reconciled means that we were at variance with God.

230
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:31,940
There was enmity, there was a divide, and we've been reconciled because of what Christ

231
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,320
did on the cross of Calvary.

232
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,979
So why was the transaction necessary?

233
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,580
We have to go back to Genesis chapter 3.

234
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,139
Turn there with me, if you will, and go to the very beginning here.

235
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:48,300
As we look in Genesis chapter 3, we know that this is the interaction where we would say

236
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,899
that it's the entrance of sin into the world.

237
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,220
And God made Adam and God made Eve.

238
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,699
He is the creator God, and He made them perfect, and He made them in a perfect environment.

239
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,080
And He gave them a command, and we find that the enemy, he comes in, and the Bible says

240
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,139
in chapter 3 and verse number 1, that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of

241
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,139
the field.

242
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:15,779
And I want you to notice what happens in Genesis chapter 3 as we look at these first few verses

243
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,919
of this chapter and understanding why the transaction was necessary, because we look

244
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,940
at the basis of the transaction, and we have to answer why it was even necessary.

245
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,320
So notice in verse number 1, now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

246
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,600
which the Lord God had made.

247
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,339
And He said unto the woman, notice the first thing that He says, yea, hath God said.

248
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,580
Can I tell you this morning that the enemy from the start, even until this very present

249
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,860
day, continues to undermine the authority of God's Word.

250
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,919
To cause doubt and to cause confusion.

251
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,699
And we find that we live in a world of so much confusion today.

252
00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:00,339
We have people that are so confused, but yet we have God's Word that gives such great clarity,

253
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,100
but people don't run to God's Word.

254
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,059
And we see that the Bible says, yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of

255
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,059
the garden.

256
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,419
And He said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but

257
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,580
of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ye shall not

258
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,179
eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

259
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:20,380
That's not exactly what God said.

260
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not going to dig into that this morning, because we want to keep on rolling.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,760
God didn't say they couldn't touch it, He said not to eat it.

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,140
Can I tell you this morning, it's important that we know what God says.

263
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Amen.

264
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,299
You ever hear somebody say, well God said, you know, He blesses those that, you know,

265
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:36,299
work hard.

266
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,100
Have you ever heard somebody say, hey listen, follow your heart.

267
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,820
I mean people say it from the pulpit, but God's Word says your heart is deceitful.

268
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,140
Don't trust in your heart.

269
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,899
That's what God's Word says.

270
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,899
We've got to know the Bible.

271
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,899
We've got to know the Bible.

272
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:59,019
The Bible says in verse number four, and the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not

273
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,100
surely die.

274
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,779
Then notice what he does.

275
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,820
This is Satan, the enemy.

276
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,220
For God doth know.

277
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,220
Can I tell you this?

278
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,140
Satan doesn't deny God.

279
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,380
There's some people that do.

280
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,059
They claim to be atheist.

281
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,059
There's no God.

282
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,980
Satan knows there's a God.

283
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,179
You'll never read one time throughout the entirety of the Bible where Satan denies the

284
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,179
existence of God.

285
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,100
In fact, during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, it's those demons that

286
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,980
say, they knew who He was.

287
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Have you come to judge us before our time?

288
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,100
Because they know what their end is.

289
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,579
So you sit, you listen, someone says, I don't believe in God.

290
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,179
Even Satan believes in God.

291
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:53,260
The Bible says, then in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes should be opened and you should

292
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,100
be as God's, knowing good and evil.

293
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
You know what?

294
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,899
You know what Satan says?

295
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,660
God's keeping something from you that's good for you.

296
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,779
So he's questioning the goodness of God.

297
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:07,779
That's what he's doing.

298
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,019
Can I tell you, we have a good God.

299
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,579
David said, taste and see that the Lord is good.

300
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,899
He knew with all things well, the Bible tells us that.

301
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,220
And here, the enemy is questioning the very goodness of God.

302
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,700
God knows that this is good for you, but He's withholding it from you.

303
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,140
And we must understand that God knows best.

304
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,660
Always in every situation you say, but this makes me feel good.

305
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,980
This pleases me.

306
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,700
Yes, but if God said no, then the answer is no.

307
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,540
Amen?

308
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,179
So what happens in verse 6, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that

309
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:55,019
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the

310
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,140
fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.

311
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,299
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed

312
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,579
fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.

313
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,380
Be careful what you see, what you look at.

314
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,700
We see that it begins in verse 6 by, she saw the tree was good for food.

315
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,019
I want to encourage you this morning as we consider why the transaction was necessary

316
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:29,380
because of an event that took place about 6,000 years ago in the Garden of Eden, where

317
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,739
mankind rebelled against the one commandment that God gave.

318
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:39,579
And at that very moment, sin entered into the world.

319
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:44,820
The Bible teaches us, if we could fast forward from Genesis 3 to Romans chapter number 5,

320
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,100
and I want you to look there in Romans chapter 5, and the Bible teaches us about the validity

321
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,899
of this record that God gives us in the book of Genesis.

322
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,260
This is wonderful about the Bible.

323
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,420
You find that throughout the scriptures, you compare scripture with scripture.

324
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,540
You find that as you study the Bible, that the New Testament records, references things

325
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,339
that took place in the New Testament, providing that validity to the particular accounts that

326
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,339
are given.

327
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,700
And we find that in Romans chapter number 5, beginning in verse number 12, the Bible

328
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,059
says this, wherefore, as by one man, sin entered into the world.

329
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,619
We just read that in Genesis 3, verses 1 through 7.

330
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:29,820
That's when the event took place, and it says, and death by sin.

331
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,299
And so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

332
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,820
We find that we come to this place this morning, that we look at this verse of scripture, and

333
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,020
we understand that the transaction was necessary because we're sinners, we're born sinners.

334
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,299
And the Bible says that this happened in the Garden of Eden.

335
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,299
And what happened?

336
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,539
It said, and the day that ye thereof shall surely die.

337
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,659
There was a spiritual aspect of it, not necessarily a physical aspect of it, because they lived

338
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:59,059
for many years physically after they died spiritually.

339
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,539
And we find that here as we look at this text of scripture, the Bible says, so death passed

340
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,859
upon all men, for that all have sinned.

341
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,260
The Bible continues in verse 13, for until the law, sin was not in the world, but sin

342
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,059
is not imputed when there is no law.

343
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,780
Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned

344
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,179
after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who was the figure of him that was to come.

345
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,140
And so we find that as we would continue reading in chapter 5, the Bible talks about the fact

346
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,859
that by one man, Adam's sin entered into the world, and that death came upon all men, that

347
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:41,940
also by one man, the Lord Jesus Christ, life comes to all of those that would accept them

348
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,619
as their personal Savior.

349
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,340
So we're seeking to answer the question this morning, why was this transaction necessary?

350
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,059
And we consider the basis of the transaction.

351
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:56,219
We acknowledge this morning that this transaction was absolutely necessary, why?

352
00:19:56,219 --> 00:20:00,260
Because it was the only way for mankind to be redeemed.

353
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,979
It was the only way.

354
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:06,039
way God had determined, if you read Ephesians chapter number one, God determined before

355
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,019
the foundation of the world that there was only one way that mankind would be saved and

356
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,559
that was through Jesus Christ.

357
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,799
We find this morning that this transaction was necessary, but then we answer this question

358
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,159
as we consider the basis of the transaction, how was the transaction completed?

359
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,479
How did this transaction get completed?

360
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:32,459
The reality is we begin to look at God's word and we begin to understand this wonderful

361
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:37,759
truth as we look at it in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, for he hath made him to be sin

362
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,659
for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

363
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,739
How did God complete this transaction?

364
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:51,019
We find the Bible tells us a verse that we memorized a couple of weeks, a couple of months

365
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:55,919
ago here even in the book of 2 Corinthians in chapter 8 and verse number 9, for you know

366
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:01,939
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became

367
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,199
poor, why?

368
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:07,899
So that we through his poverty might be rich.

369
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:13,379
He left the throne room of heaven, he left the glory, he is eternal God and he left the

370
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:18,299
throne room of heaven so that he could complete this transaction.

371
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,059
The book of Hebrews, turn there if you will, we'll look at a few verses of scripture, actually

372
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,079
several verses, beginning in Hebrews 8 and then we'll look more extensively at Hebrews

373
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,479
chapter 9, but I want you to look here in Hebrews.

374
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:36,599
We have this book and God gives us the book of Hebrews to show to us that Christ is better,

375
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,879
he's superior.

376
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,919
You say he's better than what?

377
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,919
Everything.

378
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:41,919
Everything.

379
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,639
Better than the angels, that's how it starts.

380
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:49,559
Better than Moses, better than, he just goes through, he's superior.

381
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:55,259
We come to chapter number 8 and we're dealing in this section of the book of his superiority

382
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:56,979
over the priesthood.

383
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:01,259
We could talk about the Aaronic priesthood in the Old Testament, we could look at the

384
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:08,059
fact that Christ, of course his priesthood is not through the Aaronic or Levitical priesthood,

385
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,939
it's through Melchizedek which is spoken of and we won't get into all of that, but I want

386
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:19,219
you to notice that he is, our Lord Jesus Christ is prophet, priest and king.

387
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:23,559
Notice what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 8 in verse number 3.

388
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,279
The Bible says this, for every high priest, remember earlier in the book, for we have

389
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,359
not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, he is

390
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,039
my high priest, praise the Lord.

391
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,999
And we find that the Bible says that every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and

392
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:48,939
sacrifices, wherefore it is of, notice this word, necessity, that this man have somewhat

393
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:51,399
also to offer.

394
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:55,539
So if the high priest in the Old Testament, the Aaronic, the Levitical priesthood, if

395
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:02,019
they had offerings and sacrifices they bring, the question is this, what is it that Jesus,

396
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:06,899
our great high priest, what offering would he bring because it's absolutely essential,

397
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,939
it's necessary that he would have something to offer.

398
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:15,179
Skip to chapter 9, if you will, and begin reading with me in verse number 11.

399
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,879
The Bible says in Hebrews 9 in verse number 11, but Christ, being come a high priest of

400
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:26,039
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that

401
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:31,839
is to say not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, notice, but

402
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,879
by his own blood, he entered in, what's the Bible say, once.

403
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:45,699
He entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us.

404
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,699
What was the offering?

405
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:47,699
What was the sacrifice?

406
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:51,319
Well he offered himself and he offered his blood, and the Bible tells us that he did

407
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,279
it one time and it was settled.

408
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,039
And what a blessing because we understand, and even if you were to read the 10th chapter,

409
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,519
we won't have time this morning, but if you were to read Hebrews chapter number 10 that

410
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,879
those priests, they ministered daily, they offered sacrifices daily, the day of atonement

411
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,379
was repeated annually, and they brought those offerings, and by the way, the high priest

412
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,839
had to bring an offering first for himself and then for the nation.

413
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,599
Jesus has no sin, so he only had to bring one offering, one sacrifice, and that was

414
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,159
for the sin of humanity.

415
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,959
Continue reading in verse number 13, for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes

416
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:33,799
of, and heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify it through the purifying of the flesh.

417
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:38,359
How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself

418
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:46,359
without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

419
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:52,319
And for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for

420
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,719
the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which

421
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:01,479
are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

422
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:07,079
For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator,

423
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,159
for a testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength at all

424
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,359
while the testator liveth.

425
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,359
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood, for when Moses had

426
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,959
spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and

427
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:28,199
of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people,

428
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:32,359
saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.

429
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,799
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry,

430
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,399
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood.

431
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,399
And then notice, and without shedding of blood is no remission.

432
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,719
Aren't you thankful that Christ shed his blood?

433
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:48,239
Because without the shedding of blood there's no remission.

434
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:54,679
Verse 23, it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should

435
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,559
be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than

436
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,559
these.

437
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,559
What's the better sacrifice?

438
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,519
Well, it's his own blood.

439
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,039
It's the sacrifice that Christ made when he went to that cross.

440
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,799
Verse 24, for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the

441
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:17,079
figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.

442
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:23,399
Nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest enters into the holy place

443
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,719
every year with blood of others.

444
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:29,839
Listen, he didn't have to offer, it was once for all.

445
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,839
Once for all, oh sinner, believe it.

446
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,759
Listen, in chapter 10 the Bible says in verse number 12, this man after he had offered one

447
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:41,639
sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of God.

448
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:50,959
He says, it was not to be done often, repeatedly, regularly, no, my savior, if you're saved

449
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:55,239
this morning, your savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, he went to that cross

450
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,199
one time and he shed his blood.

451
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,159
He hath made him to be sin for us.

452
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:07,699
He bore the sin of the world once for all.

453
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:14,319
He went to that borrowed tomb and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave, proving

454
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,839
that the substitutionary atonement was satisfactory to God.

455
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,439
It satisfied the demands.

456
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,879
Jesus died that horrific death because it was necessary.

457
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:31,359
The basis of the transaction was the fact that we're sinners and we're separated from

458
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,359
God and we're at enmity with God.

459
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:41,479
There's this variance between two parties and God did nothing wrong but we are the sinners.

460
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:47,999
And so God comes in his grace, remember, for God so loved the world that he gave God in

461
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:55,399
his love and his grace, he comes and he does for us what we could never do for ourselves.

462
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,039
We find that as we continue reading in verse 26, it says, for then must he often have suffered

463
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,039
since the foundation of the world.

464
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,279
But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice

465
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,279
of himself.

466
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,799
Notice that phrase, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

467
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,839
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.

468
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,679
Can I tell you this morning, if you don't know the sound of my voice, whether you're

469
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,799
here physically or you're tuned in via live stream, you're going to die one day.

470
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,919
The Bible says after this, the judgment.

471
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,119
Oh, I'm going to die and I'm just going to cease to exist.

472
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,119
Everything's going to be over.

473
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,799
No, no, the Bible says there's going to be a judgment.

474
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,639
As it's appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

475
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:46,880
I said earlier in the message this morning that once we die, it's too late.

476
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,839
For that great white throne judgment, the one that's for the lost people, you take your

477
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,519
final breath here on earth, you can't change that destination.

478
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,320
For the saved people, that Bema Seat, living to please Jesus, we focused on it twice in

479
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,399
the second Corinthians chapter five in a single chapter.

480
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,159
You're not going to attend one more church service, you're not going to tell one more

481
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,079
person about Jesus, you're not going to give one more dollar to help a missionary, you're

482
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,079
not going to...

483
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,079
We're going to praise him for all of eternity.

484
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,079
But that spiritual gift that he's equipped you with, the opportunities to minister and

485
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,359
to serve God, those things are all over.

486
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,359
The time is short.

487
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,399
As it's appointed unto man once to die, after this, the judgment.

488
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:39,559
So then notice verse 28, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto

489
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:46,079
them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

490
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,839
I hope you're looking for him.

491
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,479
You know, I begin to think about this truth as I look at this passage of scripture.

492
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,320
We're going to read some more scripture here in just a moment, but I'm going to think about

493
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
that.

494
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,119
You know, not that any of us will ever reach a place of sinless perfection here on this

495
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:00,440
earth.

496
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,180
It's impossible, okay?

497
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,120
We have this flesh, we understand that we're to mortify our members, we're to put off

498
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,440
the old, put on the new, we understand that we're to walk in the Spirit so that we do

499
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,760
not fulfill the lust of the flesh, but the reality is that our flesh is not eradicated

500
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
at the moment of salvation.

501
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,960
Paul, he says, the things that I would, I do not, the things that I would not, that

502
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
I do.

503
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,920
I mean, he's in this constant struggle, and we understand what it is, but who shall

504
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
deliver me from the body of this death?

505
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,960
I thank God, right, and he's thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ, but thanks be to God

506
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,840
what giveth us the victory, he says later in 1 Corinthians 15.

507
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
But I want you to understand as we look here at this text of Scripture in verse 28, so

508
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,000
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look for Him shall

509
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,080
He appear the second time without sin and salvation.

510
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,960
I wonder if you're looking for Jesus, looking for Him to appear.

511
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,400
You know who I find, those that would be looking for Jesus, those that are living a life that's

512
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,560
pleasing to God.

513
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,960
Listen, if you know that you're living a life that's not pleasing to God, you're not anxious

514
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
for Jesus to come back.

515
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,639
Am I right?

516
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:09,319
If you know that you're living a sinful life, if you know you're doing things that you ought

517
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:15,000
not be doing, you're not fully surrendered, you're not sacrificing and surrendering and

518
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,420
yielding, you're not honoring God, that in all things, all things means all things, He

519
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,920
might have the preeminence.

520
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,360
Oh, but I have to worry about, oh, I have to worry about, you just start filling in

521
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,600
the blank of all the things that people are putting in front of God today.

522
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm not just talking about lost people, I'm talking about saved people, put in front of

523
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
God today.

524
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,760
All of a sudden, you're not so anxious for Christ to appear.

525
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Why?

526
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,200
Well, John uses this little phrase at the end of John chapter number two that we would

527
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,840
be ashamed at Him at His appearing.

528
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You ever get caught with your hand in the cookie jar?

529
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,200
I know it's an expression that we use sometimes.

530
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Mom said, don't eat the cookies and she leaves the room and you're going to eat the cookie

531
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:03,040
and she walks back in and you got caught, red-handed, we'll use that terminology sometimes.

532
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,119
Listen, Jesus could come back at any moment if you're looking for Him.

533
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,800
I wonder this morning, what's the kind of person that's looking for Jesus?

534
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,600
Well, the kind of person that's living for Jesus, amen?

535
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,440
I mean, listen, if you're not where you're supposed to be, if you're not where you're

536
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,119
supposed to be, you're probably not looking for Jesus, right?

537
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,479
Because you know you're not where you're supposed to be.

538
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:33,160
And so if Jesus came back when you were not where you're supposed to be, you're going

539
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
to be ashamed.

540
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,559
Am I right?

541
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,559
Come on.

542
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,639
So what do we got to do?

543
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,400
We got to change our priorities.

544
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,600
That song that they sang, I'm going to follow Him, right?

545
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,839
Following Jesus is different than following the world.

546
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,839
Come on.

547
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,800
Following Jesus is different than following the world.

548
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,119
Surrendering all, nothing I'm going to withhold.

549
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,520
Means I got to let some things go.

550
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,160
There's some things I can't do.

551
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Means I got to…

552
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,839
They're just decisions that we make.

553
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,400
But we see the transaction was completed when Christ went to the cross.

554
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,600
He bled and He died.

555
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
Look at 1 Peter chapter 2, if you will.

556
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,000
1 Peter chapter 2, I want to begin reading in verse 21.

557
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,600
The basis of the transaction, it was necessary.

558
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,720
How was it completed?

559
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,720
Notice in 1 Peter, notice how Peter references this and what a joy to think about Peter,

560
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,279
all that transpired in his life in these moments leading up to the cross.

561
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,320
The arrest and all that Christ suffered and all that Peter dealt with and now God would

562
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,400
use him to write these words.

563
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,279
Man, it's so, so encouraging.

564
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,720
Bible says in verse 21 of 1 Peter chapter 2, for even unto, excuse me, for even here

565
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,839
unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that you should

566
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,320
follow His steps.

567
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,540
Notice this, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

568
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,080
Remember our verse this morning, 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21, for he hath made him to be sin

569
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,480
for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

570
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,000
And here it says, who did no sin, listen, he's the perfect sinless lamb of God.

571
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,720
He knew no sin, he did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth, verse 23, who when

572
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,679
he was reviled, reviled not again.

573
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,040
When he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

574
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,880
To his own self bear our sins and his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin

575
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,839
should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye were healed.

576
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,440
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the shepherd and bishop of

577
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
your souls.

578
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,480
Listen, I was going my own way.

579
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,640
Sometimes you ever hear somebody say, I found Jesus, Jesus found me, amen.

580
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:14,279
I wasn't looking for Jesus, Jesus found me, I was going my own way.

581
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:21,279
I was lost and so were you, Jesus found us.

582
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:25,519
The Bible says that we were as sheep going astray, but now are returned to the shepherd

583
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,519
and bishop of your souls.

584
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:33,080
And you think about this and understand that he bore his own self, he also bear our sins

585
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,559
in his own body on the tree.

586
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,239
Your sin, my sin.

587
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,720
He took it willingly, why?

588
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,000
Because sin has to be paid for.

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,679
Sin must be paid for and you can't pay for your own sin, absolutely impossible.

590
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,720
It's only the blood of Christ, the sinless lamb of God that took your place and my place

591
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,279
so that we could be saved.

592
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,920
It's wonderful.

593
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,799
You see here in first Peter, turn over to chapter three, if you will, maybe on the same

594
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:14,160
page for you in verse 18, the Bible says, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins,

595
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,000
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh

596
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and quickened by the spirit.

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,880
You see where it says that he might bring us to God, that truth of reconciliation.

598
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,640
We were at variance, we were separated from God because of my sin, I was on my way to

599
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
a lake of fire.

600
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,640
And so were you.

601
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,040
This truth of 2 Corinthians 5.21 is so important for us as God's people that we understand

602
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,119
the basis of the transaction.

603
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,040
Why did Christ have to die?

604
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
Why did he take upon my sin?

605
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,880
Because there's no other way.

606
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,720
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

607
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,679
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

608
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,119
That sin that entered the world in Genesis chapter number three has affected every human

609
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,839
being that's ever lived upon planet earth outside of Jesus Christ because he was virgin

610
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,559
born.

611
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,679
We find this morning the basis of the transaction.

612
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,679
Number two this morning we see this, I want you to consider the blessings of the transaction.

613
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,640
Listen, if you're saved this morning, you are blessed beyond measure.

614
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,000
If we don't have anything other than the fact that we're saved, we're blessed.

615
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,239
But shall it profit a man that gain the whole world but lose his own soul?

616
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,959
Is that not what Jesus asked?

617
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,880
God saved us.

618
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,080
If you're saved this morning, you're going to heaven.

619
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,040
But he also daily loatheth us with benefits.

620
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,200
It's overwhelming to think about how good God has been to us.

621
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,959
I want you to consider the blessings of this transaction and we could sum it up in one

622
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:59,799
statement, it's the imputed righteousness of God.

623
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:05,640
The word impute means to set to the account of, it carries with it this idea, to reckon

624
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,799
to one what does not belong to him.

625
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:17,600
Can I tell you that Christ's righteousness didn't belong to me, but he imputed it to

626
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
me.

627
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,799
That's pretty awesome.

628
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:25,880
The imputed righteousness, I didn't deserve it, you didn't deserve it, but God loved

629
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:27,799
us so much.

630
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:30,239
We're going to think about the blessings of this transaction.

631
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,840
The Bible says, he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made

632
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,479
the righteousness of God in him.

633
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:44,919
Listen, when I stand in the presence of God, it's not based upon my own righteousness,

634
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:50,080
it's based upon the fact that I am clothed with the righteousness of God, that the Lord

635
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:57,000
Jesus Christ took my sin and in exchange he gave me his righteousness.

636
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,280
It's absolutely amazing to consider.

637
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,039
What did I have to offer God?

638
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,440
Nothing.

639
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,320
Sometimes we think that we have something to offer God.

640
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,479
We have nothing to offer him.

641
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:15,039
The Bible says in Isaiah 64 that all of our good works are as filthy rags, and he took

642
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,960
all of that wickedness, he took all of that sin.

643
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,599
You say, I really wasn't that bad, really.

644
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,599
I didn't murder anybody.

645
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,159
I have people tell me that all the time.

646
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:32,919
Then we have people that think, well, you know, we start putting these levels on sin.

647
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:36,679
It's okay for me to miss this or not do that or avoid doing this.

648
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:41,919
You know, listen, sin is sin.

649
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,440
Sin is sin.

650
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:52,640
You read the list of the things that God hates, lying is in there twice out of seven.

651
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,320
Right?

652
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,960
Lying is in there twice.

653
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,080
People don't think lying is that bad.

654
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:11,040
know what Paul says in Ephesians 4? Stop lying. Speak the truth. That's what he says. We're

655
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,920
vile, wicked, have nothing to offer God. And God says, I'll take all of that and I'll give

656
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,160
you my righteousness. It just, humanly speaking, it doesn't make sense. If you want to make

657
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,340
a trade with someone, you're going to make an exchange, you're going to make a transaction

658
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,520
with someone. You're trying to get the most for your money, so to speak. I'm going to

659
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,440
try to make a fair transaction. I want to give you something that's of equal value and

660
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,240
maybe I'm going to get something that's of slightly greater value. We have nothing to

661
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,600
offer God. And he gave us his righteousness. I hope this morning we never get over that.

662
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,880
But we acknowledge this morning that we're sinners saved by grace. And now because I'm

663
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,600
a sinner saved by grace, I'm joined heirs with Christ. I'm a child of the King. Hallelujah.

664
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,960
Heaven is my home. Praise God. The Bible says this over in Romans chapter 4. Look there

665
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,600
if you will. Read a few more verses of scriptures. We deal with this blessing, considering the

666
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,200
blessing of this transaction that was completed. In Romans chapter 4, begin reading with me

667
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,160
in verse number 8. The Bible says this. Romans chapter 4, beginning in verse number 1. What

668
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:38,200
shall we say then that Abraham our father's pertaining to the flesh hath found? For if

669
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,480
Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. Romans 4 and

670
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,120
verse 2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before

671
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,120
God. See Ephesians 2 says that for by grace you're saved through faith and not of yourselves.

672
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,760
It's the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. If we get to heaven by our

673
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,880
works, then we stand before the God's throne and say we earned it. We earned it. But no,

674
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,520
it's an even playing field. It's the ground at the cross is all level. None of us can

675
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,920
earn through our works salvation. And so he says that if Abraham were justified by works,

676
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,240
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. Notice verse 3. For what saith the Scripture?

677
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,800
Isn't that always a good question to ask? Appeal to the Scripture. What does God say?

678
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,920
What's your opinion? What does God say? What saith the Scripture? I love it. What does

679
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,560
God say? Not what does your culture say, not what does the religion say, what does the

680
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,960
leader of some denomination say? No, what does God say? What does the Scripture say?

681
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,240
Notice the Bible says this, Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

682
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,920
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. God's not

683
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,640
going to owe us anything. God doesn't owe us anything. It's his grace and his mercy.

684
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,560
It says in verse number 5, but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth

685
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,320
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also described it, the blessedness

686
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,040
of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works. You see the word, we talked

687
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,160
about the imputed righteousness of God. And he says this, it's without works. Saying blessed

688
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,360
are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man

689
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,640
to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Man, I'm so thankful this morning. While I'm trying

690
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,520
to be a good person to get to heaven, how much good do you have to do? How do you ever

691
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:46,240
know if you've done enough? You understand what I'm saying? There's a world out there

692
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,540
that's living with that kind of thinking. In fact, there are people all across our region

693
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,000
today that are probably sitting in a church somewhere that have that belief. I just got

694
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,840
to be good enough. And by being in church today is one of those good enough things.

695
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,280
Doesn't matter what they did last night, doesn't matter what they're going to do this week,

696
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:16,960
it's just they were in church today. Listen, God, He imputeth His righteousness on my account,

697
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,280
on your account, if you're saved this morning, without works. Without works. Notice if you

698
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,820
will, skip down to verse number 16. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace,

699
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,400
to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is

700
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,680
of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of

701
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,460
us all. If we notice here what he says in Romans about Abraham and understanding this

702
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,480
truth of imputed righteousness, turn to the book of Galatians, if you will, and chapter

703
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,540
number 3, and we'll note just a statement that is made again here about Abraham and

704
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:59,320
about this righteousness, because the reality is that Paul is going to make a great truth

705
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,480
in Philippians that we're going to get to in just a moment with regard to understanding

706
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,200
these biblical foundational truths that go all the way back to Genesis with regard to

707
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,880
Abraham. In Galatians chapter number 3 and verse number 6, the Bible says, even as Abraham

708
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:21,840
believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. I want you to skip down and

709
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,840
look at verse number 21, if you will. The Bible says, is the law then against the promises

710
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,080
of God? God forbid. Then notice this truth, for if there had been a law given which could

711
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:41,600
have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But there was not a

712
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,800
law that could give life. The law cannot give life. The law, as we noticed earlier in the

713
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,000
book of 2 Corinthians, as we've studied and looked through this book and studied verse

714
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,680
by verse, we find that it was in chapter number 3 that there was that great contrast

715
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:08,120
between the law and grace. What does the law do? It kills. It condemns. And we find that

716
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:15,120
here Paul is saying, listen, Abraham was, he believed God and it was accounted to him

717
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,760
for righteousness. The law, it cannot give us righteousness. And then Paul says this,

718
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,640
and I know I'm kind of going backwards, but at the end of chapter 2 he says, I do not

719
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:32,200
frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

720
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,160
So what is Paul saying? Now remember the verse that we're looking at this morning, 2 Corinthians

721
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,760
5 verse 21, as we finish this great chapter in 2 Corinthians 5, the Bible says, for he

722
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,900
hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

723
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,220
of God in him. You say, but I'm going to keep the law and I'm going to become righteous.

724
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:58,660
No, righteousness cannot come by the law. And if it could, then Christ is dead in vain.

725
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,580
And if you believe that righteousness can come by the law, you've got bigger theology

726
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:08,740
problems because why did Christ die? Can I tell you this morning, my Savior, God in flesh,

727
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:20,220
he did not die in vain. He did not die in vain. He died to redeem us. To take that,

728
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:30,020
what we've referred to here as the great transaction, this exchange of my filthy rags, my sin, for

729
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:35,260
his righteousness. It's amazing. Notice what Paul says, Philippians chapter 3, and we'll

730
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:52,340
finish with this. As Paul gives his own testimony to the church here in Philippi. In Philippians

731
00:47:52,340 --> 00:48:00,300
chapter 3, Paul had, we're going to start reading verse number 4. At the end of verse

732
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,020
number 3, it says, we have no confidence in the flesh. And notice what he begins to say.

733
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,180
He says, though, verse number 4, Philippians 3, though I might also have confidence in

734
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,740
the flesh. Now, he's just said, I have no confidence in the flesh, but he's beginning

735
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:21,940
to give an illustration to these people for them to understand that righteousness is not

736
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:29,020
something we can produce on our own. So, he says this, though I might also have confidence

737
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,500
in the flesh, if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,

738
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,460
I more. And he begins to give his pedigree, if you will, circumcise the eighth day, the

739
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,380
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the

740
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,420
law of Pharisee. Concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which

741
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,540
is in the law, blameless. But what things were gained to me, those I counted lost for

742
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,260
Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things, but lost for the excellency of the knowledge

743
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,500
of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them

744
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,980
but dung, that I may win Christ, and then notice what he says in verse nine, and be

745
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:11,299
found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through

746
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:19,619
the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Paul says, you can try

747
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,260
to keep the law. I've had people, I shared this a few weeks ago, I had somebody that

748
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:29,820
was telling me that they keep, we keep the law. I've known this individual for a number

749
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,780
of years, and part of keeping the law, they believe, and they're trying to do, is keeping

750
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:42,100
the Sabbath. And for as many years as I've known them, they've broken the Sabbath. But

751
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:49,460
yet they're saying they're keeping the law. They're blinded. Remember 2 Corinthians 4?

752
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,020
In whom the God of this world hath blinded. Why? Why is he blinding their minds? Lest

753
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:59,020
the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto them. He wants to keep them lost.

754
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,180
He wants people to think they can be good enough

755
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,340
to get to heaven.

756
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,520
He wants people to think that they can have

757
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,840
enough good works to produce some level of righteousness.

758
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,620
James will later say that if you offend in one point,

759
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,140
you're guilty of all.

760
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,780
And we find here this morning that Paul says,

761
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,860
I want to be clothed,

762
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,900
I want to have the righteousness of Christ.

763
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,580
I'm not interested in trying to,

764
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,380
remember he already said in Galatians that we can't,

765
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,180
righteousness doesn't come by the law,

766
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,620
but there are people that are trying to do that.

767
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,860
You know people, I know people that are trying

768
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,660
to earn God's favor by some level of keeping the law

769
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,520
or doing some outward thing.

770
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,200
But 2 Corinthians 5.21 settles all of it.

771
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,600
Because the only way to get the righteousness of God

772
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,880
is to accept the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal savior,

773
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,380
recognizing that he took your sin

774
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,380
and he offers you his righteousness.

775
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,140
And so the question this morning really kind of boils down

776
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,260
to all of that to say this.

777
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,620
Have you experienced the great transaction?

778
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:05,260
Have you given, received, I should say,

779
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,100
have you received the righteousness of God

780
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,580
in exchange for your sin?

781
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,200
He paid for it.

782
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,020
He paid for your sin.

783
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,320
He said this on the cross of Calvary, it is finished.

784
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,040
Paid in full, done, complete.

785
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,580
But for some reason, I talk to people so often,

786
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,840
that they think there's gotta be something I gotta do.

787
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,220
There's gotta be something I gotta do.

788
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,260
And they're not willing to turn to repent

789
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,260
and turn from that false teaching and trust Christ alone.

790
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,340
Can I tell you this morning

791
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,120
that salvation is not grace plus works?

792
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,900
That's not salvation.

793
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,380
Salvation is not works.

794
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,200
Salvation is not grace plus works.

795
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,040
Salvation is Christ alone.

796
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,340
And he offers this to us.

797
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,940
If you've received it this morning,

798
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,900
if you've experienced this great transaction,

799
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,140
if you've been born again this morning,

800
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,240
I wonder this morning,

801
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,120
how much of an impact has it made in your life?

802
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,020
Are you a new creature?

803
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,180
You living for Jesus?

804
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,460
Recognizing you're gonna stand before him one day?

805
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,200
Are you living so that in all things,

806
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,580
he might have the preeminence?

807
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,540
Are you living in a life of surrender

808
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,920
as the lady sang about this morning?

809
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,940
But then what about those,

810
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,220
maybe someone's here this morning,

811
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,240
that they've never experienced this transaction?

812
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,580
They don't know that they're saved.

813
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,860
They don't know that they're forgiven.

814
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,740
Maybe they're trying,

815
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,620
they've tried to follow some religious creed,

816
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,940
some rote religion of do this and do that and go over.

817
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,460
No, listen, Christ did it all.

818
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,780
And the wonderful truth of God's word,

819
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,060
we talk about the imputed righteousness of Christ.

820
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,860
For he hath made him to be sin for us,

821
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,860
who knew no sin,

822
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,860
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

823
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,980
I stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb.

824
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,900
Amen.

825
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,500
I stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb.

826
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,500
And I wonder this morning,

827
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,420
listen, when we truly understand this message,

828
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,580
this is the message that we sang this morning,

829
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,160
send the light, the blessed gospel light.

830
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,000
Why?

831
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,360
Because we have a message that is so important.

832
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,040
We have a message that's so glorious.

833
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,240
We can't ever get over it.

834
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,760
Oh, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven.

835
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,600
So I'm gonna start doing this and doing this.

836
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,960
And I'm gonna fill my schedule with this.

837
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,800
And I'm not gonna honor the Lord over here

838
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,700
because I'm going to heaven.

839
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,200
Listen, you've missed the point

840
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,400
because I'm gonna stand before him one day.

841
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,720
I'm not gonna lose my salvation.

842
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,600
You could never lose it.

843
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,440
It's eternal.

844
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,380
But oh, you can live in such a way

845
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,140
that you don't have God's favor on your life.

846
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,820
And I want God's favor on my life.

847
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,140
The great transaction.

848
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,420
Have you been saved this morning?

849
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,240
Have you been born again?

850
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,940
If so, would you rejoice in it?

851
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,540
Would you thank God for the blessings of knowing

852
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,980
that he took all of your sin,

853
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,180
he removed them as far as the east is from the west.

854
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,580
The Bible says that he's not gonna remember them anymore.

855
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,020
They're buried in the deepest sea.

856
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,860
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

857
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,580
Glory.

858
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,300
Would you tell somebody about Jesus?

859
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,720
Because we are his ambassadors.

860
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,180
It's in the same text.

861
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,020
We're his ambassadors.

862
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,260
Will you tell someone about Jesus?

863
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,380
If you're not saved this morning,

864
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,980
the very next text in 2 Corinthians 6,

865
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,980
Paul says today is the day of salvation.

866
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,800
Listen, do not delay.

867
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,640
You don't know what's gonna,

868
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,260
I'll do that later, I'll do that after.

869
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,160
Listen, you don't know what's gonna happen this afternoon.

870
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,420
Today is the day of salvation.

871
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,260
Let us pray.

872
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,080
Father, we love you.

873
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,920
Thank you for loving us.

874
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,960
Thank you for the truth of the gospel.

875
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,160
Thank you for the power of the gospel.

876
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:00,160
We thank you this morning that Jesus saves.

877
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,640
As we consider this great transaction,

878
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,800
you took all my sin and you offer to me your righteousness.

879
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,080
Thank you, thank you, Lord.

880
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,460
Help me never to get over my salvation.

881
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,760
Then God, I pray that you would help me

882
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,240
to be faithful to tell others

883
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,840
of this wonderful, glorious truth that Jesus saves.

884
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,520
Would you move in hearts and lives as only you can?

885
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,300
I pray, God, that if there's one not saved,

886
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,660
that today, this very moment,

887
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,720
would be the day of their salvation.

888
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,280
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do.

889
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,520
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

890
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,360
Would you stand with me?

891
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,980
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

892
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,520
Holly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

893
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,480
and as she does, the altar's open.

894
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,320
If you're not sure if,
