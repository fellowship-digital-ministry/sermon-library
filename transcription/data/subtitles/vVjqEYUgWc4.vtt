00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm sure that's hard for you guys to believe.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.000
2 Corinthians chapter 5, and we've spent several weeks in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We will finish out the chapter this morning looking at verse number 21.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you've looked at the bulletin today, you've noticed the front of the bulletin,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it says, God is faithful. Aren't you thankful for that?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The Bible says, faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Often you find throughout the scriptures the wonderful truth that God is faithful.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we sing the song, great is thy faithfulness. Amen.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And what a blessing to consider the fact that God is faithful.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If you looked at the back, you saw the memory verse for the month of May.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We are in the first Sunday of the month of May, 2 Corinthians 13 and verse 14.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We'll be working on that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And this morning, the title for the message, the great transaction.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 is a verse of scripture that many of us are familiar with.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And let me just recap quickly of what we've looked at in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 over the last several weeks.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We've spent a long time in this single chapter of scripture because it's so rich and God has so much for us.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We started out by dealing with the certainty and the reality of heaven.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What a blessing to know for sure that heaven is your home, not because of anything that you've done,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but all because of what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He took your sin and my sin and the sin of the world.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And he died, he bled his precious blood, he was buried and he rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He is alive forevermore. He's coming back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the apostle Paul begins to deal with the certainty and the reality of heaven in this text of scripture.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In 2 Corinthians 5, that familiar verse, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And how thankful we are, how many times I've gone and visited the first 8 verses of 2 Corinthians 5 at funerals

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and seeking to encourage people with the certainty and the reality of heaven.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And then we dealt with the fact that we ought to live our lives to please the Lord.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In verse number 9 of 2 Corinthians 5, the apostle Paul said,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That word acceptant means well-pleasing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And we spent a whole message on verse number 9 talking about living our lives to please the Lord.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The thankful or unthankful this morning because God gives us truth in his word

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that we can know that if we're living in such a way that he is pleased.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The Bible tells us of instances in which God's people behaved in a certain way where he was not well-pleased with them.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In fact, the reality this morning is that we live in this deceived culture,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and the children of Israel lived in it as well,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
where they think that they could live contrary to the principles that God has given in his word,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but yet just bring some sacrifices and we're just going to make God happy

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because we're going to bring our sacrifices while we're living wicked, ungodly lives.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And God says, I don't want your sacrifices, I want your heart.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's about what you do and how you live, and we ought to live, we ought to strive,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we ought to labor to be accepted of him, to please him.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We said this, we're not trying to please him so that we can go to heaven.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We already have that settled at the cross.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Our pleasing him is because now he's our father and I'm his child

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and I have the opportunity to live my life in such a way that I can have God's favor in my life.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I want God's favor, don't you?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And what a blessing to know that our God will give us his favor,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
he will bless us as we live in obedience.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We then dealt with the fact that we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I hope this morning that that truth is impactful in your life.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You're going to stand before Christ one day.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And the reality is that there are two judgments that the Bible speaks of.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
One is the judgment seat of Christ, or the bema, as we'll often refer to it as,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and that's for the believers, those that know Christ as their personal savior.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We will not be judged for our sin, but we understand that our works

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and what sort they are, the motives.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And here's the reality is that we will either receive reward or we will suffer loss.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
What a sad thing to stand at the judgment seat of Christ and receive no rewards.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
To have no crowns, to be able to cast back at the throne of God,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
we read that in Revelation 4.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We find this morning that we're going to stand before Christ one day

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and it led us right into the thing that we should live for Jesus.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Understand we're going to stand before him, we're going to stand.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Listen, you're not going to deceive Christ when you stand before him.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
There's nothing that you're going to, he knows everything, he knows your motives.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we should live for Jesus.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The reality is that we can live for self.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There's a lot of people in our world that are living for self,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but there's people in God's house that are living for self

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and they fit their schedule as priority and so on and so forth.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And we find that we should live for Jesus

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and what a blessing it is to live for Christ.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We looked at the text of Scripture that he died for all,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Hallelujah that I can live for Jesus.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Amen.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Make my life count, make your life count that you're living for Jesus.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You're not just living for yourself,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
you're not just living for some cause that's going to fizzle out.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Remember the disciples early on when they stood there

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and they were all kinds of uproar in Jerusalem

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and Gamaliel stands and says,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
listen if this thing be of man it's just going to fizzle out,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but it's of God.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You're going to find yourself fighting against God.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And what a blessing to live for Jesus.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And then we talked about the power of the gospel to transform lives.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Aren't you thankful?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I'm thankful that God's words, that the gospel saves,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but the gospel transforms.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I'm not who I used to be.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
My father-in-law, I don't know how many times it is a week,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
probably three times a week, maybe four times a week.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
He sends out a little devotional thought to just a group text.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It's just a few of us on the group text.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
As far as I know, it's just Holly and I and Breonna and Joseph.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
He may have other group texts that he does with other parts of the family,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
but he sends this group text.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And he sent this text this week about the Lord's day,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
about Sunday, the Lord's day, and about how we're to honor the Lord

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and how we're to make it the Lord's day, not the Lord's hour.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And he kind of dealt with some things.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I replied to that text message.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And here's what I said to him.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I said, you know, I come from a different perspective.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Here's the perspective that I come from.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I didn't get saved until I was almost – well, I got saved when I was 17,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but my family didn't get saved until I was almost 13.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
You know what we did on the Lord's day?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Whatever we wanted.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
God was as far from it was anything that we could fill up with our schedule.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then we got saved.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Guess what?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's the Lord's day.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I want to be in church.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I want to worship the Lord.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
There are things that I have to say, hey, I'm not going to do that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Why?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Because it's the Lord's day.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Amen?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And what a blessing to understand the gospel transforms an individual.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The things I used to do, the way I used to think, the priorities I used to have,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
they're all different now.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Why?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Because I'm saved.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm a child of the king.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And I'm a new creature.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And if you're saved, so are you.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And then we spoke about for two weeks our position as ambassadors.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We said this last week, what kind of an ambassador are you?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The reality is that we understand that we are ambassadors.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But what kind of an ambassador am I?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Because the Bible says that a faithful ambassador brings health.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And what a blessing when we consider the truth of the plea for faithful ambassadors.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I hope this past week that you had an opportunity to be able to share the gospel with someone,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to be able to have that opportunity to talk to somebody about Jesus.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And we come to this familiar verse of Scripture as we finish up 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Notice what the Bible says.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's a powerful, powerful verse of Scripture.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
For he, the he that begins this verse of Scripture speaking of God the Father,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
hath made him, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, to be sin for us.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
To be sin for us.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Notice this, who knew no sin.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
What a transaction.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
As we look at this verse of Scripture this morning, I hope that if you have been saved,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
if you know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior this morning,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I hope this morning that you will rejoice at understanding the great transaction that took place.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's not in our song book, but in an old hymn.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The old account was settled long ago.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And what a blessing to understand that my account was full of sin.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And so was yours.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, who knew no sin,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
went to that cross and bore the sin of the world,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and he offers to me righteousness in exchange for my sin.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's amazing.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And I hope you rejoice in it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
If you're not saved this morning, you do not have that certainty of heaven.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
There's not been a time in your life where you've recognized that you're a sinner in need of the only Savior.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Maybe you're trying your best.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I'm going to work my way to heaven.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I'm going to be a good person, and I'm going to try to win God's favor.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I'm going to earn God's favor.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Can I tell you on the authority of God's word, you can't.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It's impossible.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's by grace that you're saved.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Can I tell you this morning, you say,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
well, I don't know if I believe in God and all of this kind of thing.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Can I tell you one day you're going to stand before Him?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You're going to stand before Him.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And on that day, it's going to be entirely too late.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It's going to be too late.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That's what we do with Christ.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.039
Can I tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ, during His earthly ministry, asked a question

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:12.720
to His disciples, and He asked this question, who do men say that I am?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.020
They offered some answers based upon the ideas of the community and those in the region as

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.440
to what they thought.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.920
Some think that you're Isaiah, one of the prophets, Jeremiah, so on and so forth, John

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920
the Baptist.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.280
I mean, they had all kinds of ideas.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.159
This is who say ye that I am.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:37.639
Peter stands up and says, thou art the Christ, the Messiah, the promised one, the Son of

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.159
the living God.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:42.159
What a blessing to know Him as our personal Savior.

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.159
This morning, who is Christ to you?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.959
Is He your Savior?

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.360
I talked to a man this two weeks ago, and he didn't believe the same thing that I believe

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
about who Jesus is.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360
And Tim, here's what I asked him.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.040
I said, well, you believe that Jesus is a good prophet, right?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.680
Oh, yeah, yeah, He's a good prophet.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.119
But if a good prophet lies, is He still a good prophet?

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.119
He said, well, no.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:06.900
I said, well, Jesus said He was God.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.839
So how can He still be a good prophet?

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:10.239
Jesus received worship.

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:11.959
How can He still be a good prophet?

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:13.959
See Jesus is God.

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:15.839
He's God in flesh.

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:20.760
And this morning, what a blessing to understand that God the Father made Him, God the Son,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.040
to be sin for us, who knew no sin.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
He's a perfect person.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040
He's perfect.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.040
He's righteous.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040
He's holy.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
He never had a wrong thought.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040
He never did a wrong thing.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.879
And the Bible says that He made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:36.760
be made the righteousness of God in Him.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.599
Praise the Lord.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.599
Take notes this morning.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:44.440
Number one, I want you to consider the basis of the transaction.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.639
Consider with me, first of all, this morning, the basis of the transaction.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.839
I'll answer two questions.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:49.959
Number one is this.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:53.059
Why this transaction was necessary?

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:55.260
Why was the transaction necessary?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.900
Why is it this morning that we look at this passage of Scripture, beginning in verse 17,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.660
He talks about the fact that we're new creatures.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.599
He's talking to the believers in Corinth and speaking about their salvation.

00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:10.139
We understand that previous in the text, He talked about heaven and all that's taking

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:11.139
place.

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:12.139
I reviewed all of that.

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:16.380
And He talks about the fact that He hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.979
But who has received the ministry of reconciliation?

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:23.300
Beginning in verse 18, those who have been reconciled.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.479
And to be reconciled means that we were at variance with God.

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:31.940
There was enmity, there was a divide, and we've been reconciled because of what Christ

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.320
did on the cross of Calvary.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.979
So why was the transaction necessary?

00:12:35.979 --> 00:12:38.580
We have to go back to Genesis chapter 3.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.139
Turn there with me, if you will, and go to the very beginning here.

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:48.300
As we look in Genesis chapter 3, we know that this is the interaction where we would say

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.899
that it's the entrance of sin into the world.

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:55.220
And God made Adam and God made Eve.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:00.699
He is the creator God, and He made them perfect, and He made them in a perfect environment.

00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:05.080
And He gave them a command, and we find that the enemy, he comes in, and the Bible says

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.139
in chapter 3 and verse number 1, that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:11.139
the field.

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:15.779
And I want you to notice what happens in Genesis chapter 3 as we look at these first few verses

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:20.919
of this chapter and understanding why the transaction was necessary, because we look

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.940
at the basis of the transaction, and we have to answer why it was even necessary.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.320
So notice in verse number 1, now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.600
which the Lord God had made.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.339
And He said unto the woman, notice the first thing that He says, yea, hath God said.

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:42.580
Can I tell you this morning that the enemy from the start, even until this very present

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.860
day, continues to undermine the authority of God's Word.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.919
To cause doubt and to cause confusion.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:54.699
And we find that we live in a world of so much confusion today.

00:13:54.699 --> 00:14:00.339
We have people that are so confused, but yet we have God's Word that gives such great clarity,

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:03.100
but people don't run to God's Word.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.059
And we see that the Bible says, yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:09.059
the garden.

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:12.419
And He said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:16.580
of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ye shall not

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.179
eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:20.380
That's not exactly what God said.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.000
I'm not going to dig into that this morning, because we want to keep on rolling.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.760
God didn't say they couldn't touch it, He said not to eat it.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.140
Can I tell you this morning, it's important that we know what God says.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.140
Amen.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.299
You ever hear somebody say, well God said, you know, He blesses those that, you know,

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:36.299
work hard.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.100
Have you ever heard somebody say, hey listen, follow your heart.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.820
I mean people say it from the pulpit, but God's Word says your heart is deceitful.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.140
Don't trust in your heart.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.899
That's what God's Word says.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:51.899
We've got to know the Bible.

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:52.899
We've got to know the Bible.

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:59.019
The Bible says in verse number four, and the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:02.100
surely die.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.779
Then notice what he does.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.820
This is Satan, the enemy.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.220
For God doth know.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.220
Can I tell you this?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.140
Satan doesn't deny God.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.380
There's some people that do.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.059
They claim to be atheist.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:19.059
There's no God.

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:21.980
Satan knows there's a God.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.179
You'll never read one time throughout the entirety of the Bible where Satan denies the

00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:27.179
existence of God.

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:31.100
In fact, during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, it's those demons that

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.980
say, they knew who He was.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.980
Have you come to judge us before our time?

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.100
Because they know what their end is.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:43.579
So you sit, you listen, someone says, I don't believe in God.

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:47.179
Even Satan believes in God.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:53.260
The Bible says, then in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes should be opened and you should

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.100
be as God's, knowing good and evil.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.100
You know what?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.899
You know what Satan says?

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:03.660
God's keeping something from you that's good for you.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.779
So he's questioning the goodness of God.

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:07.779
That's what he's doing.

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:12.019
Can I tell you, we have a good God.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.579
David said, taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:17.899
He knew with all things well, the Bible tells us that.

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:22.220
And here, the enemy is questioning the very goodness of God.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.700
God knows that this is good for you, but He's withholding it from you.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.140
And we must understand that God knows best.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.660
Always in every situation you say, but this makes me feel good.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.980
This pleases me.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.700
Yes, but if God said no, then the answer is no.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.540
Amen?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.179
So what happens in verse 6, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:55.019
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:01.140
fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.299
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:09.579
fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:14.380
Be careful what you see, what you look at.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.700
We see that it begins in verse 6 by, she saw the tree was good for food.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.019
I want to encourage you this morning as we consider why the transaction was necessary

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:29.380
because of an event that took place about 6,000 years ago in the Garden of Eden, where

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.739
mankind rebelled against the one commandment that God gave.

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:39.579
And at that very moment, sin entered into the world.

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:44.820
The Bible teaches us, if we could fast forward from Genesis 3 to Romans chapter number 5,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.100
and I want you to look there in Romans chapter 5, and the Bible teaches us about the validity

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.899
of this record that God gives us in the book of Genesis.

00:17:53.899 --> 00:17:55.260
This is wonderful about the Bible.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.420
You find that throughout the scriptures, you compare scripture with scripture.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:04.540
You find that as you study the Bible, that the New Testament records, references things

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.339
that took place in the New Testament, providing that validity to the particular accounts that

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.339
are given.

00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:14.700
And we find that in Romans chapter number 5, beginning in verse number 12, the Bible

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:21.059
says this, wherefore, as by one man, sin entered into the world.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:24.619
We just read that in Genesis 3, verses 1 through 7.

00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:29.820
That's when the event took place, and it says, and death by sin.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.299
And so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:37.820
We find that we come to this place this morning, that we look at this verse of scripture, and

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:43.020
we understand that the transaction was necessary because we're sinners, we're born sinners.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.299
And the Bible says that this happened in the Garden of Eden.

00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:47.299
And what happened?

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:49.539
It said, and the day that ye thereof shall surely die.

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:54.659
There was a spiritual aspect of it, not necessarily a physical aspect of it, because they lived

00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:59.059
for many years physically after they died spiritually.

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:03.539
And we find that here as we look at this text of scripture, the Bible says, so death passed

00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:07.859
upon all men, for that all have sinned.

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:12.260
The Bible continues in verse 13, for until the law, sin was not in the world, but sin

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.059
is not imputed when there is no law.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:19.780
Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:26.179
after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who was the figure of him that was to come.

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:30.140
And so we find that as we would continue reading in chapter 5, the Bible talks about the fact

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:35.859
that by one man, Adam's sin entered into the world, and that death came upon all men, that

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:41.940
also by one man, the Lord Jesus Christ, life comes to all of those that would accept them

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.619
as their personal Savior.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.340
So we're seeking to answer the question this morning, why was this transaction necessary?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.059
And we consider the basis of the transaction.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:56.219
We acknowledge this morning that this transaction was absolutely necessary, why?

00:19:56.219 --> 00:20:00.260
Because it was the only way for mankind to be redeemed.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.979
It was the only way.

00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:06.039
way God had determined, if you read Ephesians chapter number one, God determined before

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:11.019
the foundation of the world that there was only one way that mankind would be saved and

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:13.559
that was through Jesus Christ.

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:18.799
We find this morning that this transaction was necessary, but then we answer this question

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:25.159
as we consider the basis of the transaction, how was the transaction completed?

00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:27.479
How did this transaction get completed?

00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:32.459
The reality is we begin to look at God's word and we begin to understand this wonderful

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:37.759
truth as we look at it in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, for he hath made him to be sin

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:42.659
for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:46.739
How did God complete this transaction?

00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:51.019
We find the Bible tells us a verse that we memorized a couple of weeks, a couple of months

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:55.919
ago here even in the book of 2 Corinthians in chapter 8 and verse number 9, for you know

00:20:56.259 --> 00:21:01.939
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became

00:21:01.939 --> 00:21:03.199
poor, why?

00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:07.899
So that we through his poverty might be rich.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:13.379
He left the throne room of heaven, he left the glory, he is eternal God and he left the

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:18.299
throne room of heaven so that he could complete this transaction.

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:22.059
The book of Hebrews, turn there if you will, we'll look at a few verses of scripture, actually

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:26.079
several verses, beginning in Hebrews 8 and then we'll look more extensively at Hebrews

00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:30.479
chapter 9, but I want you to look here in Hebrews.

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:36.599
We have this book and God gives us the book of Hebrews to show to us that Christ is better,

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:37.879
he's superior.

00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:39.919
You say he's better than what?

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:40.919
Everything.

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:41.919
Everything.

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:44.639
Better than the angels, that's how it starts.

00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:49.559
Better than Moses, better than, he just goes through, he's superior.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:55.259
We come to chapter number 8 and we're dealing in this section of the book of his superiority

00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:56.979
over the priesthood.

00:21:56.979 --> 00:22:01.259
We could talk about the Aaronic priesthood in the Old Testament, we could look at the

00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:08.059
fact that Christ, of course his priesthood is not through the Aaronic or Levitical priesthood,

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:12.939
it's through Melchizedek which is spoken of and we won't get into all of that, but I want

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:19.219
you to notice that he is, our Lord Jesus Christ is prophet, priest and king.

00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:23.559
Notice what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 8 in verse number 3.

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:29.279
The Bible says this, for every high priest, remember earlier in the book, for we have

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:33.359
not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, he is

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:37.039
my high priest, praise the Lord.

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:40.999
And we find that the Bible says that every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:48.939
sacrifices, wherefore it is of, notice this word, necessity, that this man have somewhat

00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:51.399
also to offer.

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:55.539
So if the high priest in the Old Testament, the Aaronic, the Levitical priesthood, if

00:22:55.539 --> 00:23:02.019
they had offerings and sacrifices they bring, the question is this, what is it that Jesus,

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:06.899
our great high priest, what offering would he bring because it's absolutely essential,

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:09.939
it's necessary that he would have something to offer.

00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:15.179
Skip to chapter 9, if you will, and begin reading with me in verse number 11.

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:19.879
The Bible says in Hebrews 9 in verse number 11, but Christ, being come a high priest of

00:23:19.879 --> 00:23:26.039
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:31.839
is to say not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, notice, but

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:37.879
by his own blood, he entered in, what's the Bible say, once.

00:23:37.879 --> 00:23:45.699
He entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:46.699
What was the offering?

00:23:46.699 --> 00:23:47.699
What was the sacrifice?

00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:51.319
Well he offered himself and he offered his blood, and the Bible tells us that he did

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.279
it one time and it was settled.

00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:58.039
And what a blessing because we understand, and even if you were to read the 10th chapter,

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:01.519
we won't have time this morning, but if you were to read Hebrews chapter number 10 that

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:06.879
those priests, they ministered daily, they offered sacrifices daily, the day of atonement

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:11.379
was repeated annually, and they brought those offerings, and by the way, the high priest

00:24:11.379 --> 00:24:15.839
had to bring an offering first for himself and then for the nation.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:21.599
Jesus has no sin, so he only had to bring one offering, one sacrifice, and that was

00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:25.159
for the sin of humanity.

00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:28.959
Continue reading in verse number 13, for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes

00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:33.799
of, and heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify it through the purifying of the flesh.

00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:38.359
How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:46.359
without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:52.319
And for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:56.719
the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which

00:24:56.719 --> 00:25:01.479
are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:07.079
For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator,

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:11.159
for a testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength at all

00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:13.359
while the testator liveth.

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:18.359
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood, for when Moses had

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:22.959
spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:28.199
of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people,

00:25:28.199 --> 00:25:32.359
saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:36.799
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry,

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:39.399
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood.

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:43.399
And then notice, and without shedding of blood is no remission.

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:45.719
Aren't you thankful that Christ shed his blood?

00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:48.239
Because without the shedding of blood there's no remission.

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:54.679
Verse 23, it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should

00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:59.559
be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.559
these.

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.559
What's the better sacrifice?

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:03.519
Well, it's his own blood.

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:06.039
It's the sacrifice that Christ made when he went to that cross.

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:10.799
Verse 24, for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:17.079
figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:23.399
Nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest enters into the holy place

00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:25.719
every year with blood of others.

00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:29.839
Listen, he didn't have to offer, it was once for all.

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:32.839
Once for all, oh sinner, believe it.

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:36.759
Listen, in chapter 10 the Bible says in verse number 12, this man after he had offered one

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:41.639
sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of God.

00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:50.959
He says, it was not to be done often, repeatedly, regularly, no, my savior, if you're saved

00:26:50.959 --> 00:26:55.239
this morning, your savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, he went to that cross

00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:59.199
one time and he shed his blood.

00:26:59.199 --> 00:27:01.159
He hath made him to be sin for us.

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:07.699
He bore the sin of the world once for all.

00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:14.319
He went to that borrowed tomb and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave, proving

00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:18.839
that the substitutionary atonement was satisfactory to God.

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:21.439
It satisfied the demands.

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:25.879
Jesus died that horrific death because it was necessary.

00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:31.359
The basis of the transaction was the fact that we're sinners and we're separated from

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.359
God and we're at enmity with God.

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:41.479
There's this variance between two parties and God did nothing wrong but we are the sinners.

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:47.999
And so God comes in his grace, remember, for God so loved the world that he gave God in

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:55.399
his love and his grace, he comes and he does for us what we could never do for ourselves.

00:27:55.399 --> 00:28:00.039
We find that as we continue reading in verse 26, it says, for then must he often have suffered

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:02.039
since the foundation of the world.

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:06.279
But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:07.279
of himself.

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:13.799
Notice that phrase, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:17.839
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.

00:28:17.839 --> 00:28:20.679
Can I tell you this morning, if you don't know the sound of my voice, whether you're

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:24.799
here physically or you're tuned in via live stream, you're going to die one day.

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.919
The Bible says after this, the judgment.

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:30.119
Oh, I'm going to die and I'm just going to cease to exist.

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:31.119
Everything's going to be over.

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:35.799
No, no, the Bible says there's going to be a judgment.

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:40.639
As it's appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

00:28:40.639 --> 00:28:46.880
I said earlier in the message this morning that once we die, it's too late.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.839
For that great white throne judgment, the one that's for the lost people, you take your

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:57.519
final breath here on earth, you can't change that destination.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:29:03.320
For the saved people, that Bema Seat, living to please Jesus, we focused on it twice in

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.399
the second Corinthians chapter five in a single chapter.

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:10.159
You're not going to attend one more church service, you're not going to tell one more

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:14.079
person about Jesus, you're not going to give one more dollar to help a missionary, you're

00:29:14.079 --> 00:29:15.079
not going to...

00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:18.079
We're going to praise him for all of eternity.

00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:22.079
But that spiritual gift that he's equipped you with, the opportunities to minister and

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:26.359
to serve God, those things are all over.

00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:27.359
The time is short.

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:31.399
As it's appointed unto man once to die, after this, the judgment.

00:29:31.399 --> 00:29:39.559
So then notice verse 28, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto

00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:46.079
them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:48.839
I hope you're looking for him.

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:52.479
You know, I begin to think about this truth as I look at this passage of scripture.

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:55.320
We're going to read some more scripture here in just a moment, but I'm going to think about

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.320
that.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.119
You know, not that any of us will ever reach a place of sinless perfection here on this

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:00.440
earth.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.180
It's impossible, okay?

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.120
We have this flesh, we understand that we're to mortify our members, we're to put off

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.440
the old, put on the new, we understand that we're to walk in the Spirit so that we do

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.760
not fulfill the lust of the flesh, but the reality is that our flesh is not eradicated

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.440
at the moment of salvation.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.960
Paul, he says, the things that I would, I do not, the things that I would not, that

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.960
I do.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.920
I mean, he's in this constant struggle, and we understand what it is, but who shall

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.360
deliver me from the body of this death?

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.960
I thank God, right, and he's thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ, but thanks be to God

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.840
what giveth us the victory, he says later in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.840
But I want you to understand as we look here at this text of Scripture in verse 28, so

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.000
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look for Him shall

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.080
He appear the second time without sin and salvation.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.960
I wonder if you're looking for Jesus, looking for Him to appear.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.400
You know who I find, those that would be looking for Jesus, those that are living a life that's

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.560
pleasing to God.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.960
Listen, if you know that you're living a life that's not pleasing to God, you're not anxious

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.480
for Jesus to come back.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.639
Am I right?

00:31:05.639 --> 00:31:09.319
If you know that you're living a sinful life, if you know you're doing things that you ought

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:15.000
not be doing, you're not fully surrendered, you're not sacrificing and surrendering and

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.420
yielding, you're not honoring God, that in all things, all things means all things, He

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.920
might have the preeminence.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.360
Oh, but I have to worry about, oh, I have to worry about, you just start filling in

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.600
the blank of all the things that people are putting in front of God today.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.200
I'm not just talking about lost people, I'm talking about saved people, put in front of

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
God today.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.760
All of a sudden, you're not so anxious for Christ to appear.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760
Why?

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.200
Well, John uses this little phrase at the end of John chapter number two that we would

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.840
be ashamed at Him at His appearing.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.840
You ever get caught with your hand in the cookie jar?

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.200
I know it's an expression that we use sometimes.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.600
Mom said, don't eat the cookies and she leaves the room and you're going to eat the cookie

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:03.040
and she walks back in and you got caught, red-handed, we'll use that terminology sometimes.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.119
Listen, Jesus could come back at any moment if you're looking for Him.

00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:11.800
I wonder this morning, what's the kind of person that's looking for Jesus?

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.600
Well, the kind of person that's living for Jesus, amen?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.440
I mean, listen, if you're not where you're supposed to be, if you're not where you're

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.119
supposed to be, you're probably not looking for Jesus, right?

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:28.479
Because you know you're not where you're supposed to be.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:33.160
And so if Jesus came back when you were not where you're supposed to be, you're going

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.160
to be ashamed.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.559
Am I right?

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.559
Come on.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:40.639
So what do we got to do?

00:32:40.639 --> 00:32:43.400
We got to change our priorities.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.600
That song that they sang, I'm going to follow Him, right?

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.839
Following Jesus is different than following the world.

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:51.839
Come on.

00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:54.800
Following Jesus is different than following the world.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.119
Surrendering all, nothing I'm going to withhold.

00:32:58.119 --> 00:32:59.520
Means I got to let some things go.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.160
There's some things I can't do.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160
Means I got to…

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.839
They're just decisions that we make.

00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:10.400
But we see the transaction was completed when Christ went to the cross.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.600
He bled and He died.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.400
Look at 1 Peter chapter 2, if you will.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.000
1 Peter chapter 2, I want to begin reading in verse 21.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.600
The basis of the transaction, it was necessary.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.720
How was it completed?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:31.720
Notice in 1 Peter, notice how Peter references this and what a joy to think about Peter,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:38.279
all that transpired in his life in these moments leading up to the cross.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:43.320
The arrest and all that Christ suffered and all that Peter dealt with and now God would

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.400
use him to write these words.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.279
Man, it's so, so encouraging.

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:53.720
Bible says in verse 21 of 1 Peter chapter 2, for even unto, excuse me, for even here

00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:00.839
unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that you should

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:02.320
follow His steps.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:09.540
Notice this, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.080
Remember our verse this morning, 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21, for he hath made him to be sin

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:19.480
for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.000
And here it says, who did no sin, listen, he's the perfect sinless lamb of God.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.720
He knew no sin, he did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth, verse 23, who when

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.679
he was reviled, reviled not again.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.040
When he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:44.880
To his own self bear our sins and his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.839
should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes ye were healed.

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:56.440
For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the shepherd and bishop of

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440
your souls.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.480
Listen, I was going my own way.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.640
Sometimes you ever hear somebody say, I found Jesus, Jesus found me, amen.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:14.279
I wasn't looking for Jesus, Jesus found me, I was going my own way.

00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:21.279
I was lost and so were you, Jesus found us.

00:35:21.279 --> 00:35:25.519
The Bible says that we were as sheep going astray, but now are returned to the shepherd

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:26.519
and bishop of your souls.

00:35:26.519 --> 00:35:33.080
And you think about this and understand that he bore his own self, he also bear our sins

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.559
in his own body on the tree.

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:40.239
Your sin, my sin.

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:42.720
He took it willingly, why?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.000
Because sin has to be paid for.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.679
Sin must be paid for and you can't pay for your own sin, absolutely impossible.

00:35:54.679 --> 00:36:00.720
It's only the blood of Christ, the sinless lamb of God that took your place and my place

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.279
so that we could be saved.

00:36:02.279 --> 00:36:03.920
It's wonderful.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.799
You see here in first Peter, turn over to chapter three, if you will, maybe on the same

00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:14.160
page for you in verse 18, the Bible says, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:20.000
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
and quickened by the spirit.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.880
You see where it says that he might bring us to God, that truth of reconciliation.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.640
We were at variance, we were separated from God because of my sin, I was on my way to

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640
a lake of fire.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.640
And so were you.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.040
This truth of 2 Corinthians 5.21 is so important for us as God's people that we understand

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.119
the basis of the transaction.

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.040
Why did Christ have to die?

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.720
Why did he take upon my sin?

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.880
Because there's no other way.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.720
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.679
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:59.119
That sin that entered the world in Genesis chapter number three has affected every human

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:03.839
being that's ever lived upon planet earth outside of Jesus Christ because he was virgin

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.559
born.

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:10.679
We find this morning the basis of the transaction.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:15.679
Number two this morning we see this, I want you to consider the blessings of the transaction.

00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:21.640
Listen, if you're saved this morning, you are blessed beyond measure.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:28.000
If we don't have anything other than the fact that we're saved, we're blessed.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.239
But shall it profit a man that gain the whole world but lose his own soul?

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.959
Is that not what Jesus asked?

00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:40.880
God saved us.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.080
If you're saved this morning, you're going to heaven.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.040
But he also daily loatheth us with benefits.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.200
It's overwhelming to think about how good God has been to us.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.959
I want you to consider the blessings of this transaction and we could sum it up in one

00:37:55.959 --> 00:37:59.799
statement, it's the imputed righteousness of God.

00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:05.640
The word impute means to set to the account of, it carries with it this idea, to reckon

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.799
to one what does not belong to him.

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:17.600
Can I tell you that Christ's righteousness didn't belong to me, but he imputed it to

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600
me.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.799
That's pretty awesome.

00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:25.880
The imputed righteousness, I didn't deserve it, you didn't deserve it, but God loved

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:27.799
us so much.

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:30.239
We're going to think about the blessings of this transaction.

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:34.840
The Bible says, he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.479
the righteousness of God in him.

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:44.919
Listen, when I stand in the presence of God, it's not based upon my own righteousness,

00:38:44.919 --> 00:38:50.080
it's based upon the fact that I am clothed with the righteousness of God, that the Lord

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:57.000
Jesus Christ took my sin and in exchange he gave me his righteousness.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.280
It's absolutely amazing to consider.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.039
What did I have to offer God?

00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:04.440
Nothing.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.320
Sometimes we think that we have something to offer God.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.479
We have nothing to offer him.

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:15.039
The Bible says in Isaiah 64 that all of our good works are as filthy rags, and he took

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:17.960
all of that wickedness, he took all of that sin.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.599
You say, I really wasn't that bad, really.

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:23.599
I didn't murder anybody.

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:27.159
I have people tell me that all the time.

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:32.919
Then we have people that think, well, you know, we start putting these levels on sin.

00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:36.679
It's okay for me to miss this or not do that or avoid doing this.

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:41.919
You know, listen, sin is sin.

00:39:41.919 --> 00:39:43.440
Sin is sin.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:52.640
You read the list of the things that God hates, lying is in there twice out of seven.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.320
Right?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.960
Lying is in there twice.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.080
People don't think lying is that bad.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:11.040
know what Paul says in Ephesians 4? Stop lying. Speak the truth. That's what he says. We're

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:19.920
vile, wicked, have nothing to offer God. And God says, I'll take all of that and I'll give

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:28.160
you my righteousness. It just, humanly speaking, it doesn't make sense. If you want to make

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.340
a trade with someone, you're going to make an exchange, you're going to make a transaction

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.520
with someone. You're trying to get the most for your money, so to speak. I'm going to

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.440
try to make a fair transaction. I want to give you something that's of equal value and

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.240
maybe I'm going to get something that's of slightly greater value. We have nothing to

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:54.600
offer God. And he gave us his righteousness. I hope this morning we never get over that.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.880
But we acknowledge this morning that we're sinners saved by grace. And now because I'm

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.600
a sinner saved by grace, I'm joined heirs with Christ. I'm a child of the King. Hallelujah.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:10.960
Heaven is my home. Praise God. The Bible says this over in Romans chapter 4. Look there

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.600
if you will. Read a few more verses of scriptures. We deal with this blessing, considering the

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:23.200
blessing of this transaction that was completed. In Romans chapter 4, begin reading with me

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:30.160
in verse number 8. The Bible says this. Romans chapter 4, beginning in verse number 1. What

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:38.200
shall we say then that Abraham our father's pertaining to the flesh hath found? For if

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:44.480
Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. Romans 4 and

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:51.120
verse 2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.120
God. See Ephesians 2 says that for by grace you're saved through faith and not of yourselves.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.760
It's the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. If we get to heaven by our

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:06.880
works, then we stand before the God's throne and say we earned it. We earned it. But no,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.520
it's an even playing field. It's the ground at the cross is all level. None of us can

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.920
earn through our works salvation. And so he says that if Abraham were justified by works,

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.240
he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. Notice verse 3. For what saith the Scripture?

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:29.800
Isn't that always a good question to ask? Appeal to the Scripture. What does God say?

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.920
What's your opinion? What does God say? What saith the Scripture? I love it. What does

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.560
God say? Not what does your culture say, not what does the religion say, what does the

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.960
leader of some denomination say? No, what does God say? What does the Scripture say?

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.240
Notice the Bible says this, Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.920
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. God's not

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.640
going to owe us anything. God doesn't owe us anything. It's his grace and his mercy.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.560
It says in verse number 5, but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:14.320
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also described it, the blessedness

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:20.040
of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works. You see the word, we talked

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.160
about the imputed righteousness of God. And he says this, it's without works. Saying blessed

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.360
are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.640
to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Man, I'm so thankful this morning. While I'm trying

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:40.520
to be a good person to get to heaven, how much good do you have to do? How do you ever

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.240
know if you've done enough? You understand what I'm saying? There's a world out there

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:53.540
that's living with that kind of thinking. In fact, there are people all across our region

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:59.000
today that are probably sitting in a church somewhere that have that belief. I just got

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.840
to be good enough. And by being in church today is one of those good enough things.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.280
Doesn't matter what they did last night, doesn't matter what they're going to do this week,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:16.960
it's just they were in church today. Listen, God, He imputeth His righteousness on my account,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.280
on your account, if you're saved this morning, without works. Without works. Notice if you

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.820
will, skip down to verse number 16. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.400
to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.680
of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.460
us all. If we notice here what he says in Romans about Abraham and understanding this

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.480
truth of imputed righteousness, turn to the book of Galatians, if you will, and chapter

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:53.540
number 3, and we'll note just a statement that is made again here about Abraham and

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:59.320
about this righteousness, because the reality is that Paul is going to make a great truth

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.480
in Philippians that we're going to get to in just a moment with regard to understanding

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.200
these biblical foundational truths that go all the way back to Genesis with regard to

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:13.880
Abraham. In Galatians chapter number 3 and verse number 6, the Bible says, even as Abraham

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:21.840
believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. I want you to skip down and

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.840
look at verse number 21, if you will. The Bible says, is the law then against the promises

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:33.080
of God? God forbid. Then notice this truth, for if there had been a law given which could

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:41.600
have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But there was not a

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.800
law that could give life. The law cannot give life. The law, as we noticed earlier in the

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.000
book of 2 Corinthians, as we've studied and looked through this book and studied verse

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.680
by verse, we find that it was in chapter number 3 that there was that great contrast

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:08.120
between the law and grace. What does the law do? It kills. It condemns. And we find that

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:15.120
here Paul is saying, listen, Abraham was, he believed God and it was accounted to him

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.760
for righteousness. The law, it cannot give us righteousness. And then Paul says this,

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.640
and I know I'm kind of going backwards, but at the end of chapter 2 he says, I do not

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:32.200
frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.160
So what is Paul saying? Now remember the verse that we're looking at this morning, 2 Corinthians

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.760
5 verse 21, as we finish this great chapter in 2 Corinthians 5, the Bible says, for he

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.900
hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.220
of God in him. You say, but I'm going to keep the law and I'm going to become righteous.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.660
No, righteousness cannot come by the law. And if it could, then Christ is dead in vain.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.580
And if you believe that righteousness can come by the law, you've got bigger theology

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:08.740
problems because why did Christ die? Can I tell you this morning, my Savior, God in flesh,

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:20.220
he did not die in vain. He did not die in vain. He died to redeem us. To take that,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:30.020
what we've referred to here as the great transaction, this exchange of my filthy rags, my sin, for

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:35.260
his righteousness. It's amazing. Notice what Paul says, Philippians chapter 3, and we'll

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:52.340
finish with this. As Paul gives his own testimony to the church here in Philippi. In Philippians

00:47:52.340 --> 00:48:00.300
chapter 3, Paul had, we're going to start reading verse number 4. At the end of verse

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.020
number 3, it says, we have no confidence in the flesh. And notice what he begins to say.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.180
He says, though, verse number 4, Philippians 3, though I might also have confidence in

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.740
the flesh. Now, he's just said, I have no confidence in the flesh, but he's beginning

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:21.940
to give an illustration to these people for them to understand that righteousness is not

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:29.020
something we can produce on our own. So, he says this, though I might also have confidence

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.500
in the flesh, if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.460
I more. And he begins to give his pedigree, if you will, circumcise the eighth day, the

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.380
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.420
law of Pharisee. Concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.540
is in the law, blameless. But what things were gained to me, those I counted lost for

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.260
Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things, but lost for the excellency of the knowledge

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.500
of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.980
but dung, that I may win Christ, and then notice what he says in verse nine, and be

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:11.299
found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through

00:49:11.299 --> 00:49:19.619
the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Paul says, you can try

00:49:19.619 --> 00:49:23.260
to keep the law. I've had people, I shared this a few weeks ago, I had somebody that

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:29.820
was telling me that they keep, we keep the law. I've known this individual for a number

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:34.780
of years, and part of keeping the law, they believe, and they're trying to do, is keeping

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:42.100
the Sabbath. And for as many years as I've known them, they've broken the Sabbath. But

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:49.460
yet they're saying they're keeping the law. They're blinded. Remember 2 Corinthians 4?

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:55.020
In whom the God of this world hath blinded. Why? Why is he blinding their minds? Lest

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.020
the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto them. He wants to keep them lost.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.180
He wants people to think they can be good enough

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.340
to get to heaven.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.520
He wants people to think that they can have

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.840
enough good works to produce some level of righteousness.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.620
James will later say that if you offend in one point,

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.140
you're guilty of all.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.780
And we find here this morning that Paul says,

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.860
I want to be clothed,

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.900
I want to have the righteousness of Christ.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.580
I'm not interested in trying to,

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.380
remember he already said in Galatians that we can't,

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.180
righteousness doesn't come by the law,

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.620
but there are people that are trying to do that.

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.860
You know people, I know people that are trying

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.660
to earn God's favor by some level of keeping the law

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.520
or doing some outward thing.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.200
But 2 Corinthians 5.21 settles all of it.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.600
Because the only way to get the righteousness of God

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.880
is to accept the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal savior,

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.380
recognizing that he took your sin

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.380
and he offers you his righteousness.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.140
And so the question this morning really kind of boils down

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.260
to all of that to say this.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.620
Have you experienced the great transaction?

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.260
Have you given, received, I should say,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.100
have you received the righteousness of God

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.580
in exchange for your sin?

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.200
He paid for it.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.020
He paid for your sin.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.320
He said this on the cross of Calvary, it is finished.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.040
Paid in full, done, complete.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.580
But for some reason, I talk to people so often,

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.840
that they think there's gotta be something I gotta do.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.220
There's gotta be something I gotta do.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.260
And they're not willing to turn to repent

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:38.260
and turn from that false teaching and trust Christ alone.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.340
Can I tell you this morning

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.120
that salvation is not grace plus works?

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.900
That's not salvation.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.380
Salvation is not works.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.200
Salvation is not grace plus works.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.040
Salvation is Christ alone.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.340
And he offers this to us.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.940
If you've received it this morning,

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.900
if you've experienced this great transaction,

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.140
if you've been born again this morning,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.240
I wonder this morning,

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.120
how much of an impact has it made in your life?

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.020
Are you a new creature?

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.180
You living for Jesus?

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.460
Recognizing you're gonna stand before him one day?

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.200
Are you living so that in all things,

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.580
he might have the preeminence?

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.540
Are you living in a life of surrender

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.920
as the lady sang about this morning?

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.940
But then what about those,

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.220
maybe someone's here this morning,

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.240
that they've never experienced this transaction?

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.580
They don't know that they're saved.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.860
They don't know that they're forgiven.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.740
Maybe they're trying,

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.620
they've tried to follow some religious creed,

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.940
some rote religion of do this and do that and go over.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.460
No, listen, Christ did it all.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.780
And the wonderful truth of God's word,

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.060
we talk about the imputed righteousness of Christ.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.860
For he hath made him to be sin for us,

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.860
who knew no sin,

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.860
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.980
I stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.900
Amen.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.500
I stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.500
And I wonder this morning,

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.420
listen, when we truly understand this message,

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.580
this is the message that we sang this morning,

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.160
send the light, the blessed gospel light.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.000
Why?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.360
Because we have a message that is so important.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.040
We have a message that's so glorious.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.240
We can't ever get over it.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.760
Oh, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.600
So I'm gonna start doing this and doing this.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.960
And I'm gonna fill my schedule with this.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.800
And I'm not gonna honor the Lord over here

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.700
because I'm going to heaven.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.200
Listen, you've missed the point

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.400
because I'm gonna stand before him one day.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.720
I'm not gonna lose my salvation.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.600
You could never lose it.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.440
It's eternal.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.380
But oh, you can live in such a way

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:54.140
that you don't have God's favor on your life.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.820
And I want God's favor on my life.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.140
The great transaction.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.420
Have you been saved this morning?

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.240
Have you been born again?

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.940
If so, would you rejoice in it?

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.540
Would you thank God for the blessings of knowing

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.980
that he took all of your sin,

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.180
he removed them as far as the east is from the west.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.580
The Bible says that he's not gonna remember them anymore.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.020
They're buried in the deepest sea.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.860
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.580
Glory.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.300
Would you tell somebody about Jesus?

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.720
Because we are his ambassadors.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.180
It's in the same text.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.020
We're his ambassadors.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.260
Will you tell someone about Jesus?

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.380
If you're not saved this morning,

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.980
the very next text in 2 Corinthians 6,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.980
Paul says today is the day of salvation.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.800
Listen, do not delay.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.640
You don't know what's gonna,

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.260
I'll do that later, I'll do that after.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.160
Listen, you don't know what's gonna happen this afternoon.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.420
Today is the day of salvation.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.260
Let us pray.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.080
Father, we love you.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:48.920
Thank you for loving us.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.960
Thank you for the truth of the gospel.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.160
Thank you for the power of the gospel.

00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:00.160
We thank you this morning that Jesus saves.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.640
As we consider this great transaction,

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.800
you took all my sin and you offer to me your righteousness.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.080
Thank you, thank you, Lord.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.460
Help me never to get over my salvation.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.760
Then God, I pray that you would help me

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.240
to be faithful to tell others

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.840
of this wonderful, glorious truth that Jesus saves.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.520
Would you move in hearts and lives as only you can?

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.300
I pray, God, that if there's one not saved,

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.660
that today, this very moment,

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.720
would be the day of their salvation.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.280
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.520
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.360
Would you stand with me?

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.980
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.520
Holly's gonna play quietly on the piano,

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.480
and as she does, the altar's open.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.320
If you're not sure if,
