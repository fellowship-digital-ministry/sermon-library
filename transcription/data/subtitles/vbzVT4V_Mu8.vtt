00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
is next month, the month of March, 1 Timothy 3.15.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.719
It is longer than the last two verses, all right?

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.560
1 Timothy 3.15 is longer than the month of January,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.960
the month of February.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.079
And so you need to begin right away working on that one.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.680
And so therefore, if you already got the February one down,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.260
well, you have an extra day to begin working

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.520
on the March one, amen?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.719
And so we can look at it from both perspectives.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.760
1 Thessalonians this evening, 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.239
we're gonna be looking at verse number 16 again.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.479
As we've gone through this portion of scripture,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:38.000
we found that the instruction provided to this local church

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.240
and then of course, preserve for all of the church age

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.000
so that every local church has the instruction,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.959
is concise, it's clear, it's applicable.

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:50.680
And we find that with each of these pieces of instruction

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.659
that God has given us, that it requires action.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.240
There's something for us to do.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.119
There's some response when we look at this instruction.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.400
And so this evening,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.159
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.639
let me say this, as the people of God,

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:08.919
we have been saved from our sins, amen?

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:12.239
We find that the Bible tells us and we experience it

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.000
that daily we are loaded with benefits.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.319
And one day, one day we're gonna go to heaven

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.080
and we're gonna spend eternity with our savior.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.040
Now with that, just those three thoughts this evening,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.720
we as the people of God, as saved people,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.000
we should be a rejoicing people, amen?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.199
It ought to be the case that we are known for being joyful,

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.879
for being rejoiceful people, individuals.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:41.639
The Lord wants his people to live different.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:42.599
Why?

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.400
Because we are different.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.919
We're different.

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:47.239
And he wants us to live different.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.540
You know, it's easy for just about anybody to complain.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.319
Your flesh and my flesh,

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.480
you know what our flesh wants to do?

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:56.879
It wants to murmur and it wants to complain.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.519
How often we see in the Old Testament,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.959
the children of Israel guilty of murmuring.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.959
And over and over, they're eating miraculous provision,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.880
manna that God has miraculously provided for them.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.039
And I mean, when you look and you understand

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.679
what God tells us about how he sent the manna

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.800
and understanding the provision and just what a blessing,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960
and yet they're complaining,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.759
they're murmuring about the provision of God.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.639
You know, it's easy for us to complain.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.399
It's easy for us to murmur.

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.000
And that's what our flesh wants to do.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080
But the reality is as God's people, as Christians,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.119
we have crucified the flesh,

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.360
or at least we should have crucified the flesh.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.080
Every day, by the way, it's not a one and done.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.679
Every day, sometimes multiple times in the day,

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:49.080
you have to say, hey, old man, you're dead.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.520
I am crucified with Christ.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.320
And we, as understanding with the Apostle Paul,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.479
he says, I die daily.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.600
He talks about in the book of Ephesians,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.080
and again, in the book of Colossians,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.559
the put off and put on principle, if you will,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.279
and we're to put off the old man

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.639
and the ways of the old man.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.080
We're to put on the new man

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.960
and we're to walk in the spirit.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.600
And so we find here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 16,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.800
the Bible says, rejoice evermore.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.240
Rejoice evermore.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.639
It's one word in the Greek.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.199
It's the shortest verse in all of the New Testament.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.360
We find that often we look at the letters

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.000
or the number of letters in John 11, 35, Jesus wept.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.919
In our English Bibles,

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.520
that would be the shortest verse number of letters

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.960
in those two words versus these two words.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.479
But this is one word in the Greek, rejoice evermore.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.199
It literally carries with it the idea

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.479
of to rejoice at all times.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.000
At all times, rejoice.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.479
Remember what the Psalmist said in Psalm 118 and verse 24.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.240
This is the day the Lord hath made.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.919
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.440
And really that's a decision that is made, is it not?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.080
The Psalmist says, he didn't say,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.279
this is the day the Lord has made.

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.479
We're gonna see how things go

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.639
and we're gonna determine

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.119
whether we're gonna rejoice or murmur,

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.800
whether we're gonna complain or give thanks.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.520
No, he said, this is the day the Lord hath made.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.520
We will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.119
Philippians four and verse number four,

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:20.679
the Bible says rejoice in the Lord always.

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:24.239
And again, I say rejoice.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.959
Really the theme of the book of Philippians is joy.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.679
And Paul is writing from prison

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:31.000
and Paul is a man who is rejoicing

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.799
and understanding that God is in control

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:35.839
and that God has him where he needs to be

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.040
at that particular time.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.160
And we find that Paul is encouraging these believers

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.679
in Philippi to rejoice, to be joyful.

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:45.600
It's very interesting to me as I would consider

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.119
the entirety of the thought of the book of Philippians

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:51.920
and understanding where things began in Philippi

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.959
when Paul and Silas went there on a missionary journey

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.359
and they preached the gospel.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:58.600
And then of course they were beaten and imprisoned.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.119
And remember when they were in prison at midnight,

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:02.359
what were they doing?

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:03.359
They were rejoicing.

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:05.679
They were singing and praising the Lord.

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.760
And that Philippian jailer, he said,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.160
sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.040
And he was gloriously saved by the grace of God.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.480
He was baptized.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.040
And we find that that man, I believe,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.559
was part of the church at Philippi.

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.320
And I think about this man, this Philippian jailer

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.119
that's now saved and serving the Lord.

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.679
You think about when he receives this message,

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.399
this letter, the letter that we call

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:31.480
the book of Philippians.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.119
And when he would read that and when he'd hear it read

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.160
and he'd hear about this thing of rejoicing,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.660
he could understand that, you know what?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.839
In the darkest of hours for Paul, he was rejoicing.

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:45.480
That's impactful, by the way.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.000
It's not that Paul was just saying,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.399
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.600
because God would use him to pen the scripture to rejoice,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.160
but he was a man that was rejoicing.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.320
He had joy.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.640
I think about what Peter says.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.480
Look at, if you will, in 1 Peter chapter one.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.760
And we'll share some thoughts with you this evening.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.420
1 Peter chapter number one.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.079
1 Peter chapter one.

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:08.160
Look at verse number six, if you will.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.160
1 Peter one and verse number six.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.440
The Bible says, wherein ye greatly rejoice,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.880
though now for a season, if need be,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.079
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:28.140
Notice that the trial of your faith.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.359
Look at how we should view the trial of our faith

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:35.359
being, look, much more precious than of gold

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:38.119
that perisheth, though it be tried with fire.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.600
There might be found unto praise and honor and glory

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.359
at the appearing of Jesus Christ,

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:45.320
whom having not seen ye love,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.160
in whom though now ye see him not yet believing,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.920
ye rejoice, notice what it says,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.480
with joy unspeakable and full of glory,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.940
receiving the end of your faith,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.559
even the salvation of your souls.

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.000
And we find that these that are being written to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.040
in the book of 1 Peter,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.079
they're dealing with great adversity and opposition.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.000
Thus, Peter says that, if need be,

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:12.559
you're in this time of heaviness and trial and difficulty,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.399
but yet we rejoice, rejoice.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.440
And so the challenge from 1 Thessalonians five

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.899
and verse number 16 this evening,

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:23.679
the instruction is rejoice evermore.

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:25.880
Let's consider three reasons

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.459
God's people should rejoice evermore.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.359
Now the reality is I'm trying to teach this

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:32.200
in about 25 or 30 minutes this evening,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.720
but we could have a whole series on rejoice evermore.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.279
I mean, we could spend weeks and weeks and weeks

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.720
and message after message after message

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720
on why it is that God's people should rejoice evermore.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.559
I've tried to consolidate it this evening

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.940
into three thoughts that you can take home with you

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.679
and you can muse upon them.

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.399
And in just a short period of time on Wednesday evening,

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.079
as we give time for prayer,

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:58.040
that we could take these things and we could say,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.820
you know what, I should be rejoicing at all times,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.000
and I can be with the help of God

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.480
and understanding these truths,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.440
I can rejoice at all times, rejoice evermore.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.839
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.440
why should we rejoice evermore?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.019
Well, number one, because God has all power,

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:18.640
because God has all power.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.600
Remember what Jesus said

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.679
when he gives the Great Commission

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:22.040
in Matthew 28 and verse 18,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.299
he said, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:30.000
I think about many times in which God reveals to his people

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.479
his power, we can look at it in the Old Testament,

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.780
we can look at the New Testament,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.380
we can find that God declares on a multitude of times

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.419
that he has all power.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.299
Not only does he declare he has all power,

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.059
but I love the truth that he demonstrates

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:47.380
that he has all power.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.640
It's certainly valid for God Almighty,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.739
the creator of the universe,

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:55.159
to claim that he has all power,

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:58.539
to declare to us, to explain to us that he has all power,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.619
but then he's given us the Bible

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:04.419
and he's recorded for us a number of examples

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.900
in which he demonstrated that he has all power.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.460
And that's encouraging to me,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.140
and it should be encouraging to you,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.460
it should cause us to rejoice evermore, why?

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.580
Because whatever you're facing at this hour,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.619
at this moment in your life, God has all power.

00:09:18.619 --> 00:09:20.859
And you look at circumstance and you look at situations,

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:22.080
hey, well, this is, I mean,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.900
look at all of this that is against me.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.780
Remember what the Bible says in the book of Romans,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.179
if God be for us, who can be against us?

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:30.840
And we understand that he has all power,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.400
understand with me this evening

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.479
that he has power over the enemy.

00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:37.400
You know that you have an enemy and I have an enemy.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.520
He walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.840
The Bible says whom resists steadfast in the faith.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.599
And we understand that we're to be sober,

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:45.880
we're to be vigilant, the Bible says in 1 Peter 5,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.039
in verse number eight, why?

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:48.000
Because we have an enemy,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.239
but I'm thankful that our God has more power.

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:52.359
He has power over the enemy.

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.919
Understand tonight that your enemy

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:56.119
and my enemy is a defeated foe.

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:59.159
He's defeated, he's defeated.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.000
And we find the.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that the Bible tells us in the book of 1 John in chapter number 4,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And yes, we have a foe, we have an enemy,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but God is greater, He has more power than the enemy.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
We find that during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as we're understanding this idea this evening, I should rejoice at all times,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I should rejoice evermore because God has all power.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I think about the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and how during His earthly ministry,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated His power in a number of ways.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You know He demonstrated His power over nature, over nature.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Aren't you thankful? He's the creator.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
No wonder He would have power over nature.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So many people today have these things mixed up about Mother Nature

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and whatever other terms they want to use,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
but understand that God created all things.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He is the creator God. It is by His power that it is,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but also He's the one that keeps it.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
By Him all things consist. Amen?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
He holds it in the power of His hand.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
It's only because of God that things continue as they are.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Without God, you remove God, everything falls apart.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It just unwinds. It's totally nothing.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But we find that God, in all of His power, He has power over nature.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It is God that could stand and say,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
peace, be still, to a great storm.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And immediately, think about the impact that it had on the disciples.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
They said, what matter of man is this that even the winds and waves,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
they obey Him?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
That's the God that we serve.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
He has all power. He has power over nature.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Understand with me this evening, He has power over death.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
He has power over death.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You know, a lot of people are afraid of death.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
A lot of people fear death.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
If you're saved this evening, you should have no fear of death.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We understand the truth of Hebrews chapter number 2,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that we no longer fear death. Why?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Because our Savior conquered death,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and He's delivered us, those who believe,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
from that fear of death.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Listen, before I trusted Christ as my Savior, I feared death.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Why did I fear death before I got saved?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Because I didn't know what was going to happen when I died.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And then it got real serious after I heard the gospel,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and had not trusted Christ as my Savior,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
because I believed what they were telling me was true,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that there was only one way to heaven,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and that if you're a sinner and you're not saved, you're going to go to hell.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And so then I started to think more seriously that if I die,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I'm going to hell, the lake of fire.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And I was fearful.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Hallelujah, He saved me, delivered me from that fear.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I remember every day, leading up for about two weeks

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
before I actually got saved, before I finally got saved,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that I was so afraid of dying.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I was only a teenager. I mean, I was a healthy teenager.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I was active. I mean, I was playing sports and all these types of things,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the most fit in my life I ever have been.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And I find that at that time, every day I was fearing death.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But you know, since that day that I got saved,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I've not feared death.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I mean, I'm not excited about the process of dying,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but I know that God will give me grace.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Amen?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I know that I'll see my Savior face to face.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
He has power. Listen to me this evening.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
He has power over disease.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
You know, what about the examples of the miracles?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I mean, listen, distance was no problem for our God because He's omniscient.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
He simply could speak a word,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and the individual that was diseased could be healed.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We find that there are those that, I think about the woman that came.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
She had an issue of blood for 12 years,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and she said, if I could just touch the hem of his garment.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I mean, she spent all of her living.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
She spent everything she had to get well, to no avail.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But she was made whole.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
She was made whole.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You know, one day, you know what the ultimate healing is of disease?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
When this mortal shall put on immortality.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Sometimes what happens, we don't have the right mindset.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We pray for a loved one.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We pray for someone that's got a sickness on our prayer list,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and we say, why isn't God healing them?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
One day, they're going to be completely healed.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And it's when this mortal shall put on immortality.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It's when this corruption shall put on incorruption, 1 Corinthians 15.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And until that day, we're going to battle with sickness and disease,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
but God does have the power.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Listen, there are times that God demonstrates His power,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and He touches and heals people.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And what a glorious truth that is.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I mean, we rejoice in that, and we thank God for that,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because we know that He's the great physician.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I was praying yesterday, just right here, praying yesterday morning.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
My little nephew, I mean, he's dealing with a serious situation with these seizures.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I mean, it's a bad deal.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And I was praying and asking God, You're the Creator God.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
You have all power.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
If it is Your will, You can touch that little boy and heal him.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And I believe that, because He is the great physician, and He can.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And if He chooses not to, my prayer is that God would give Him grace,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that God would give Him grace.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Listen, He has power over the demons.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You think about the times during the miracles in which the demons,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they understand, they know who Christ is.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
There are people today that debate who Christ is.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Jesus actually asked the disciples, Whom say men that I am?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And He said, Well, some say that you're John the Baptist.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Some say that you're Elijah or one of the other prophets.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
He said, But whom say ye that I am?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And Peter stands up and says, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And we find that the demons, however, they said they knew who He was.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Have you come to torment us before our time?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
They knew who Jesus was.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
They know that He's God.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And we find this evening that our God has all power.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We could go on and on this evening, but again, we don't have the time on a Wednesday evening.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I want you to understand that we should rejoice evermore

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
because our God has all power.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Listen, you don't have all power and I don't have all power,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but He has all power.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And we find that when we go and we go in His power,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
He says that we're to go, He says, after we're filled with the Holy Spirit

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
or we understand the truth of Acts 1-8

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and we have that power to go out and preach the gospel,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
He gives us that power.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But I think about any circumstance, any situation that you're dealing with this evening,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
He has power. He has all power.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And He says, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost part of the earth.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And what a joy and what a blessing it is to know that He would empower us

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
for the task that we have to deal with on a daily basis.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So why should we rejoice evermore?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Again, this is not an exhaustive list this evening.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I've tried to boil it down to three thoughts.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Number one, we should rejoice evermore because God has all power.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Number two this evening, we should rejoice evermore because God has a purpose.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
You know, everything that God does is a purpose.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
As you read the Bible, as you study the Word of God,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
you will see, you will understand that God moves with purpose.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And what a blessing it is to understand that God has a purpose.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Have you ever been in a situation, you've encountered some circumstances,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and maybe somebody was having you do something,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and you're like, what is the point of this?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
What is the purpose of this exercise?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And if you're dealing with an individual, if you're dealing with,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
sometimes, I had a shoulder issue last summer,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and the doctor said, can you do this, can you do that?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
No, I'm here because I can't do that.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And they want you to do all this stuff,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and I understand they were trying to get through and figure out what the issue was,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
but the reality is that God always has a purpose.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
In your situation, in your circumstance this evening,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
we have to understand that God has a purpose.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
There are times in which it's difficult for us to see that or understand that,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
but I want you to rest assured as you study the Word of God,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
as you read through the accounts of Scripture,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
we're going to look at two this evening at the very end,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
very briefly, to just kind of tie the whole thing together.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
But we find tonight that our God always moves with purpose.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Sometimes we find that in the circumstances that we find ourselves in,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
that He purposes to deliver us from whatever it is that we're dealing with.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And by the way, we like it when He delivers us. Amen?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
In fact, when He delivers us,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
it's really kind of easy to rejoice evermore in those times.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
But you know, there are other times in which He desires to develop us,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
that His purpose in a particular situation,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
a particular circumstance is to develop us.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
You know, the process of development is a difficult process.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
The process of growing is a difficult process.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And we find that God at times in your life and in my life,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
He wants to develop us.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And in that time of developing, in the time when we might not be able

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
to fully, clearly understand, we can rest in the truth

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
that God has a purpose in that situation,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and we can rejoice at all times.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We can rejoice evermore.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I would say this, that always God's purpose

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
is that He would be honored and glorified.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You know how we honor and glorify the Lord? By rejoicing evermore.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
By recognizing His hand at work.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
By recognizing that He has a purpose.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Even if I can't see what it is at that very moment,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I can rest in knowing who God is,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
in knowing that He has all power,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
in knowing that He has a purpose.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Let me say this tonight, number three, because God has a plan.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Because God has a plan.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
No doubt you've had plans in your life that have been spoiled.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
You've planned something.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I mean, maybe you've gone through great extent

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
to try to plan a particular trip or vacation

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
or whatever it was that you're trying to plan.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You've had all these things, I mean, you just went all out,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
you had it all ready to go, and then something happens

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
and just kind of destroys the whole plan.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Our God has a plan that no one's going to change.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Why? Because He's God and He has all power.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
He has a purpose.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
See, God's plan is...

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.279
is perfect, God's plan is better than your plan.

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:03.720
You say, well, this wasn't in my plan.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.480
Have you ever heard somebody say that before?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.019
This wasn't in my plans.

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:10.880
But you can rejoice because it was in God's plan.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.279
It might not have been in your plan.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:16.000
No doubt, each of us have dealt with things in our lives

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.760
that said, man, I didn't expect this to happen today.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.719
This isn't how I planned it.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.280
And if you're a planner,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.760
that happens more frequently in your life.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.319
I can relate with you.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:29.399
I am a planner, okay?

00:20:29.399 --> 00:20:32.520
And so when something gets, that wrench gets thrown into it,

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.799
we can get real irritated.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.880
But God has a plan.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.900
You know, I think about his amazing plan of redemption.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.040
I mean, before the foundation of the world,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.919
God determined that he would redeem his creation.

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:50.599
And you know, as you study the Old Testament,

00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:52.619
so often throughout the Old Testament,

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:55.000
as you see various things that take place,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.840
you have to understand that there's a spiritual battle

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.000
that's taking place.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.680
And so many of those events

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.119
that are recorded in the Old Testament

00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:04.760
are attempts by the power of Satan

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.040
to thwart the plan of God,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.199
to deviate what God had intended to do

00:21:11.199 --> 00:21:13.440
by sending forth the Messiah.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.760
And we find that throughout the Old Testament,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.879
if we read it and we understand it and we see,

00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:18.720
but guess what?

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.720
God's plan comes to pass.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.839
Jesus was born, amen?

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:25.879
And you think about all of the attempts

00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:30.080
that led up to just even the line,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.120
as you would think about the Messianic prophecies

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.440
and the line of Messiah

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.839
and all of the attempts that took place throughout history

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:42.400
to try to corrupt that line.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.239
But Jesus came forth, born of a virgin.

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:52.959
After he was born, Herod, he said to the wise men,

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:55.199
he said, well, listen, you find him

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:56.199
and then you tell me where he is

00:21:56.199 --> 00:21:57.440
because I'm gonna come and worship.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.919
And then he has all of the children to and under killed.

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:00.919
Why?

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:02.639
Satan's behind that.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.199
We can talk about Herod

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:08.000
and we can talk about various things about Herod

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.080
and we can look at some of his tendencies

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.160
and so on and so forth,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.919
but we have to understand that there is a spiritual war

00:22:14.919 --> 00:22:16.479
that's taking place.

00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:19.000
And in that spiritual war, what are they trying to do?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.639
What is Satan trying to do?

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:23.960
Well, he's trying to destroy God's plan.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.039
But you know, Jesus went to a cross.

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.679
Oh, but before he got to the cross,

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:31.080
there were times in which people tried to kill him.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.919
Tried to kill him.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:34.839
Why?

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:37.279
So they couldn't go to the cross.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:40.240
But he went to the cross and he went to the cross willingly

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.639
and he completed the plan.

00:22:44.639 --> 00:22:46.199
He was buried in that borrowed tomb

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:48.360
and then he rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.399
What a blessing to understand

00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:52.720
God's amazing plan of redemption.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.919
I think about God having a plan though.

00:22:54.919 --> 00:22:57.759
And yes, we look at God's amazing plan of redemption,

00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:01.160
but to understand that his plan includes us.

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:04.320
For God so loved the world.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.800
Someone said this,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.360
as you understand the truth of God's word,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.160
that he loves me, he loves you as an individual.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.679
Yes, he loves the world

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:16.199
and it's a global all people situation,

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:18.199
but he loves us as individuals.

00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:22.399
And when he died, he was dying for us.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080
His plan included us.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.479
And I'm so thankful.

00:23:26.479 --> 00:23:28.960
Someone said this, if I was the only person to ever live,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960
Jesus would have died for me.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.800
It's true, why?

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.479
Because it's the only way you could be redeemed.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.119
What a glorious truth.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.919
I think about his plan for all ages.

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.199
You know, at times we think about

00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:43.559
what's going on in our world today

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:45.160
and we say, man, things are just going crazy.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.039
Things are falling apart, so on and so forth.

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:49.240
I know I've said it often, things are falling in place.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.320
They're not falling apart.

00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:53.160
And we find that God has a plan.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.360
By the way, God has given us some insight

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.000
to some of what his plan is.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.919
He has revealed to us so often.

00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:01.000
I think Bart and I were talking about this a little while ago

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.559
people say, man, the earth's gonna end at this date.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:05.800
No, listen, we got at least seven years of tribulation,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.720
at least a thousand years of millennium, amen?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.759
So we got a thousand seven years in one day at least.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.839
The globalists, they don't like that idea,

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:16.000
but that's Bible, amen?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.679
It's Bible.

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.079
And so this evening we understand

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:21.760
that God has revealed things to you

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.839
and he's revealed things to me with regard to his plan.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:28.399
And his plan includes us.

00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:32.519
His plan is one that's not going to be deviated from.

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:34.880
It's not going to be overthrown.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.720
And we find that his plan, I think about it for eternity,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.480
that forever we'll be with him, forever.

00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:45.679
Now when we understand these three simple thoughts

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:48.899
this evening and we've added me, if you will,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.980
to that skeletal kind of an outline,

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.100
but when we understand that God has all power,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.799
that he has a purpose in everything that he does

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:57.299
and how he moves and what he does

00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:59.579
and he has a plan for your life and for my life,

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:01.359
and we consider all of those things

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:03.339
with regard to the plan that he has for eternity,

00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:05.940
listen, we ought to rejoice evermore.

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:09.660
You say, but pastor, I had a really bad day.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.359
Did you hear anything that I said?

00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:15.660
Because it's really easy to get caught up in the moment

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.299
and to be facing a situation that seems like

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:23.299
it's just, it's all we can focus on.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.619
But what we need to do is we need to change our focus.

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:29.760
We need to lift our eyes to the hills

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.540
from whence cometh our help.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.220
Our help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.540
We need to have that eternal focus,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.140
not that temporal focus.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.140
And I understand, listen, tonight on your worst day,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.839
you're still going to heaven.

00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:48.940
Do you think that way?

00:25:49.859 --> 00:25:50.700
I hope you do.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.019
On your worst day, you say, pastor,

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:56.179
everything that could have gone wrong today did.

00:25:56.179 --> 00:25:58.299
You ever have a day like that?

00:25:58.299 --> 00:26:01.660
But you're still going to heaven, amen?

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.260
Seriously, I'm trying to help us understand this truth,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:10.260
this command, this instruction, rejoice evermore

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.579
with God's help and by God's grace.

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:13.980
We can do it.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.239
God calls us to live different because we are different.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.500
It's not natural, it's not normal for the carnal man,

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:27.959
the old man, to rejoice at all times.

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:31.660
And you can find people that will come alongside you

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.820
and say, oh, I understand, yeah, I mean, it's hard.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.220
And man, you have a right to complain about this.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.220
No, no, rejoice evermore.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.579
The Bible says that God heard their complaint

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:50.660
in the book of Numbers and he was not pleased.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.619
He was not pleased.

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:54.700
God hears it when we complain.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.700
He hears it when we murmur.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.920
But he also hears it when we rejoice.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.339
You know, what do you think he enjoys hearing?

00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.899
He likes it when we rejoice.

00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:06.779
There's a song, God Wants to Hear You Sing.

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:10.420
I think at some point, I think my family

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.579
or somebody sang that song here.

00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:14.059
God wants to hear you sing.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.739
He wants to hear you lift your voice and rejoice.

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:21.579
In the good times, but also in the,

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:24.059
what we would call as being not so good times.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.820
But understand, God is good all the time.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.820
His goodness is not based on your circumstances or mine.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.019
Think about two passages of scripture with me

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.779
very quickly before we pray this evening.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:38.239
Exodus 13, I'm gonna use one example

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:40.299
from the Old Testament, one from the New.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.420
God has all power, he has a purpose, he has a plan.

00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:50.739
Look at this passage of scripture

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:54.380
and I think about being Moses in the congregation

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.179
that would be led out of Egypt in Exodus 13

00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:00.779
after the death of the firstborn, the 10th plague.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.820
And I want you to see what the Bible says

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.260
in Exodus 13 in verse 17 and 18.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.579
It says this, and it came to pass

00:28:09.579 --> 00:28:11.500
when Pharaoh had let the people go.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.100
Notice these words that God led them.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.540
God led them.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.579
Who led them?

00:28:17.899 --> 00:28:18.959
God led them, right?

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:21.739
Not Moses, he's the human leader, but God led them.

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:22.820
Notice what the Bible says,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.700
not through the way of the land of the Philistines.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.700
Then notice this next phrase, although that was near.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.820
Now let me ask you this question.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.340
With it being near, do you think it might've been

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.820
the preferred route?

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.580
Do you think there might've been some people that said,

00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:41.320
hey, why aren't we going this way?

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.979
I remember talking to a missionary one time

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:45.780
and they were talking about a trip

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.460
that they went from one church to another church

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.979
and they said, the little kid, and he said,

00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:51.299
yeah, we took the long cut.

00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:53.460
I never heard somebody use that phraseology before.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.059
I heard many people say we took the short cut.

00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:57.299
He said, we took the long cut, and I said,

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:58.780
youngster, I don't understand what you mean by that.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.260
He said, well, it took us an awfully long time.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.659
I guess we took the long cut.

00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:04.020
It was kind of comical hearing that from a young kid,

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.700
but the reality is that most people, look, it was near,

00:29:07.739 --> 00:29:09.619
but it wasn't God's way.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.340
It was near, but it wasn't God's way.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.419
Notice what it says.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:16.979
For God said, lest peradventure the people repent

00:29:16.979 --> 00:29:18.900
when they see war and they return to Egypt.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.700
But God led the people about through the way

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.140
of the wilderness of the Red Sea,

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.619
and the children of Israel went up,

00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:25.940
harnessed onto the land of Egypt.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.940
Now I don't have time to read all of this this evening

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.020
and go through all of this, but very quickly understand

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.900
that where God led them, they come to a place,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.340
Pi-ha-hi-rith, and they're there in that place,

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340
and the sea is before them,

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.780
and eventually the Egyptians will be behind them.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.179
The Egyptians have the idea they're entangled in the land.

00:29:43.179 --> 00:29:45.179
We're going to be able to overtake them.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.580
What happens to the people?

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.340
They say, you've brought us here to die.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.020
There's not enough graves in Egypt,

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.700
all of these kinds of things.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.539
But God had a purpose.

00:29:58.539 --> 00:30:00.380
God had a plan for leadership.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.120
leading them the way that He did.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.220
Sometimes we may not see it.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.500
Have you ever read Exodus 14?

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.300
I wish I was there.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.400
The parting of the Red Sea.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.600
It's an amazing miracle

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.200
of God's deliverance,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.740
but of God's amazing power.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.540
And He delivered His people.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.580
Amen?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.980
But they don't have that deliverance

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.880
if they turn back, if they don't go.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.280
And so God had a plan.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.420
God had a purpose.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.520
They were exactly where they were supposed to be.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.060
And sometimes in your life, you say,

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.320
God, why are we going that way?

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.720
I don't want to go that way.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.000
This way looks a lot better.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.600
But God says, I have something for you this way.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.900
I know what the impact of that way can have on you.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.040
Right?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.480
We saw that in verse 17.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.080
And so this evening, we find that God has a purpose.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.020
We find that God has a plan.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.120
He demonstrates His power.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.120
And we find that here in the book of Exodus,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.960
what a great example.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.280
Turn to John chapter 11.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.720
Let me show you a New Testament example

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.760
of this truth this evening

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.720
as we tie these things together.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.760
And we understand that God has all power.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.300
He has a purpose.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.100
He has a plan.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.940
We find that in John chapter 11,

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.340
Jesus receives word that one that He loves is sick.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.100
His name is Lazarus.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.360
We find that Jesus, the Bible actually says this,

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.940
that He whom thou lovest is sick.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.140
We find that Mary and Martha,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.300
they're gravely concerned

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.900
about the condition of their brother.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.580
And they send some servants to go

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.440
and to bring the news to the Savior.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.540
What do you think they expected Jesus to do?

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.620
To come right away and to heal Lazarus.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.480
By the way, if you read through John chapter 11,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.260
it was custom within the Jewish culture

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.280
where after the death of an individual,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.720
there would be people that would come

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.920
and mourn with the family, mourners, if you will.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.260
And we find that those Jews that were gathered

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.720
during this time after Jesus wept,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.540
in John 11 and verse 35,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.639
those Jewish people say they see through His actions,

00:32:13.639 --> 00:32:14.880
oh, how He loved him.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.040
And then they say this,

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.040
could not He who healed the man that was blind,

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.220
couldn't He have healed him?

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.480
Yeah, He could have, but God has a purpose.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.320
Look in John 11 and verse number six,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320
the Bible says this,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.540
when He, Jesus, heard therefore that He was sick,

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.380
notice the next words, He abode two days.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.120
Still in the same place where He was.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.720
That wasn't what Mary and Martha expected to happen.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.800
There's a divine delay in John chapter 11.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.020
Jesus eventually tells the disciples, let's go.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.919
And He says, Lazarus is dead.

00:32:58.139 --> 00:32:59.779
And I want you to notice in verse number 15,

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:02.980
what the Bible says, Jesus says this to the disciples.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.360
He says, and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.900
to the intent, notice what He says,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.900
ye may believe, nevertheless, let us go unto Him.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.700
If you study through John chapter 11,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.880
you're gonna find something very,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.580
I can't preach it all tonight because of time,

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.020
but you're gonna find something amazing

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.000
in John chapter 11.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.760
Here's what you're gonna find, I've preached it before,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.160
but here's what you're gonna find.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.760
The disciples, Mary, Martha,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.720
and even the Jews that were mourning,

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.720
they all believed that Jesus, had He been there,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.680
could have healed Lazarus of his sickness.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.559
They all believed it.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.160
But you know how many of them believed

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.779
that He could raise Lazarus from the dead?

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:46.660
Not one.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.120
You know what Jesus does in John chapter 11?

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.520
He says, move that stone.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.760
Martha says, oh no, no, listen,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.120
He's been dead for four days, He stinks.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.440
Surely He stinketh.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.340
Right?

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:04.520
He says, no, no, move the stone.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.520
And He says, Lazarus, come forth.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.960
And what happens?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.840
Well, Lazarus comes walking out.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.520
He says, take those grave clothes off of him.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.020
I mean, it's amazing, God's power.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.820
But understand with me this evening,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.619
that Mary and Martha and the disciples

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.300
and all of those Jews, the mourners that were there,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.940
and might I say us this evening,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.619
and every child of God that's read the Bible,

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:37.459
would not have John 11 the way that we have it,

00:34:37.459 --> 00:34:38.660
if Jesus would have just gone

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.260
and healed him of his sickness.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.059
But He says, I want you to believe.

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:45.420
Believe what?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.179
Believe that God can do anything.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.839
Believe that God can do anything.

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:52.360
He said, is anything too hard for me?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.520
He said, with me, nothing is impossible.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.839
In Luke 1 and verse 37.

00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:02.080
This evening, the simple charge,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.320
the simple instruction in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 16,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.500
rejoice evermore.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.160
Literally to rejoice at all times.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.119
When we do, we're being obedient.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.880
I believe that it requires that we're observant,

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.320
that we look for the hand of God.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.200
We look for opportunities, we're purposed

00:35:27.279 --> 00:35:29.360
with regard to rejoicing.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.980
No, no, it's easy to complain, it's easy to murmur.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.320
I understand, I have the same flesh that you do.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.899
I understand, it's easy.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.480
But God says, rejoice evermore.

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:43.679
Walk worthy and please God.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:47.600
It is pleasing when we rejoice evermore.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.600
God wants His church to be a rejoicing church.

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:57.339
He wants His people to be a rejoicing people.

00:35:57.339 --> 00:36:00.940
This evening, rejoice evermore.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.080
I hope that you could fill in

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.679
so many other reasons to rejoice.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:06.520
Try to boil it into three categories tonight

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.880
because He has all power, because He has a purpose,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.800
and because He has a plan.

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:11.959
Let's pray together.

00:36:11.959 --> 00:36:12.959
Father, we love you.

00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:14.200
We thank you for loving us.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.200
We thank you that you are God,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.559
that you do indeed have all power.

00:36:21.399 --> 00:36:25.239
We thank you that you move always with purpose.

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:26.520
We thank you that you have a plan

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.000
and that your plan includes us.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.020
I thank you that your plan will never be overthrown.

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:38.520
I thank you that one day I will see you face to face.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.520
Oh, what a wonderful day that will be.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.080
God, I pray that you'd help us, help me,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.080
help us to be a church that rejoices,

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.320
that rejoices evermore.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.880
Help us, Lord, to please you and honor you.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.160
Thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.480
I pray that you would work in and through these moments

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.440
and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.640
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
