1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
at this particular point in his life and the record that we have of his life.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,800
We find that the Bible tells us, beginning in the latter section of Genesis 11,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,399
about the way in which Abram departed from the Ur of the Chaldees,

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:15,359
and he was following the direction of the Lord.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,120
And we find that the Lord appeared to Abram, and the Lord spake to Abram.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,639
And we've read a number of accounts already

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,520
in which God tells us that he speaks with Abram.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,200
As we continue to journey through the biblical record of the life of Abram,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,520
and of course, in just a short period of time,

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,200
his name will be changed to Abraham, and we often refer to him as Abraham.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,919
And we will find that there are many interactions between the Lord,

12
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,159
God Almighty, and Abraham.

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,759
And I'm so thankful when we read, and the Bible says that the Lord spake to Abram,

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,319
and the Lord spoke to him.

15
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:53,599
And we read that phraseology throughout the scriptures,

16
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,720
not only with regard to Abraham, but others as well.

17
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,119
And what a joy it is to know that God speaks to his children.

18
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,360
We understand this evening that God is not speaking to us in an audible voice,

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,639
like he did to Abraham and to many of the others

20
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,639
that are written there within the Word of God.

21
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:14,080
But I find that each time I open the Word of God,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040
I understand that this book that we hold in our hands,

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,559
the Bible says, all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

24
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,400
That means God breathed.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,519
We believe every word is God's word.

26
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
And therefore, when I read my Bible, when you read your Bible,

27
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,440
you're reading the Word of God.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,199
The Lord is speaking to you.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,599
And what a joy that is.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,400
We find that in this particular greeting that we find in verse number one of Genesis 15,

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,000
I find it to be of great interest for two reasons.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Number one, the circumstances surrounding the greeting,

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,319
and then coupled with the content of the greeting,

34
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,639
the way in which the Lord by revelation is revealing more of his character to his servant.

35
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,000
What a blessing that is.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,839
And so this evening, if you're taking notes,

37
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:05,599
I want to title the message, A Memorable Greeting.

38
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,199
There are some times in which we receive greetings from individuals,

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,720
and they are more memorable than other greetings.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,960
And we find that Abraham will have a number of times in his life

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,720
in which he receives greetings such as this.

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,639
But again, this greeting, to me, from my perspective,

43
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,240
is of great interest because of the circumstances and because of the content.

44
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:35,759
It's interesting to me that right at the beginning of this verse of Scripture,

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,720
the Bible says,

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
after these things,

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
if we could just pause there for a moment

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,440
and offer a word of encouragement and comfort to the people of God,

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,279
we understand this evening,

50
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,440
when we read those three words,

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,279
after these things,

52
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,839
we understand that God knows where you are.

53
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,479
God knows what you're dealing with.

54
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,039
He knows the circumstances that you're facing.

55
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,800
After these things, we find contextually

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,559
that he's dealing with the subject matter,

57
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:13,199
the content of Genesis chapter number 14.

58
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,440
Of course, as we've spent two weeks looking at that content that is recorded

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
in that passage of Scripture,

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,520
we find that there was a great military campaign there in the Vale of Siddam,

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,000
and we find that Lot had been taken captive

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,479
just as many others within that coalition had been taken captive.

63
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,880
And Abram took his trained servants,

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,559
and they went and they recovered all,

65
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,479
and God gave the victory.

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,399
He had two meetings.

67
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:41,360
We find that the first meeting,

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,119
it was the king of Sodom that went out to meet Abram,

69
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,320
but before that meeting took place,

70
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,720
Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,759
met with Abram,

72
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,360
and we find that through the content of that meeting

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,639
that Abram was properly prepared to deal

74
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,679
with what the king of Sodom would speak to him about,

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,479
how critical our time with God is,

76
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,199
and how precious our time with God is,

77
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,720
and how He prepares us.

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
But we find that here,

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,639
as we notice these words after these things,

80
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,399
the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision.

81
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
God knew where he was.

82
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
God knew what he was dealing with.

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,519
We understand this evening that our God is actively involved

84
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,839
in the affairs of His children.

85
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,799
He knows where we are.

86
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,320
He knows what we're dealing with.

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,399
There are times in which perhaps we deal with circumstances in life,

88
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,119
and we might let ourselves believe this.

89
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,799
Does anybody understand?

90
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,959
We can rest assured that God does.

91
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,799
And God is actively involved in the affairs

92
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,399
in the lives of His children,

93
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,799
and we can rejoice in that this evening.

94
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:54,959
And so we find that God comes to him in that moment,

95
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,640
in that time,

96
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,559
and notice what God says.

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,519
Fear not, Abram.

98
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,679
Fear not.

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,399
We've mentioned as we study the book of Genesis

100
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,160
that there are a number of times in which we'll find the first mention.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,320
This is the first mention in all of the Word of God

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,239
that you'll read these words,

103
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:14,799
fear not.

104
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,760
We know that those words will be repeated.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,440
In fact, fear not is found 63 times in our Bible.

106
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
We find that the phrase,

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,519
be not afraid,

108
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,799
another 26 times,

109
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,160
and that phrase,

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,119
fear thou not,

111
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,679
is referenced four times in our Bibles.

112
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,119
Now, you could couple a number of other truths within the Word of God

113
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,279
dealing with the subject matter of fear,

114
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,799
and you can find that there's many, many truths

115
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,799
that God gives us with regard to not having fear

116
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,559
and having the peace of God.

117
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,799
We find that Abram receives this particular greeting from the Lord,

118
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,399
and when the Lord begins to speak to him in this vision,

119
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,920
he starts out by saying,

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,239
fear not, Abram.

121
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,440
And we think about this subject matter of fear.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880
This is something that we deal with.

123
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
It's an emotion that human beings deal with.

124
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,160
And God says, fear not.

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,679
As we look at the remainder of the text here over the next few moments,

126
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,920
we'll find why it is that God is able to say to His children, fear not.

127
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,799
And we find this evening that we could ask ourselves the question,

128
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,640
why is it that Abram could possibly be fearful?

129
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I mean, when you read the content of Genesis 14,

130
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
he's just experienced great victory.

131
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,720
And we mentioned as we looked at Genesis 14

132
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,679
the importance of being close to the Lord during those times of victory

133
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:49,040
and how God had orchestrated that meeting with Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,559
to be able to give revelation to Abram

135
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,880
and to help Abram to be prepared for that situation with Sodom,

136
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,880
the king of Sodom,

137
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
where he would come in and make that proposition, if you will, to Abram.

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,760
And we find that God says, fear not.

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Perhaps it's just a thought this evening.

140
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,160
Perhaps Abram understood the possibility of a revenge attack.

141
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,440
You find many times when you would think about this coalition

142
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,679
that had been defeated and Abram went out.

143
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,519
Remember, he returned all, that they go back and they regroup

144
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,040
and they're going to go after Abram.

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,839
Now, we don't know.

146
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,399
It doesn't tell us that that's the content,

147
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,959
but certainly that could be a thought that Abram would have.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,920
And God appears to Abram in those circumstances,

149
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,600
at this time, after these events in Genesis 14,

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,239
and he begins with the phrase, the greeting, fear not, Abram.

151
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,239
You know, as God's people, we've not been given the spirit of fear.

152
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,119
We're not to be a fearful people.

153
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,799
We're to fear the Lord.

154
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,839
We're to fear God.

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,760
We're not to be afraid.

156
00:07:56,799 --> 00:08:02,559
And it's not that we have this some type of worldly perspective.

157
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:06,079
I remember as a child,

158
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,359
there was a name brand of some sort of not being afraid and so on and so forth.

159
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:15,519
And, you know, you'd have all of these particular things that you would talk about.

160
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,559
But the reality this evening is that as a child of God,

161
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:22,559
when I understand who God is and I understand what he is to me,

162
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,760
then I don't have to fear the things of life

163
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,040
because I know that my God's in control and I know that he has a plan.

164
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
We find that he says, fear not.

165
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,919
And I want you to notice the next statement.

166
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,960
I am thy shield.

167
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
I am thy shield.

168
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
Isn't that powerful?

169
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,520
What a precious truth of the Word of God.

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,000
What comfort and peace it would bring to the child of God to understand.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,520
And as we think this evening and look at this passage of Scripture

172
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,919
and understanding again the context of all that has transpired historically

173
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,200
with the record that is given and God saying to Abram,

174
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,599
fear not, I am thy shield.

175
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,440
God is our protection.

176
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,919
God is our protection.

177
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,200
I want you to think about this truth that has been revealed to Abram.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,119
But we find that throughout the Word of God,

179
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:22,559
there are a number of people that have been given a similar promise

180
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,359
that he, God, is our shield, our buckler.

181
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,840
And what a joy to have that understanding.

182
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,119
Hold your place here in Genesis.

183
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,479
We'll be back in just a moment.

184
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,200
Turn to the book of 2 Samuel in chapter 22, if you will.

185
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,760
And then we'll look at a few references over there in the book of Psalms.

186
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,239
But in 2 Samuel, chapter number 22,

187
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:46,159
I want you to notice the song of David as it's often been referenced.

188
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,200
And of course, he's the sweet psalmist of Israel.

189
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,000
But we find this in this text here in 2 Samuel, chapter 22.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
The Bible says this in verse number 31,

191
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,320
Ask for God, His way is perfect.

192
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,919
The word of the Lord is true.

193
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,199
He is tried.

194
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,979
He is a buckler to all them

195
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,959
that trust in Him.

196
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,559
For who is God? Save the Lord.

197
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,159
And who is a rock? Save our God.

198
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,999
God is my strength and power,

199
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,759
and He maketh my way perfect."

200
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,399
See, David understood something

201
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,359
about the fact that God was his shield

202
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,439
or his buckler,

203
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,919
and he's rejoicing and thanking the Lord

204
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,719
for understanding.

205
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,999
We understand here in v. 31

206
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,559
that the word buckler is used.

207
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,639
If you back up into the text of Scripture

208
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,319
in v. 3, the Bible says this.

209
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:31,759
We'll look at v. 2 with it.

210
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,519
And he said,

211
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,119
"...the Lord is my rock and my fortress

212
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,119
and my deliverer,

213
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,279
the God of my rock.

214
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,119
In Him will I trust.

215
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,119
He is my shield

216
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,919
and the horn of my salvation,

217
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,639
my high tower and my refuge,

218
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,479
my Savior.

219
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,239
Thou savest me from violence."

220
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,439
The word shield and the word buckler

221
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:51,999
in the Hebrew is the same exact word.

222
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,839
They're synonymous one with the other.

223
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,919
It's the same Hebrew word.

224
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,199
We find that here,

225
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,839
David recognizes this precious truth

226
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,719
that the Lord is my shield.

227
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,999
He is my buckler.

228
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,559
This evening, we find that it's a personal reference

229
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,839
that David gives,

230
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,039
and he's understanding.

231
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,879
And I wonder this evening,

232
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,119
how often do we go through life

233
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,199
when we journey,

234
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,199
when we deal with the things of life

235
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,239
and all that life brings our way,

236
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,759
how often do we enter each day

237
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,399
understanding the Lord is my shield?

238
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,359
He's my buckler.

239
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,159
He is my protection.

240
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,879
And Abram is given this greeting.

241
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,039
Fear not, Abram.

242
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,759
I am thy shield.

243
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,079
Psalms. In the book of Psalms,

244
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,159
we'll look at a number of verses.

245
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,839
Psalm 3 to begin.

246
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,799
And look at the third psalm if you will.

247
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,199
And we'll look at the third verse

248
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:48,759
of this particular psalm.

249
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,239
Of course, it's the psalm of David.

250
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,639
We use that passage in 2 Samuel 22.

251
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
And we'll see a number of references here

252
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,279
throughout the psalms

253
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,399
where David is repeating

254
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,559
this wonderful truth of the Word of God.

255
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,359
It says this in Psalm 3 and verse 3,

256
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:06,319
"...but Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

257
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:09,959
my glory and the lifter up of mine head."

258
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,839
Turn over to chapter 18 if you will.

259
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,279
Look at verse 2.

260
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,999
I want to look at verse 1 along with it.

261
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,319
In verse 1, it says this,

262
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:24,199
"...I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.

263
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,759
The Lord is my rock, my fortress,

264
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,639
and my deliverer, my God, my strength,

265
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
and whom I will trust, my buckler,

266
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,559
and the horn of my salvation,

267
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,239
and my high tower."

268
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,639
Now, let me submit to you this evening

269
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,479
that when you understand these things

270
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,679
about who God is,

271
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,719
we mentioned we started our series

272
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,959
on Wednesday evening.

273
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,879
We returned to the study of the book of Titus

274
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,759
and we picked up with the sound doctrine aspect

275
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,839
of what's being dealt with there in Titus 2

276
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,759
in verse 1.

277
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,359
And we dealt with bibliology

278
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,439
and on Wednesday evening,

279
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,679
we started the section dealing with theology

280
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,559
and understanding who God is.

281
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,639
When you understand who He is,

282
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,319
it really changes your life.

283
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,599
And we find that because the psalmist understood

284
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,599
the Lord is my rock,

285
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,959
and he goes through and lists all of the things

286
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,999
that God is to him,

287
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,319
notice the response.

288
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,719
Notice the result of understanding who God is.

289
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:24,239
I will call upon the Lord.

290
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,559
You're going to call upon Him

291
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,119
because you understand who He is.

292
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,439
You're going to call upon Him

293
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,359
because you understand what He can do.

294
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,719
And we find the psalmist says,

295
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,039
who is worthy to be praised,

296
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,799
so shall I be saved from my enemies.

297
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,719
Look down and look at v. 30.

298
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,719
The Bible says this,

299
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,359
ask for God, His way is perfect.

300
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,199
Very similar to what we just read

301
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,759
in 2 Samuel 22 and v. 31.

302
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,439
The Word of the Lord is tried.

303
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:49,679
He is a buckler to all those that trust in Him.

304
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,799
Psalm 28 and v. 7.

305
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,919
The Lord is my strength and my shield.

306
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,279
My heart trusted in Him and I am helped.

307
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,519
Therefore, my heart greatly rejoiceth

308
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,399
and with my song will I praise Him.

309
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:16,999
Psalm 33 and v. 20.

310
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,159
Our soul waiteth for the Lord.

311
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,199
He is our help and our shield.

312
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,639
I'm so thankful.

313
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,119
There are many other references

314
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,799
that we could look at this evening.

315
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,799
For sake of time, we'll stop there

316
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,359
with looking at the references,

317
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,199
but I want you to just rejoice this evening

318
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,839
in understanding that as Abram

319
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,239
is given this truth,

320
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,639
this revelation from God of who God is,

321
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,799
He comes after those things,

322
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,919
after those events,

323
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,279
and in that time when Abram needed

324
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,159
to hear this Word from God

325
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,759
and Abram receives this first statement,

326
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,519
fear not, I am thy shield.

327
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,479
We can rejoice in understanding

328
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,359
that God is our protector.

329
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,239
He's our protection.

330
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,559
And by the way,

331
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,839
no one can protect you like God can protect you.

332
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,439
Amen?

333
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:13,759
I'm thankful for that this evening.

334
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,759
There are times in which God protects us

335
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,959
and we might not even know

336
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,399
what He's protecting us from.

337
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,999
We're completely blinded and oblivious to it.

338
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:25,079
There are times in which He will allow us

339
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,639
to see how He was protecting us.

340
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,839
But I see here with Abram,

341
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
and we understand again the things

342
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,159
that we dealt with last week

343
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,919
as we finish up the 14th chapter

344
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,239
and how Abram is receiving that revelation

345
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,199
from Melchizedek,

346
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,159
understanding that God,

347
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,879
remember we said that He's the Most High God.

348
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,799
He's the possessor of heaven and earth.

349
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,199
The first times that those truths

350
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
are given in the Word of God

351
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,439
and now God comes and in this vision

352
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,759
as He's speaking to Abram,

353
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,359
He says, I am thy shield.

354
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:01,359
And that's encouraging.

355
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,559
This evening,

356
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,679
we need to be reminded and comforted

357
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,559
in knowing that He is our protector.

358
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,759
We often speak about the shepherd,

359
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,599
and someone said this recently,

360
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,719
I don't know much about my responsibilities.

361
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:21,599
He was a pastor and speaking about

362
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,439
the responsibilities of the under-shepherd.

363
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:24,839
He said, but I know as an under-shepherd

364
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,919
I'm supposed to protect.

365
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,239
And that is a responsibility.

366
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,679
And you understand that as you look

367
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,719
at the truth when the psalmist says to us

368
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,799
there in Psalm 23,

369
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,159
the Lord is my shepherd,

370
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,719
and you go through the portion of Scripture

371
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:41,439
and you rejoice in that very familiar passage,

372
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,599
you understand that the shepherd,

373
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,399
it's not only the provision,

374
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,839
but it's the protection of the shepherd.

375
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,679
And I'm so thankful that He is our shield.

376
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,959
Notice back in Genesis 15.

377
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,599
Not only does God appear to Abram

378
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,039
and say, fear not.

379
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,159
Listen, Abram, you do not need to be fearful.

380
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,119
You don't need to have that spirit of fear.

381
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,599
Fear not, Abram.

382
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,199
Here's why.

383
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,919
I am thy shield.

384
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,479
And then He says this,

385
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:16,599
and thy exceeding great reward.

386
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,039
Now when we think about that phraseology,

387
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,879
and we think about it within the context

388
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,039
of what has happened,

389
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,279
you remember as I mentioned to you

390
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,879
last Sunday evening,

391
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,639
that the King of Sodom came

392
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:31,839
and He said to Abram,

393
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,399
give Me the persons and take the goods.

394
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,439
And we find that Abram then said back

395
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,079
to the King of Sodom,

396
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,439
he says, I have lift up mine hand

397
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,879
unto the Lord, the Most High God,

398
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:47,919
the Possessor of heaven and earth.

399
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,679
What did He say?

400
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,119
I'm not going to take anything from you

401
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,639
that I will not take from a thread

402
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,079
even to a shoelatchet,

403
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,719
that I will not take anything

404
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:57,559
that is thine lest thou shouldst say

405
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,479
I have made Abram rich.

406
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,759
And we dealt with that last week.

407
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,279
Thoroughly dealt with that.

408
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,799
But we come to chapter 15,

409
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,719
and of course, we understand

410
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,919
chapter divisions were put in after, right?

411
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,559
And so really it's a continuation.

412
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,079
It's ease of us being able

413
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,239
to find our place in the Scriptures.

414
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,239
But in that context of Abram

415
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,599
rejecting that which Sodom,

416
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,079
the King of Sodom, had offered him,

417
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,999
God appears to him and says,

418
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:26,479
fear not, I am thy shield,

419
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:30,559
I am thy exceeding great reward.

420
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,639
See, the King of Sodom

421
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,200
was trying to make that deal

422
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
and trying to give him those things.

423
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,239
You can keep the goods.

424
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,679
I want the people.

425
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,159
And Abram had gone out

426
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,959
and of course, he brought everything back.

427
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,719
And so in customary,

428
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,679
in that particular time,

429
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,359
certainly could have kept all of it.

430
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,760
But we find that he said,

431
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,639
no, I don't need it.

432
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,639
And God then comes and says,

433
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,919
I am thy reward,

434
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,119
thy exceeding great reward.

435
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,119
And we think about this.

436
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,200
No doubt this evening,

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,799
God rewards his children.

438
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,000
No doubt.

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,599
In fact, a verse that we've quoted often this year

440
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,159
with regard to our theme

441
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,880
and the subject matter of Hebrews 11 in particular,

442
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
without faith, it is impossible to please him

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,440
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is

444
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,519
and that he is a rewarder of them

445
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,679
that diligently seek him.

446
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,440
So we understand that God rewards his children,

447
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,159
but can I tell you that this truth,

448
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,079
we must grasp with our minds this evening,

449
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,880
that he is our reward.

450
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,599
He says, I, it says,

451
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,440
I am thy shield

452
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,159
and thy exceeding great reward.

453
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,000
That I am his and he is mine.

454
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
Can you imagine that this evening?

455
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:52,440
And remember, contextually,

456
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,320
what the enemy wanted to offer Abram.

457
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,880
I'm going to give you these goods,

458
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
but just give me the people.

459
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,600
and he says no I've lift up my hand unto the Lord the Most High God the

460
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,520
Possessor of heaven and earth and we find that yes he is the Possessor of

461
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,840
heaven and earth but then he says to Abram more than being the Possessor of

462
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,800
heaven earth I want you to understand I am thy exceeding great reward do you

463
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:27,280
know how precious it is that God is your father I mean sometimes we just we trust

464
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,640
that Christ is our Savior and we just yeah I'm a child of God and maybe we

465
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:40,720
don't pause and really just allow it to really grip our souls that God's hand of

466
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,240
favor and God's blessing and all of those things that he's bestowed upon us

467
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,920
those are great I'm thankful for them the psalmist said he daily loaded me

468
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,720
with benefits and he does but he is my exceeding great reward that I can enter

469
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,800
into his presence we sang tonight in the garden Terry with him you know God

470
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,160
never says your times up you ever have a meeting the person you're meeting with

471
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,580
they make it kind of obvious it's time for you to leave your appointments over

472
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,280
your times up they have something else to deal with that never happens with God

473
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:21,840
we're not on a timer with God he is our reward and this evening we understand as

474
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,960
I dealt with last year in in great detail in the book of Ephesians when

475
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Paul is is given great truth of the church at Ephesus and understanding the

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
fact that that we have an inheritance and we do and Peter deals with the

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,160
inheritance but we understand that forever and ever people talk about what

478
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,560
is heaven gonna be like and what are all of these things gonna be like the fact

479
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:50,120
that I'm gonna be with my Redeemer for all of eternity I understand the streets

480
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,600
of gold I understand all of that which comes with it but the reality this

481
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,720
evening is that God says to Abram I am thy shield and by exceeding great

482
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,720
reward and as God would reveal these truths to Abram in Genesis 15 in verse

483
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,160
number one I can't help but consider as I've titled the message this evening a

484
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,280
memorable greeting can you imagine I mean later on I understand there are

485
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
many you could say well memorable greeting number one number two number

486
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,400
three because there's a lot of times that God speaks to Abram and there's

487
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,000
some amazing things when he reveals himself as being El Shaddai the Lord God

488
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,600
Almighty I mean what a powerful truth but I wonder this evening if we can put

489
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:48,160
ourselves in Abram's shoes just for a moment tonight and if we can be there in

490
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:57,720
those circumstances and hear those words from God fear not I am thy shield and I

491
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:06,560
exceeding great reward Abram I'm all that you need I'll take care of you

492
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,600
Abram I am the God of the universe the possessor of heaven and earth he's

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,680
revealed himself that way just a few verses before in this evening as the

494
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,320
people of God as the children of God as we look at the whole of Scripture and we

495
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,480
understand that we've been adopted in the family of God what a joy to know

496
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:37,360
that we don't have to fear why because he's our shield my buckler he's my

497
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,280
protector the protection as a father as a husband I understand the the role and

498
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:53,080
the desire to want to protect my family we understand that God is able to do so

499
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,880
much greater and I just sit back and I just rejoice that God is my shield he's

500
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,880
my protector and therefore I don't need to fear and he's my exceeding great

501
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,680
reward this evening someone has said this I don't know who said it when all

502
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,080
you have is Jesus you find out all you really need is Jesus what I'd say to you

503
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,279
this evening is that there are times in this world that we get so influenced by

504
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
those around us that we think that we need to get things to bring some kind of

505
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,720
satisfaction but understanding tonight that God is our exceeding great reward I

506
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,880
don't need anything but him and when I have him and I do because I'm his child

507
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,000
I have everything that I need the New Testament the Bible tells us that he's

508
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,840
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places he's given us all

509
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,760
things that pertain unto life and godliness he's blessed us immeasurably

510
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,080
but let us not get our eyes strictly on the blessings but on the one who gives

511
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,600
the blessings amen because he's my God he's my shield he's my exceeding great

512
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,320
reward what a greeting I can't help but think the context of Genesis 15 I

513
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,360
couldn't preach it all this evening but the context of Genesis 15 is powerful

514
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,440
and to just think about those words in this greeting this introduction to this

515
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,279
chapter how it must have impacted and influenced Abram and how it must have

516
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:40,000
comforted him and this evening I hope that we'd understand God knows where we

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,320
are he knows what we're dealing with he knows what we're going through he knows

518
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,200
what the circumstances of life are but he still comes and says fear not for I

519
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,960
am thy shield and I exceeding great reward father we love you we thank you

520
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,840
for loving us thank you for the Word of God the truth that is contained therein

521
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,360
divine revelation as we study this book of Genesis we see many references

522
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:22,840
first principle first mentioned principles God I'm so thankful that you

523
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,000
saw the state the condition of your servant Abram and their vision you spoke

524
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,080
to him he gave them these powerful truths and this evening by way of

525
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,600
extension as we understand that just as you were Abram's shield that you're our

526
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:49,800
