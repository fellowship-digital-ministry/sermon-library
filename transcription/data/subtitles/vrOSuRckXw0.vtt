00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
at this particular point in his life and the record that we have of his life.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.800
We find that the Bible tells us, beginning in the latter section of Genesis 11,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.399
about the way in which Abram departed from the Ur of the Chaldees,

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.359
and he was following the direction of the Lord.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.120
And we find that the Lord appeared to Abram, and the Lord spake to Abram.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.639
And we've read a number of accounts already

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.520
in which God tells us that he speaks with Abram.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.200
As we continue to journey through the biblical record of the life of Abram,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.520
and of course, in just a short period of time,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.200
his name will be changed to Abraham, and we often refer to him as Abraham.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.919
And we will find that there are many interactions between the Lord,

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:42.159
God Almighty, and Abraham.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.759
And I'm so thankful when we read, and the Bible says that the Lord spake to Abram,

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.319
and the Lord spoke to him.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.599
And we read that phraseology throughout the scriptures,

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.720
not only with regard to Abraham, but others as well.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.119
And what a joy it is to know that God speaks to his children.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.360
We understand this evening that God is not speaking to us in an audible voice,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.639
like he did to Abraham and to many of the others

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.639
that are written there within the Word of God.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.080
But I find that each time I open the Word of God,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.040
I understand that this book that we hold in our hands,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.559
the Bible says, all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.400
That means God breathed.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.519
We believe every word is God's word.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.519
And therefore, when I read my Bible, when you read your Bible,

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:31.440
you're reading the Word of God.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.199
The Lord is speaking to you.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.599
And what a joy that is.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.400
We find that in this particular greeting that we find in verse number one of Genesis 15,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.000
I find it to be of great interest for two reasons.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.440
Number one, the circumstances surrounding the greeting,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.319
and then coupled with the content of the greeting,

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.639
the way in which the Lord by revelation is revealing more of his character to his servant.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.000
What a blessing that is.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.839
And so this evening, if you're taking notes,

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:05.599
I want to title the message, A Memorable Greeting.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.199
There are some times in which we receive greetings from individuals,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.720
and they are more memorable than other greetings.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.960
And we find that Abraham will have a number of times in his life

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720
in which he receives greetings such as this.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.639
But again, this greeting, to me, from my perspective,

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.240
is of great interest because of the circumstances and because of the content.

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.759
It's interesting to me that right at the beginning of this verse of Scripture,

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.720
the Bible says,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.360
after these things,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.160
if we could just pause there for a moment

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.440
and offer a word of encouragement and comfort to the people of God,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.279
we understand this evening,

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.440
when we read those three words,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.279
after these things,

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.839
we understand that God knows where you are.

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.479
God knows what you're dealing with.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.039
He knows the circumstances that you're facing.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.800
After these things, we find contextually

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.559
that he's dealing with the subject matter,

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.199
the content of Genesis chapter number 14.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.440
Of course, as we've spent two weeks looking at that content that is recorded

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.880
in that passage of Scripture,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.520
we find that there was a great military campaign there in the Vale of Siddam,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.000
and we find that Lot had been taken captive

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.479
just as many others within that coalition had been taken captive.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.880
And Abram took his trained servants,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.559
and they went and they recovered all,

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.479
and God gave the victory.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.399
He had two meetings.

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.360
We find that the first meeting,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.119
it was the king of Sodom that went out to meet Abram,

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.320
but before that meeting took place,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.720
Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.759
met with Abram,

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:55.360
and we find that through the content of that meeting

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.639
that Abram was properly prepared to deal

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.679
with what the king of Sodom would speak to him about,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.479
how critical our time with God is,

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.199
and how precious our time with God is,

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.720
and how He prepares us.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.240
But we find that here,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.639
as we notice these words after these things,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.399
the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.839
God knew where he was.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.440
God knew what he was dealing with.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.519
We understand this evening that our God is actively involved

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.839
in the affairs of His children.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:26.799
He knows where we are.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.320
He knows what we're dealing with.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.399
There are times in which perhaps we deal with circumstances in life,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:35.119
and we might let ourselves believe this.

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:36.799
Does anybody understand?

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:40.959
We can rest assured that God does.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.799
And God is actively involved in the affairs

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.399
in the lives of His children,

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.799
and we can rejoice in that this evening.

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:54.959
And so we find that God comes to him in that moment,

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.640
in that time,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.559
and notice what God says.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.519
Fear not, Abram.

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.679
Fear not.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.399
We've mentioned as we study the book of Genesis

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.160
that there are a number of times in which we'll find the first mention.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.320
This is the first mention in all of the Word of God

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.239
that you'll read these words,

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:14.799
fear not.

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:17.760
We know that those words will be repeated.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440
In fact, fear not is found 63 times in our Bible.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.720
We find that the phrase,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.519
be not afraid,

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.799
another 26 times,

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:26.160
and that phrase,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.119
fear thou not,

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:29.679
is referenced four times in our Bibles.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:35.119
Now, you could couple a number of other truths within the Word of God

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.279
dealing with the subject matter of fear,

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.799
and you can find that there's many, many truths

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.799
that God gives us with regard to not having fear

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.559
and having the peace of God.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.799
We find that Abram receives this particular greeting from the Lord,

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.399
and when the Lord begins to speak to him in this vision,

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.920
he starts out by saying,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.239
fear not, Abram.

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:03.440
And we think about this subject matter of fear.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.880
This is something that we deal with.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.440
It's an emotion that human beings deal with.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.160
And God says, fear not.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.679
As we look at the remainder of the text here over the next few moments,

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:19.920
we'll find why it is that God is able to say to His children, fear not.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.799
And we find this evening that we could ask ourselves the question,

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:28.640
why is it that Abram could possibly be fearful?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.040
I mean, when you read the content of Genesis 14,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.720
he's just experienced great victory.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.720
And we mentioned as we looked at Genesis 14

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.679
the importance of being close to the Lord during those times of victory

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:49.040
and how God had orchestrated that meeting with Melchizedek, the king of Salem,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.559
to be able to give revelation to Abram

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.880
and to help Abram to be prepared for that situation with Sodom,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.880
the king of Sodom,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.440
where he would come in and make that proposition, if you will, to Abram.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.760
And we find that God says, fear not.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640
Perhaps it's just a thought this evening.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.160
Perhaps Abram understood the possibility of a revenge attack.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.440
You find many times when you would think about this coalition

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.679
that had been defeated and Abram went out.

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:23.519
Remember, he returned all, that they go back and they regroup

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.040
and they're going to go after Abram.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.839
Now, we don't know.

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.399
It doesn't tell us that that's the content,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:30.959
but certainly that could be a thought that Abram would have.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.920
And God appears to Abram in those circumstances,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.600
at this time, after these events in Genesis 14,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.239
and he begins with the phrase, the greeting, fear not, Abram.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:48.239
You know, as God's people, we've not been given the spirit of fear.

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:51.119
We're not to be a fearful people.

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:52.799
We're to fear the Lord.

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:53.839
We're to fear God.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.760
We're not to be afraid.

00:07:56.799 --> 00:08:02.559
And it's not that we have this some type of worldly perspective.

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:06.079
I remember as a child,

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:11.359
there was a name brand of some sort of not being afraid and so on and so forth.

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:15.519
And, you know, you'd have all of these particular things that you would talk about.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.559
But the reality this evening is that as a child of God,

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:22.559
when I understand who God is and I understand what he is to me,

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:25.760
then I don't have to fear the things of life

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:31.040
because I know that my God's in control and I know that he has a plan.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.159
We find that he says, fear not.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.919
And I want you to notice the next statement.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.960
I am thy shield.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.200
I am thy shield.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.080
Isn't that powerful?

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:49.520
What a precious truth of the Word of God.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.000
What comfort and peace it would bring to the child of God to understand.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.520
And as we think this evening and look at this passage of Scripture

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.919
and understanding again the context of all that has transpired historically

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:05.200
with the record that is given and God saying to Abram,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.599
fear not, I am thy shield.

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:11.440
God is our protection.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.919
God is our protection.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:17.200
I want you to think about this truth that has been revealed to Abram.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.119
But we find that throughout the Word of God,

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:22.559
there are a number of people that have been given a similar promise

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:25.359
that he, God, is our shield, our buckler.

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:27.840
And what a joy to have that understanding.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.119
Hold your place here in Genesis.

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:30.479
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:33.200
Turn to the book of 2 Samuel in chapter 22, if you will.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:37.760
And then we'll look at a few references over there in the book of Psalms.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.239
But in 2 Samuel, chapter number 22,

00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:46.159
I want you to notice the song of David as it's often been referenced.

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:49.200
And of course, he's the sweet psalmist of Israel.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.000
But we find this in this text here in 2 Samuel, chapter 22.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.080
The Bible says this in verse number 31,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.320
Ask for God, His way is perfect.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.919
The word of the Lord is true.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.199
He is tried.

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.979
He is a buckler to all them

00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:05.959
that trust in Him.

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:07.559
For who is God? Save the Lord.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.159
And who is a rock? Save our God.

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.999
God is my strength and power,

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:13.759
and He maketh my way perfect."

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.399
See, David understood something

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:17.359
about the fact that God was his shield

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:18.439
or his buckler,

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:20.919
and he's rejoicing and thanking the Lord

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.719
for understanding.

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.999
We understand here in v. 31

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.559
that the word buckler is used.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.639
If you back up into the text of Scripture

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:30.319
in v. 3, the Bible says this.

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:31.759
We'll look at v. 2 with it.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.519
And he said,

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.119
"...the Lord is my rock and my fortress

00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:35.119
and my deliverer,

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.279
the God of my rock.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.119
In Him will I trust.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:40.119
He is my shield

00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:41.919
and the horn of my salvation,

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.639
my high tower and my refuge,

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:44.479
my Savior.

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:47.239
Thou savest me from violence."

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.439
The word shield and the word buckler

00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:51.999
in the Hebrew is the same exact word.

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:53.839
They're synonymous one with the other.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.919
It's the same Hebrew word.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:57.199
We find that here,

00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:00.839
David recognizes this precious truth

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:03.719
that the Lord is my shield.

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:05.999
He is my buckler.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.559
This evening, we find that it's a personal reference

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.839
that David gives,

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.039
and he's understanding.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:12.879
And I wonder this evening,

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.119
how often do we go through life

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:16.199
when we journey,

00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:19.199
when we deal with the things of life

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:21.239
and all that life brings our way,

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:23.759
how often do we enter each day

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:27.399
understanding the Lord is my shield?

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.359
He's my buckler.

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:31.159
He is my protection.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:33.879
And Abram is given this greeting.

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:36.039
Fear not, Abram.

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:38.759
I am thy shield.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.079
Psalms. In the book of Psalms,

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.159
we'll look at a number of verses.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.839
Psalm 3 to begin.

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.799
And look at the third psalm if you will.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.199
And we'll look at the third verse

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:48.759
of this particular psalm.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.239
Of course, it's the psalm of David.

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:52.639
We use that passage in 2 Samuel 22.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.399
And we'll see a number of references here

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.279
throughout the psalms

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.399
where David is repeating

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.559
this wonderful truth of the Word of God.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.359
It says this in Psalm 3 and verse 3,

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:06.319
"...but Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:09.959
my glory and the lifter up of mine head."

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.839
Turn over to chapter 18 if you will.

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:16.279
Look at verse 2.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.999
I want to look at verse 1 along with it.

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:20.319
In verse 1, it says this,

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:24.199
"...I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:27.759
The Lord is my rock, my fortress,

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:30.639
and my deliverer, my God, my strength,

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.959
and whom I will trust, my buckler,

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:34.559
and the horn of my salvation,

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:36.239
and my high tower."

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:38.639
Now, let me submit to you this evening

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.479
that when you understand these things

00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:42.679
about who God is,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.719
we mentioned we started our series

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:45.959
on Wednesday evening.

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:47.879
We returned to the study of the book of Titus

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:51.759
and we picked up with the sound doctrine aspect

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:53.839
of what's being dealt with there in Titus 2

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:54.759
in verse 1.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.359
And we dealt with bibliology

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.439
and on Wednesday evening,

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:00.679
we started the section dealing with theology

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.559
and understanding who God is.

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:04.639
When you understand who He is,

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.319
it really changes your life.

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:10.599
And we find that because the psalmist understood

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.599
the Lord is my rock,

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:14.959
and he goes through and lists all of the things

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:15.999
that God is to him,

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:17.319
notice the response.

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:20.719
Notice the result of understanding who God is.

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:24.239
I will call upon the Lord.

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:25.559
You're going to call upon Him

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:27.119
because you understand who He is.

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:28.439
You're going to call upon Him

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:30.359
because you understand what He can do.

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:31.719
And we find the psalmist says,

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:33.039
who is worthy to be praised,

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:34.799
so shall I be saved from my enemies.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:36.719
Look down and look at v. 30.

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:37.719
The Bible says this,

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.359
ask for God, His way is perfect.

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:41.199
Very similar to what we just read

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:43.759
in 2 Samuel 22 and v. 31.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.439
The Word of the Lord is tried.

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:49.679
He is a buckler to all those that trust in Him.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:55.799
Psalm 28 and v. 7.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.919
The Lord is my strength and my shield.

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:02.279
My heart trusted in Him and I am helped.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.519
Therefore, my heart greatly rejoiceth

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:09.399
and with my song will I praise Him.

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:16.999
Psalm 33 and v. 20.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:20.159
Our soul waiteth for the Lord.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:26.199
He is our help and our shield.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.639
I'm so thankful.

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.119
There are many other references

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.799
that we could look at this evening.

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:32.799
For sake of time, we'll stop there

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.359
with looking at the references,

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.199
but I want you to just rejoice this evening

00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.839
in understanding that as Abram

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:40.239
is given this truth,

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:43.639
this revelation from God of who God is,

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.799
He comes after those things,

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:46.919
after those events,

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.279
and in that time when Abram needed

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.159
to hear this Word from God

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:53.759
and Abram receives this first statement,

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:58.519
fear not, I am thy shield.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:00.479
We can rejoice in understanding

00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:03.359
that God is our protector.

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:05.239
He's our protection.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.559
And by the way,

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:09.839
no one can protect you like God can protect you.

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.439
Amen?

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:13.759
I'm thankful for that this evening.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:15.759
There are times in which God protects us

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:16.959
and we might not even know

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.399
what He's protecting us from.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:21.999
We're completely blinded and oblivious to it.

00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:25.079
There are times in which He will allow us

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:29.639
to see how He was protecting us.

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.839
But I see here with Abram,

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.839
and we understand again the things

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.159
that we dealt with last week

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:36.919
as we finish up the 14th chapter

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:39.239
and how Abram is receiving that revelation

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:40.199
from Melchizedek,

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:42.159
understanding that God,

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:44.879
remember we said that He's the Most High God.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.799
He's the possessor of heaven and earth.

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:49.199
The first times that those truths

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.279
are given in the Word of God

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.439
and now God comes and in this vision

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:55.759
as He's speaking to Abram,

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.359
He says, I am thy shield.

00:15:58.359 --> 00:16:01.359
And that's encouraging.

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:04.559
This evening,

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:07.679
we need to be reminded and comforted

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:10.559
in knowing that He is our protector.

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:12.759
We often speak about the shepherd,

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:15.599
and someone said this recently,

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.719
I don't know much about my responsibilities.

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:21.599
He was a pastor and speaking about

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:23.439
the responsibilities of the under-shepherd.

00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:24.839
He said, but I know as an under-shepherd

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.919
I'm supposed to protect.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.239
And that is a responsibility.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.679
And you understand that as you look

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:33.719
at the truth when the psalmist says to us

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:34.799
there in Psalm 23,

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.159
the Lord is my shepherd,

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:38.719
and you go through the portion of Scripture

00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:41.439
and you rejoice in that very familiar passage,

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:43.599
you understand that the shepherd,

00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:45.399
it's not only the provision,

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:48.839
but it's the protection of the shepherd.

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:51.679
And I'm so thankful that He is our shield.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.959
Notice back in Genesis 15.

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.599
Not only does God appear to Abram

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.039
and say, fear not.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:02.159
Listen, Abram, you do not need to be fearful.

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:04.119
You don't need to have that spirit of fear.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.599
Fear not, Abram.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.199
Here's why.

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:08.919
I am thy shield.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:10.479
And then He says this,

00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:16.599
and thy exceeding great reward.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:20.039
Now when we think about that phraseology,

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.879
and we think about it within the context

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:24.039
of what has happened,

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:26.279
you remember as I mentioned to you

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.879
last Sunday evening,

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:30.639
that the King of Sodom came

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:31.839
and He said to Abram,

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:36.399
give Me the persons and take the goods.

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:38.439
And we find that Abram then said back

00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:40.079
to the King of Sodom,

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.439
he says, I have lift up mine hand

00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:44.879
unto the Lord, the Most High God,

00:17:44.879 --> 00:17:47.919
the Possessor of heaven and earth.

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:48.679
What did He say?

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:50.119
I'm not going to take anything from you

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:51.639
that I will not take from a thread

00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:53.079
even to a shoelatchet,

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:54.719
that I will not take anything

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:57.559
that is thine lest thou shouldst say

00:17:57.599 --> 00:17:59.479
I have made Abram rich.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.759
And we dealt with that last week.

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:02.279
Thoroughly dealt with that.

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.799
But we come to chapter 15,

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:04.719
and of course, we understand

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:06.919
chapter divisions were put in after, right?

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.559
And so really it's a continuation.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.079
It's ease of us being able

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:13.239
to find our place in the Scriptures.

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:16.239
But in that context of Abram

00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:18.599
rejecting that which Sodom,

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.079
the King of Sodom, had offered him,

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:22.999
God appears to him and says,

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:26.479
fear not, I am thy shield,

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:30.559
I am thy exceeding great reward.

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.639
See, the King of Sodom

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:33.200
was trying to make that deal

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.000
and trying to give him those things.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.239
You can keep the goods.

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.679
I want the people.

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:41.159
And Abram had gone out

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:42.959
and of course, he brought everything back.

00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:45.719
And so in customary,

00:18:45.719 --> 00:18:46.679
in that particular time,

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:48.359
certainly could have kept all of it.

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:49.760
But we find that he said,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.639
no, I don't need it.

00:18:50.639 --> 00:18:52.639
And God then comes and says,

00:18:52.639 --> 00:18:53.919
I am thy reward,

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:57.119
thy exceeding great reward.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:18:59.119
And we think about this.

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:01.200
No doubt this evening,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.799
God rewards his children.

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.000
No doubt.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.599
In fact, a verse that we've quoted often this year

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:10.159
with regard to our theme

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:12.880
and the subject matter of Hebrews 11 in particular,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.000
without faith, it is impossible to please him

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.440
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.519
and that he is a rewarder of them

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.679
that diligently seek him.

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:24.440
So we understand that God rewards his children,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.159
but can I tell you that this truth,

00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:30.079
we must grasp with our minds this evening,

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:33.880
that he is our reward.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.599
He says, I, it says,

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.440
I am thy shield

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.159
and thy exceeding great reward.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.000
That I am his and he is mine.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.760
Can you imagine that this evening?

00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:52.440
And remember, contextually,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:57.320
what the enemy wanted to offer Abram.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.880
I'm going to give you these goods,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.200
but just give me the people.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.600
and he says no I've lift up my hand unto the Lord the Most High God the

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.520
Possessor of heaven and earth and we find that yes he is the Possessor of

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.840
heaven and earth but then he says to Abram more than being the Possessor of

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.800
heaven earth I want you to understand I am thy exceeding great reward do you

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:27.280
know how precious it is that God is your father I mean sometimes we just we trust

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.640
that Christ is our Savior and we just yeah I'm a child of God and maybe we

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:40.720
don't pause and really just allow it to really grip our souls that God's hand of

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.240
favor and God's blessing and all of those things that he's bestowed upon us

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.920
those are great I'm thankful for them the psalmist said he daily loaded me

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.720
with benefits and he does but he is my exceeding great reward that I can enter

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.800
into his presence we sang tonight in the garden Terry with him you know God

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.160
never says your times up you ever have a meeting the person you're meeting with

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.580
they make it kind of obvious it's time for you to leave your appointments over

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.280
your times up they have something else to deal with that never happens with God

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:21.840
we're not on a timer with God he is our reward and this evening we understand as

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.960
I dealt with last year in in great detail in the book of Ephesians when

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.000
Paul is is given great truth of the church at Ephesus and understanding the

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
fact that that we have an inheritance and we do and Peter deals with the

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.160
inheritance but we understand that forever and ever people talk about what

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.560
is heaven gonna be like and what are all of these things gonna be like the fact

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:50.120
that I'm gonna be with my Redeemer for all of eternity I understand the streets

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.600
of gold I understand all of that which comes with it but the reality this

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.720
evening is that God says to Abram I am thy shield and by exceeding great

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.720
reward and as God would reveal these truths to Abram in Genesis 15 in verse

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.160
number one I can't help but consider as I've titled the message this evening a

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.280
memorable greeting can you imagine I mean later on I understand there are

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.240
many you could say well memorable greeting number one number two number

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.400
three because there's a lot of times that God speaks to Abram and there's

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.000
some amazing things when he reveals himself as being El Shaddai the Lord God

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.600
Almighty I mean what a powerful truth but I wonder this evening if we can put

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:48.160
ourselves in Abram's shoes just for a moment tonight and if we can be there in

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:57.720
those circumstances and hear those words from God fear not I am thy shield and I

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:06.560
exceeding great reward Abram I'm all that you need I'll take care of you

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.600
Abram I am the God of the universe the possessor of heaven and earth he's

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:17.680
revealed himself that way just a few verses before in this evening as the

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.320
people of God as the children of God as we look at the whole of Scripture and we

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.480
understand that we've been adopted in the family of God what a joy to know

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:37.360
that we don't have to fear why because he's our shield my buckler he's my

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:45.280
protector the protection as a father as a husband I understand the the role and

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.080
the desire to want to protect my family we understand that God is able to do so

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.880
much greater and I just sit back and I just rejoice that God is my shield he's

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.880
my protector and therefore I don't need to fear and he's my exceeding great

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:13.680
reward this evening someone has said this I don't know who said it when all

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.080
you have is Jesus you find out all you really need is Jesus what I'd say to you

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.279
this evening is that there are times in this world that we get so influenced by

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:29.360
those around us that we think that we need to get things to bring some kind of

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.720
satisfaction but understanding tonight that God is our exceeding great reward I

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:42.880
don't need anything but him and when I have him and I do because I'm his child

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.000
I have everything that I need the New Testament the Bible tells us that he's

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.840
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places he's given us all

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.760
things that pertain unto life and godliness he's blessed us immeasurably

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.080
but let us not get our eyes strictly on the blessings but on the one who gives

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:09.600
the blessings amen because he's my God he's my shield he's my exceeding great

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:16.320
reward what a greeting I can't help but think the context of Genesis 15 I

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.360
couldn't preach it all this evening but the context of Genesis 15 is powerful

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:27.440
and to just think about those words in this greeting this introduction to this

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.279
chapter how it must have impacted and influenced Abram and how it must have

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:40.000
comforted him and this evening I hope that we'd understand God knows where we

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.320
are he knows what we're dealing with he knows what we're going through he knows

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.200
what the circumstances of life are but he still comes and says fear not for I

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:57.960
am thy shield and I exceeding great reward father we love you we thank you

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:04.840
for loving us thank you for the Word of God the truth that is contained therein

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:12.360
divine revelation as we study this book of Genesis we see many references

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:22.840
first principle first mentioned principles God I'm so thankful that you

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.000
saw the state the condition of your servant Abram and their vision you spoke

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.080
to him he gave them these powerful truths and this evening by way of

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.600
extension as we understand that just as you were Abram's shield that you're our

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:49.800
shield you're our protector there are helper our God just as you were his

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.960
exceeding great reward what a joy to know as the songwriter said I am his and

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:05.720
he is mine now I belong to Jesus so thankful for what was made possible at

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:13.520
Calvary God I pray this evening that you would help each of us to be

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:21.240
satisfied with Jesus to understand that nothing is going to bring peace like you

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:29.920
will help us to yes rejoice and thank you for the blessings but help us not to

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.680
be so focused upon the blessings that we forget about the one giving the

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:40.480
blessings and understanding that you are our great exceeding great reward as

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.680

many circumstances that your people are facing but to just rest and knowing that

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.920
you're aware of it I pray God that you'd work well thank you for it in

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.200
Christ's name we pray we just and
