1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last week, we looked at this same portion of Scripture.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is part two.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And if you were here last week,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and if you weren't here last week, it's online,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you'll get part one before you get part two,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and go and listen to it.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But last week, we noted how that the psalmist

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
expressed his love for the word of God.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we looked through Psalm 119,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we noted several reasons that led to the psalmist

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
declaring his love for the Bible.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I believe this morning that each and every one of us,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
every child of God, ought to echo the words of the psalmist,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that we too would stand as the psalmist does in Psalm 119,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in verse number 97, and say,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
O how love I thy law!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
God's word is precious, and we ought to love it.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We ought to thank God for it.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And the reality is that as we've studied for several weeks now

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the truth regarding the Bible,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and how God gave us the Bible,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
our theme is great is the Lord,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and we discover God's greatness in a number of ways,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but we said that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We said that preservation reveals the greatness of God.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And when we understand the truth of inspiration and preservation,

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we understand that we have a more sure word,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and we ought to stand and say, I love God's word.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And we find this morning that as we look at this portion of Scripture,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and we think about this declaration of the psalmist,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I wonder this morning, as we would think about the psalmist,

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and I gave preview to this last week,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but I wonder this morning if there would be sufficient evidence

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to support the claim.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
See, the reality is that the psalmist stands up and says,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
O how love I thy law!

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And each of us this morning could echo their words, those words,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but I wonder this morning if there would be sufficient evidence

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to support the claim.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I believe that as we look at the portion of Scripture in Psalm 119,

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and we'll look at a number of verses this morning,

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I find and I believe this morning that you will find and you will discover

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
an overwhelming amount of evidence

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that would support the claim of the psalmist.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
See, we can say anything.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can claim anything.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But there ought to be evidence that would support our claim.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want you to notice, we've looked at verse 97,

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but notice that verse 159,

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and we'll use this verse as a springboard into the message this morning,

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as we look at a number of verses from Psalm 119,

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but I want you to notice what the Bible says,

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what the psalmist declares in Psalm 119 in verse 97.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He says, O how love I thy law!

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It is my meditation all the day.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But notice in verse 159.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Notice what the psalmist says.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Notice the first phrase.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You'll understand as you study through the 119th Psalm

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that there are many words that the psalmist uses

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to define the same book, the Bible, the word of God,

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the portion of Scripture that they had.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course, they did not have the complete canon of Scripture.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He refers to it as thy word, thy precepts, thy testimonies,

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
thy statutes, and so on and so forth.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And you find here that the psalmist says,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, he's declared his love in verse 97.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In fact, we looked at a number of verses last week

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
in which he declares his love for the law of the Lord.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But now in verse 159, the psalmist says,

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That word consider is interesting,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and that word consider means this.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It means to see, to look at, to inspect, to perceive.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I want you to think about Psalm 119 and verse 159

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
when the psalmist says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's really saying this, inspect, look at, examine,

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
see my life, and consider my behavior

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and how my behavior supports my claim.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I will note as we study Psalm 119 this morning,

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
10 evidences from this portion of Scripture

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that I believe provide us with the evidence necessary

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to support the claim of the psalmist.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then I will challenge each of us this morning

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to examine our own lives.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As we'd come in here and say,

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I love the Bible, I love God's word.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I hope you would say that this morning.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I hope every single person would say,

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I love God's word, I love the Lord, and I love his word.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But is there evidence in my life,

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
is there evidence in your life that would support that claim?

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Notice with me, number one, if you're taking notes,

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
again, there's 10 of them.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was thinking about this this morning.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If I was praying this morning, I said,

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Man, if I just spend a couple of minutes on each appointment,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we're past our time.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And so I'm gonna try to get through it quickly this morning.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I do hope that it'll be a blessing to you.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And notice with me, number one, this morning,

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the psalmist has a desire to learn the word.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Listen, if you love God's word,

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you ought to have a desire to learn God's word.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And we find here that the psalmist,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
look in verse number seven,

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and again, we'll just kind of march through Psalm 119,

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and we'll look at a number of verses of Scripture.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But notice what the Bible says.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Verse 12 says, Blessed art thou, O Lord.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Notice where he says a very simple prayer.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Teach me thy statutes.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why does the psalmist over and over throughout the Psalm,

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
in fact, if you look at verse 26, he says,

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have declared my ways and thou heardest me.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Teach me thy statutes.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And you'll find repeated on a number of occasions

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in Psalm 119 where the psalmist says,

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
teach me thy statutes, teach me thy law, teach me thy word.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why does the psalmist desire to learn?

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, because he loves the word of God.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He loves the Bible.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And if we love the Bible,

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we ought to have a desire to learn what it says.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Amen.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And we desire to learn.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And we find that the psalmist has expressed to us

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in this Psalm, this desire to learn.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And we find that in the New Testament,

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the Bible says that we desire the sincere milk of the word,

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that we may grow thereby.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It says this in 1 Peter 2, in verse number two,

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that ye may grow thereby.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And the reality this morning is that we don't just desire

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that milk of the word as newborn babes,

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but as we develop that appetite for God's word,

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we come to the place where we say, I desire to learn.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I want to learn God's word.

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, every day of your life, every day of my life,

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
God will teach us his statutes.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He will teach us his word.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And we need to have that teachable spirit.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In fact, I believe this morning that if we love God's word,

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that we will have a desire to learn the word of God.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Notice with me, number two, not only a desire to learn,

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but number two, a commitment to obey.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A commitment to obey the word of God.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Listen, it's important to learn,

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
but learning without obedience is really not of any use.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We find that the Bible teaches us that we are to be doers

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of the word and not hearers only.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The idea of learning the Bible and learning the word of God

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is not so that we can win some Bible trivia game.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not so that we can just have a bunch of knowledge

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and be puffed up.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, the idea of learning the Bible,

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
learning the word of God, is to obey it.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And so we find that the psalmist has a desire

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to learn the word of God,

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but he also has a commitment to obey the word of God.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Notice with me in verse number eight of Psalm 119,

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the Bible says this,

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I will keep thy statutes.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, forsake me not utterly.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Notice in verse number 33 what the psalmist says,

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and I shall keep it unto the end.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We see in verse number 33,

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
both of these first two points that we've looked at

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
this morning where he says teach me,

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but then he says I shall keep it.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And this commitment to obey the word of God.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What I've mentioned about Samuel in the past

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
when he says speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The idea of that word here, it carries with it

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
if you were to study that word out,

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it means to hear with the intent of obeying.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It means to give heed with the purpose of obeying

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the message that we receive.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
See, as we come to a place of gathering,

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
as we have the opportunity four times a week

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
to gather together as the people of God

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and to learn the word of God

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and have a commitment to obey the word of God.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
By the way, we find that a church is responsible,

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a church is a body of believers called out assembly

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and we find that the pastor has been given

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the responsibility to preach the word.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If the word is not being taught, not a place I'd go.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Amen?

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Honestly, the Bible is to be taught.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It doesn't matter what my opinions are,

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
it doesn't matter all of those things,

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
but we need to be lifting up and exalting

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the Lord Jesus Christ and teaching this book

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and we find that as we come,

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
why do we pray before the services?

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We're praying, God, would you teach me?

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Would you work in my life?

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I come with this attitude of expectancy,

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
desiring to hear from God.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I often say this, that we need to be ready to receive,

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but also ready to respond.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,559
Lord, how would you speak to me through your Word today?

213
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,960
Maybe God spoke to you through a song already this morning.

214
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:17,000
And God just uses the songs that are based on scriptural truth, and He uses His Word

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,840
in our hearts and our lives, and we have that commitment to obey the Word of God.

216
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,879
Number three this morning, the psalmist has a plan to memorize the Word of God.

217
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,520
He has a plan to memorize the Word of God.

218
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Why would I memorize it?

219
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,479
Well, because I love it.

220
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:40,599
And if I love the Bible, if I love God's Word, then I memorize God's Word, and memorizing

221
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,799
is evidence that I do love it.

222
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,560
Notice what he says in verse number 11, a verse that's very familiar to many of us.

223
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:55,639
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

224
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,319
He's purposed.

225
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,040
He has a plan to memorize God's Word.

226
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,440
I know that oftentimes when we think about memorization, we think about the children,

227
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,440
we think about Sunday school, and we think about Awan and other children's ministries,

228
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,199
and the importance of hiding God's Word in their hearts and lives.

229
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:20,279
But I want you to understand that as the psalmist gives us this truth here, we find that because

230
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,080
he loves the Bible, because he loves the Word of God, he says, I'm going to hide His Word

231
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,160
in my heart.

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Every child of God ought to be memorizing God's Word.

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
You say, well, I just don't have that great of a memory.

234
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Ask God to help you.

235
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,839
I mean, listen, if you only memorize a verse a year, praise God for a verse that you memorized.

236
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,319
Amen?

237
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,879
I know sometimes we set goals, we say, man, I'm going to memorize a verse a week.

238
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,199
I'm going to memorize 52 verses this week, and we get into about week number eight or

239
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,319
ten of the year, and we can't remember any of the first seven, eight verses that we've

240
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,559
memorized, and we're just kind of a mess.

241
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,839
Listen, make goals that are achievable.

242
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,120
God, by your grace and with your help, I'll memorize a verse a year, a verse a month,

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,199
a verse a quarter, whatever it might be, but God, would you help me memorize your Word?

244
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,199
Why?

245
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,199
Because I love it.

246
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,440
I want you to think about what he says.

247
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,199
He says, I have, notice what he says, thy Word have I hid in mine heart, that I might

248
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,199
not sin against thee.

249
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,720
I think it's interesting he used that word that he's hid the Word.

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,399
He knows where it is.

251
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,119
It's in his heart.

252
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,119
He's purposed.

253
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:38,320
He's got this plan to memorize the Word of God.

254
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
Our children are memorizing verses.

255
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,600
I know that in Holly's class on Wednesday evening, they're working on memorization.

256
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,880
I know that the children's church that's even downstairs now, how often they come up and

257
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,399
they'll sing for us and they'll rehearse, recite verses of Scripture.

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
Man, that's wonderful.

259
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,919
But this morning, I wonder, am I memorizing God's Word?

260
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,320
Are you memorizing God's Word?

261
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,720
If I love it, I want to memorize it.

262
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Why?

263
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Because I want to be able to recall it.

264
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,000
When I've memorized God's Word, then I can recall it.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,759
Maybe in that moment of temptation as we find in the wilderness with the Lord Jesus Christ,

266
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,080
when that temptation comes, he's able to say, it is written.

267
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
That's a good read.

268
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,639
Look, he says that I might not sin against thee.

269
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,880
God provides that way of escape.

270
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,380
Oh, a plan to memorize.

271
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,240
He memorizes because he loves.

272
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,119
Notice with me number four, a plan not only to memorize, but a plan to meditate on the

273
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,119
Word.

274
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,160
A plan to meditate on the Word of God.

275
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,399
Notice in verse 15, I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways.

276
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,199
He says in verse 23, princes also did sit and speak against me, but thy servant did

277
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,139
meditate in thy statutes.

278
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,279
Of course, we're familiar with verse 97.

279
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,320
We've used that last week as our main verse of getting into this portion of scripture.

280
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,080
Oh, how love I thy law.

281
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,119
It is my meditation all the day.

282
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:11,380
And the psalmist says this in Psalm 119 verse 148, mine eyes prevent the night watches that

283
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,360
I might meditate in thy Word.

284
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,579
This thing of meditation is important.

285
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,540
We find often throughout the Psalms where you'll read this word selah, and you think

286
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,220
about that word selah, and oftentimes in our society today, many of us don't have time

287
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,859
for selah because we're in a hurry, and we're trying to get through things and trying to

288
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:35,459
get on to the next thing, and we got more things to do today than we could ever actually

289
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,179
accomplish today, and we're so task-oriented, we have so many things going on.

290
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:45,059
But the psalmist says, thy Word is my meditation.

291
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,640
He's got a plan to meditate on the Word of God.

292
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,059
That's why I believe it's important that we begin our day with reading the Bible.

293
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,059
And I understand that some people say, I'm just not a morning person, I don't get anything

294
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:59,940
out of it if I read it in the morning, and so I read it in the evening, and I say, good,

295
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,859
it's good that you read God's Word.

296
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,899
But we find this morning it's amazing to me that as we read the Word of God in the morning,

297
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,380
how it can be our meditation throughout the day, how we can take that time.

298
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,260
See, God says, be still and know that I am God.

299
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,019
We have a hard time being still, we have a hard time meditating on the Word of God.

300
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,619
See, today we live in a time in which things are so fast-paced, but then we also have the

301
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:29,179
other aspect where people are teaching and promoting this idea that meditation is getting

302
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,820
into some quiet place somewhere where you remove every thought from your mind and you're

303
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,700
just kind of in this moment of, mm, just nothing.

304
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
That's not real meditation.

305
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:46,779
And the psalmist says, what I'm going to meditate on is Your Word, it is my meditation.

306
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,380
You know, we're really good, you think about this idea of meditation and the word Selah,

307
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,779
just chewing on it, having it go over and just permeate our mind and just saturate our

308
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,779
minds.

309
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:07,019
And it's a wonderful thing to be thinking upon the truth of God's Word.

310
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,380
You know, somebody can offend us, somebody can hurt us, somebody can do us wrong and

311
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,459
all of a sudden that thing, that action, that comment just kind of replays in our head over

312
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:22,100
and over and over and over and over and over and we just begin to think about what that

313
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,140
person did and how they said and I can't believe and so on and so forth.

314
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,299
And it's just, oh, that's how we should have God's Word in our mind, just constantly replaying

315
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:38,220
in our heart and our mind, meditating on God's Word.

316
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,700
Notice with me number five, I find this evidence to support the claim of the psalmist that

317
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,380
he says, oh, how love I thy law.

318
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:56,179
I would say number five, the psalmist has the discipline to search the Word, to study.

319
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:00,140
Notice with me in verse number 94, notice what the Bible says.

320
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:08,859
He says, I am thine, save me for I have sought thy precepts.

321
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,059
The word sought there means to seek, but it doesn't just mean to seek, it means to seek

322
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,059
with care.

323
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,420
You ever look for something?

324
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,260
I mean, you're seeking for something.

325
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,619
You misplaced it.

326
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,059
Has that ever happened to anyone?

327
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,260
Come on.

328
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,380
And you're seeking for it, right?

329
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,220
And you're seeking with care, right?

330
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,100
You're diligent and you want to find that thing.

331
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:40,540
Well, here the Bible says that the psalmist says, I have sought thy precepts.

332
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,019
The idea of searching the scriptures, the idea of studying the scriptures, the Bible

333
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:49,380
says, study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

334
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,179
rightly dividing the word of truth.

335
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,260
The Bible says, as Jesus is dealing with some people during his earthly ministry, he said,

336
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,500
search the scriptures, for in them you think that you have eternal life, but they are they

337
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,459
which testify of me, in John chapter number five.

338
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:10,019
And the reality is that God's Word does testify of the Lord Jesus Christ.

339
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,859
Jesus started with those disciples on the road to Emmaus and Luke.

340
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,859
He started where?

341
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:19,140
With Moses and the prophets, and he expounded all things from the scriptures concerning

342
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,019
himself.

343
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:27,820
We find this morning that the psalmist, he says, I have sought thy precepts.

344
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,179
What makes the psalmist, what is it that motivates the psalmist?

345
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,820
What is the driving factor in the life of the psalmist that makes him search to seek

346
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,099
with care God's Word?

347
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,260
Well, he loves it.

348
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,619
He loves it.

349
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,460
And it's God's Word that reveals who God is.

350
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,859
You say, I'm so thankful that God is gracious.

351
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,500
How do you know that God is gracious?

352
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,539
Well, because he told us that he's gracious.

353
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:59,700
But I wonder this morning, if each of us had the responsibility, we were given a sheet

354
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,979
of paper, say, with a list of maybe 25 different attributes of God, I mean, attributes that

355
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:11,020
I think each and every one of us would agree to, attributes that each of us would be familiar

356
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,979
with, and we'd say, is God gracious?

357
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,380
Yes or no?

358
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Yes.

359
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,559
Give me a verse that proves it.

360
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,419
How many of us could put a verse down?

361
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,059
Is God merciful?

362
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,059
Yes or no?

363
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,059
Yes.

364
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:29,500
Give me a verse.

365
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,020
Did God ever sin?

366
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Yes or no?

367
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,059
No.

368
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,419
Give me a verse.

369
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:41,820
I'm not saying give me a verse like I'm the teacher, but I'm saying that's how we're supposed

370
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,859
to search the Scriptures, that we know it, not just that we know about the attributes

371
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:53,219
of God, but we know them, that we can get into this book and that we can say, I know

372
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:58,500
that God is great, and I know that God is gracious, and I know that God is merciful,

373
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,979
and I know that God is perfect.

374
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:04,539
I know that God, fill in the blank, because I have verses of Scripture, because I have

375
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,539
sought.

376
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:13,419
I've sought it, I've searched it, I've studied it, because I love the Bible.

377
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:18,419
So I would say this, as I mentioned the point, the discipline to search the Word, it requires

378
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,419
discipline.

379
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,299
It requires discipline.

380
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:27,739
It's easy to just hear somebody else tell us something, but the discipline for us ourselves

381
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:34,259
to go and to search and to study the Word of God.

382
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,139
I would say this, number six, the Bible tells us that the psalmist makes this declaration

383
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,579
that the Word of God was his delight.

384
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,059
Why was it his delight?

385
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,299
Well, because he loved it.

386
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:53,739
And the evidence of his love for God's Word was that it was his delight.

387
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:59,179
You know, it's kind of interesting if somebody says, I love, fill in the blank, maybe somebody

388
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,259
says they love their spouse, but they never spend time with their spouse.

389
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,579
You say, what's going on with that?

390
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:07,219
That's kind of weird, right?

391
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:10,859
If you love your spouse, you're going to spend time with your spouse.

392
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,059
I love the church, and you never can find them.

393
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,779
You say, how much do you really love the church?

394
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,779
You don't come.

395
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,779
You understand what I'm saying?

396
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,979
I love pizza, but I haven't eaten it in three years.

397
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,619
Well, how much do you really, I mean, you understand.

398
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:28,499
But the psalmist says, I love God's Word, and therefore God's Word is my delight.

399
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,299
The word delight means to affect with great pleasure, to bring joy.

400
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:36,939
Listen, I hope this morning that God's Word brings joy in your life.

401
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:41,619
When you read it this morning, even as I mentioned last week, that God's Word all at the same

402
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:44,099
time will convict us and comfort us.

403
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,059
It's amazing, this book that we hold in our hands, that we're privileged to have.

404
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,819
Notice in verse number 16, notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 119 and verse 16.

405
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:59,299
The Bible says this, I will delight myself in thy statutes.

406
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,819
Then he says this, I will not forget thy word.

407
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,139
That's an interesting statement, is it not?

408
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:08,019
In fact, there are many times within the psalm, this psalm, that he says something about not

409
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,579
forgetting thy word, thy statutes, and that's an interesting statement.

410
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:17,379
But I believe that as he would meditate upon the truth that God had given him, it will

411
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:21,059
help him not to forget it.

412
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,179
But I want you to see that he says, I will delight myself in thy statutes.

413
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:33,739
He says again in verse number 24, thy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.

414
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,699
What is it that brings you joy?

415
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:39,059
What is it that brings you satisfaction?

416
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,179
What is it that brings you pleasure?

417
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:49,759
There are some today that based upon a particular team that they follow, having success brings

418
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,139
them a measure of joy, brings them a measure of delight.

419
00:22:55,139 --> 00:23:01,379
I remember speaking to a man years ago, and he was dealing with a problem with alcohol,

420
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,459
and I remember having this conversation with this individual and asking him, what is it

421
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,459
that caused him to drink?

422
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,859
And here's what he said to me.

423
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:14,859
He said the team that he followed lost, and I thought, what in the world?

424
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:19,019
I mean, it just, that's how it hit me.

425
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,979
But the team that he followed lost, and he turned to the bottle because he was looking

426
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:31,819
for some joy, some pleasure, some satisfaction in a victory, by the way, that doesn't even

427
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:36,499
matter in light of eternity.

428
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:43,539
This morning, the psalmist says, thy word, thy testimonies are my delight.

429
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,779
Not only are they my delight, they're my counselors.

430
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,899
And I wonder this morning, would we say that God's word brings joy in our lives?

431
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:58,499
He says in verse 47, notice, and I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved,

432
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,179
which I have loved.

433
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:05,379
Look over at verse 174, there's a number of other ones, but we'll just kind of skip around

434
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,379
here.

435
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:13,419
And he says, nearing the end of this psalm, he says in verse number 174, I have longed

436
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:20,979
for thy salvation, O Lord, and thy law is my delight.

437
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:21,979
It is my delight.

438
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:25,579
What did the psalmist say in Psalm chapter number 1?

439
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:26,859
We are familiar with this psalm.

440
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,539
The Bible says, blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth

441
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:38,659
in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in

442
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:46,339
the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

443
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:52,099
And God's word is his delight because he loves it, and when he makes the statement that it's

444
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:59,659
his delight, when we read and we look at his behavior, we find that it being the Bible,

445
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:05,299
the Scriptures, the commandments, the testimony being his delight gives evidence that he loves

446
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,339
God's word.

447
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,579
Number seven, he longed for God's word.

448
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,719
He longed for God's word.

449
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:24,219
Notice in verse number 125 of this psalm, back in Psalm 119, and notice verse 125, notice

450
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:32,499
what he says, I am thy servant, give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.

451
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:39,019
I want you to think about this idea of longing for the testimonies, and he says that I may

452
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,519
know.

453
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,019
He says give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies, and we think about this longing

454
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,019
for God's word.

455
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,979
Have you ever been in a time, in a place where maybe you had an emergency come up, there's

456
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:57,539
something that took place and your day was interrupted and you were not able to start

457
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,619
and follow your, maybe your routine of getting into the Bible first thing in the morning

458
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:07,219
because of some emergency that came up, and man, it's happened to me.

459
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:11,939
I've gotten phone calls before from some members that have dealt with some difficulties, some

460
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:15,659
health things or whatever it's been, and I need to go to the hospital first thing in

461
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,379
the morning, and it's just kind of affected my schedule.

462
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,379
It happens.

463
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:30,579
I'll find myself in the afternoon, I can't wait to get to my time with God.

464
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:34,019
I long to read the Bible.

465
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,779
I'm longing for God's word.

466
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,699
See, have you ever skipped a meal?

467
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,339
I mean physically, you've skipped a meal.

468
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,179
We're down there in South Carolina, and I think it was on Tuesday or Wednesday, we didn't

469
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,179
have any lunch.

470
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:55,139
I think it was Tuesday, and Holly looked at me and she said, I'm hungry.

471
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,619
She said, I just need some meat.

472
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,619
That's what mommy said.

473
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,859
No, she never says she needs meat.

474
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,019
In fact, there's been times we've gone out to dinner and she orders a veggie plate.

475
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,579
I said, what is a veggie plate?

476
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,299
You get to pick five veggies.

477
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,299
No thank you.

478
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,739
I pick five meats, I'm for it, amen?

479
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:12,939
But she picked five veggies, you know?

480
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:13,939
And she said, I'm hungry.

481
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:14,939
Why?

482
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:15,939
Because we skipped a meal.

483
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,539
She's ready for dinner.

484
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,979
Listen, if you skip a meal, you get a reminder.

485
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,619
Your body reminds you.

486
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,859
You skip several meals, your body reminds you.

487
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:32,779
I wonder this morning how it is if our time with God is delayed for some reason.

488
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:39,159
Our ability to read and to get into the Bible is interrupted because of something that happens

489
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,159
in life.

490
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,699
And I understand there are interruptions, there are times in which we cannot control

491
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:44,699
those circumstances.

492
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:46,699
Now, there are times in which we can.

493
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,299
There are times in which we can say, no, I'm not going to deal with that right now because

494
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,059
I am spending time with God.

495
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,339
But there are times that we just can't do that.

496
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,459
Do you understand what I'm saying?

497
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:55,459
It happens in life.

498
00:27:55,459 --> 00:28:00,059
But if that happens, I wonder, do we long for it?

499
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,539
Are we anxious to get to our time with God and His Word?

500
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,299
Do we long for God?

501
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,619
Do we long for His Word?

502
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,299
I would say this, He valued God's Word, number eight.

503
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,099
He valued God's Word.

504
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:19,059
The Bible tells us in verse number 128, He says this, He says, Therefore, I esteem all

505
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:24,459
thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way.

506
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:25,979
Verse 127, excuse me.

507
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:34,380
He says, Therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.

508
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,139
I used this verse of Scripture last week and I mentioned that many people today love gold.

509
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:41,299
They do.

510
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,739
They love gold.

511
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:45,539
Gold represents wealth.

512
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,500
We find that many people love, and many people will go through great lengths in order to

513
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,739
obtain wealth, in order to obtain some status, and we find here that the psalmist says, no,

514
00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:03,500
I want you to understand that I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold, and because

515
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:11,820
I love thy commandments above gold, above fine gold, therefore, I esteem all thy precepts

516
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,459
concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way.

517
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:23,059
And so we see these two verses together, and we see verse 128 where He says about esteeming

518
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,059
the Word of God.

519
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,019
I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things.

520
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:33,979
And we know that Job, he mentioned about esteeming the Word of God, and as we think about that

521
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:39,579
Word of esteem, and we dealt with this last week, and we focused upon the truth of that,

522
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:44,820
and thinking about the place that we, the emphasis and the place that we have on God's

523
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,979
Word.

524
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:46,979
We esteem it.

525
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:49,500
We value it.

526
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,659
We find here that the psalmist says because of his love for God's Word, he's going to

527
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,739
esteem, but notice what he says.

528
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:59,339
I love how he words this in verse number 128.

529
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,099
He says, I esteem.

530
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:05,099
all thy precepts concerning all things.

531
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,699
Now that's pretty conclusive, all-inclusive, excuse me.

532
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:11,819
I mean, he's including it all, right?

533
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:15,939
He's saying I love all thy precepts.

534
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,499
Not just certain ones, I'm not just picking certain ones.

535
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:20,799
You ever go to a buffet?

536
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,319
You go to a buffet and what do you do?

537
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,379
Well, there's certain things you like

538
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,019
and there's certain things you don't like.

539
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,219
And you go heavy on the things that you like

540
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:31,259
and you skip over the things that you don't like.

541
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:33,719
Right, isn't that how it works at a buffet?

542
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:37,039
You pick and choose, correct?

543
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,939
That's not how we approach God's Word.

544
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,259
We don't approach God's Word

545
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,979
the way that we approach a buffet.

546
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,499
We don't approach God's Word with saying,

547
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:48,459
well, I really like this, but nah, that's not really for me.

548
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,579
I've heard people say today, many times over the years,

549
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,019
I've heard people make the statement,

550
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,419
well, you know, the Old Testament

551
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,619
really isn't for us anymore.

552
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,979
You know how much you miss?

553
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:01,099
You know how much you miss?

554
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,379
By the way, the New Testament says of the Old Testament

555
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,339
that it was written for our admonition.

556
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,899
That's what he says.

557
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:12,059
Not only for our admonition, but also for our learning.

558
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:13,779
Wow.

559
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:18,179
Groups of people that just remove it.

560
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,859
There's a popular preacher, Andy Stanley.

561
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,399
Popular man, wrong man.

562
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:29,819
You know what he said about the Old Testament?

563
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,579
We need to unhitch from the Old Testament.

564
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,779
That's what he said about the Old Testament.

565
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,139
And now you begin to look at some of their teaching,

566
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:40,459
there's no wonder that they unhitch

567
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:43,919
not only from the Old Testament, but from all of God's Word.

568
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,999
Seriously, it's a disaster.

569
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,299
This morning, the psalmist says,

570
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,419
I esteem all thy precepts.

571
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:57,419
Notice what he says, concerning all things.

572
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:58,899
Wow.

573
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:04,939
God addresses the issues of life in His Word.

574
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,339
He does.

575
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:13,339
God uses His Word to address the issues of life.

576
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,899
And the psalmist says, I esteem all thy precepts

577
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,899
concerning all things, notice what he says, to be right.

578
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,139
Now that's important that we understand that.

579
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,059
Why, because your opinion's not right,

580
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,019
my opinion's not right, our culture's not right.

581
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,379
Now if it's right, it's only because

582
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,879
it aligns with God's Word.

583
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:40,619
Because God's Word is what is right.

584
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,599
And the psalmist says that he esteems all thy precepts

585
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,219
concerning all things to be right.

586
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,219
You think about some of the all things.

587
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,339
I mean, again, that's encompassing.

588
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,499
Everything that we would face in life,

589
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,379
the Bible says this, that we're to keep our hearts

590
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,979
with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

591
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,499
In Proverbs chapter number four.

592
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:03,019
And you think about all things that we'd face.

593
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,339
Today there are questions about all sorts of things

594
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,099
that say, well, what does God's Word say?

595
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,219
Because I esteem that all thy precepts

596
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:15,799
concerning all things to be right.

597
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,139
We're not gonna discard God's Word.

598
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,439
We're not gonna say, well, you know, times have changed

599
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,519
and things are different now

600
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,959
and we need to be more open-minded

601
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,799
and we need to be more inclusive

602
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,799
and we need to be, no, no, no, no.

603
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,819
We need to be biblically correct.

604
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,479
I know that's not popular today.

605
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,919
I understand that.

606
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,739
I do not have my head in the sand.

607
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,999
But we must be biblically accurate.

608
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:46,879
We must be biblically correct.

609
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:50,519
You know, it'd be a sad thing to conform to this world

610
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:55,719
and forsake God's Word and then stand before Him one day.

611
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,279
I don't wanna do that.

612
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,439
I don't wanna do that.

613
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,879
So the psalmist says that he values,

614
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,879
he esteems all thy precepts

615
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,399
concerning all things to be right.

616
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,779
Notice the Bible tells us, number nine,

617
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:19,319
if you're taking notes, that he stood in awe of God's Word.

618
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,239
It means to revere it.

619
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,239
In verse number 161,

620
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,359
it says, princes have persecuted me without a cause,

621
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:35,279
but my heart standeth in awe of thy Word.

622
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,599
Well, this morning, how much do we revere God's Word?

623
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,519
Have we come to that place where we're standing in awe

624
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,599
of what God has given us in His Word?

625
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 138,

626
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,639
in verse number two, he says,

627
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,619
I will worship toward thy holy temple

628
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,839
and praise thy name for thy loving kindness

629
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,919
and for thy truth, for thou hast magnified thy Word

630
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,879
above all thy name.

631
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:06,139
Listen, we ought to stand in awe of who God is.

632
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:10,399
We find that the psalmist declares that in Psalm 34.

633
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,999
The Bible teaches us, excuse me, Psalm 33,

634
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:15,079
in verse number eight, let all the earth fear the Lord.

635
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,479
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

636
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,419
We ought to stand in awe of God,

637
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:23,619
but we ought to stand in awe of His Word to revere it.

638
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,239
We find number 10, that the psalmist,

639
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,759
what evidence do we have to support the claim?

640
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,599
Oh, how love I thy law.

641
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,439
Really?

642
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,159
Really, you love the law of the Lord?

643
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,559
You love God's Word?

644
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,159
He says, yes, I love it, and consider how I love it.

645
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:50,319
We find number 10, that he purposed to speak God's Word.

646
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,719
He purposed to speak God's Word.

647
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,159
Notice in verse 172 of Psalm 119,

648
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,519
the Bible says this in verse 172,

649
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:05,119
my tongue shall speak of thy Word

650
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,639
for all thy commandments are righteousness.

651
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,559
My tongue shall speak of thy Word.

652
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,359
See, he loved God's Word, and he meditated upon God's Word,

653
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,599
and all of these other things that we've looked at,

654
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,319
and it leads to him saying,

655
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:27,599
I'm purposed to speak of God's Word.

656
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,999
Look over at Psalm 37.

657
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:30,319
We studied this for those that are

658
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:33,099
in our Wednesday evening prayer and Bible study here

659
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,999
that are not in some other class.

660
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:37,399
We studied this, but if you're in another class,

661
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,799
I wanna draw your attention to this

662
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,079
and remind those that were here for that message,

663
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,519
this truth in Psalm 37.

664
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,879
Notice what the Bible says in verse 30

665
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,719
and also in verse number 31.

666
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,319
Again, the psalmist is saying

667
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,159
that he's purposed to speak the Word.

668
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,279
It says in verse number 30 of Psalm 37,

669
00:36:56,279 --> 00:37:00,079
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,

670
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,079
and his tongue talketh of judgment.

671
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,719
Why does he speak the way that he does?

672
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,959
Well, the answer is found in verse 31,

673
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,759
the law of his God is in his heart.

674
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,759
The law of his God is in his heart.

675
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:17,039
So no wonder his mouth is going to speak of wisdom

676
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,659
and his tongue is going to talk of judgment

677
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:23,519
because God's Word, his law is in his heart.

678
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,279
And it's in his heart because he loves it.

679
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,199
Remember the point that we looked at

680
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,559
that he had a plan to memorize God's Word.

681
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,999
He said, oh, how love I thy law,

682
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:37,039
but we find that as we study through Psalm 119,

683
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,839
we see all of these evidences that are provided to us,

684
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,119
scattered through this psalm,

685
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,199
that help us to see how the psalmist,

686
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,319
there's overwhelming evidence to support the claim

687
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,359
that he loves God's Word.

688
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:59,279
And this morning, I wonder in my life,

689
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,079
I wonder in your life,

690
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,119
I wonder if we were to take the time this morning

691
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,839
to just evaluate our own lives

692
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,079
and looking over just the last week or the last month

693
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,719
or maybe just this calendar year,

694
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:18,039
these two and a half months that we've had in 2023

695
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,839
and say, is there evidence in my life

696
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:26,919
that would support the claim that I love God's Word,

697
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:29,799
that I love God's Word?

698
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,339
See, the evidence is overwhelming

699
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:35,979
in support for what the psalmist declared,

700
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,619
the expression of his love,

701
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,059
but the evidence of his love.

702
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:46,139
I'm gonna read to you an account of an individual,

703
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:48,139
his name is William McPherson,

704
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,359
and some of you may have heard of this individual

705
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,699
at some point,

706
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,500
but this man was a superintendent of a stone quarry,

707
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,819
and as he was working there

708
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:59,779
and he was successful in his work and what have you,

709
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,859
he's working, obviously working in a stone quarry,

710
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,819
there's some danger that's there,

711
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:07,419
and he had, unfortunately, there was a blast

712
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,099
that took place at this stone quarry,

713
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,299
and he was in the wrong place,

714
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,339
and he was severely injured.

715
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,779
Through this blast and through this injury,

716
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,699
this man lost his eyesight

717
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:21,159
and both of his hands in the explosion.

718
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:26,779
I want you to think about being in that position.

719
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:32,579
No eyesight, no hands.

720
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,599
I'm thankful that for folks that are blind,

721
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,579
there's Braille.

722
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,459
In fact, you can get Braille Bibles.

723
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,579
They have those.

724
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,699
And someone that's blind can still have the opportunity

725
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:51,139
to, with a Braille Bible, read the Bible.

726
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,259
In fact, some of you might know the name of Don Forrester.

727
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,139
He was a pastor down in Fredericksburg

728
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,339
at Faith Baptist Church for a number of years.

729
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:00,179
And I remember the first time

730
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:05,419
ever heard him preach was on a CD and I had no idea that he was blind. I'd never met the

731
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:10,739
man before and somebody as soon as I got to Virginia gave me a CD of his because I was

732
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,279
taking a trip to the Grand Canyon and said, hey, Brother Forster preached about his trip

733
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,139
to the Grand Canyon, why don't you listen to this on the way? And I did and I had no

734
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:22,059
idea that he was blind. And I'm hearing him talk about all these things and then I find

735
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:26,619
out that he's blind and it was very interesting as somebody would have to detail things to

736
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:32,759
him and explain things and so on and so forth. But then I heard him preach in person. Phenomenal.

737
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:37,539
Has anyone ever, you've ever been in a setting where Don Forster preached? My dad, anyone

738
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,859
else? He stands up there, he's completely blind and he has, and he just, he uses his

739
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:55,019
hand right here and I mean, it's phenomenal. But this man lost both of his hands. No eyesight,

740
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:04,359
no hands. But this man, William McPherson, was determined to read the Bible. He was determined

741
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:13,059
to read the Bible. So here's what he did. He learned how to read raised letters with

742
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:24,779
the tip of his tongue. He learned how to read raised letters with the tip of his tongue.

743
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:35,619
It is said that William McPherson read through the Bible four times with the tip of his tongue.

744
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:42,539
That's phenomenal. That's phenomenal. But that's the testimony of somebody that said,

745
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:49,779
I love God's Word. And though I've lost my eyesight and though I've lost my hands, I

746
00:41:49,779 --> 00:42:01,779
want to read God's Word. Unfortunately, surveys have been taken for years now. Surveys, I'm

747
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:09,059
not sure who they survey, but surveys have been taken for years of people that claim

748
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,339
to be Christians. And again, I say claim to be because I don't know who they're surveying.

749
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,939
They ask the question how often they read their Bibles. They ask the question of how

750
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:24,500
many have read their Bible through once, not just in a year, but in their lifetime. And

751
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:33,459
consistently those statistics are sad as to how few ever read the Bible from Genesis

752
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:39,139
to Revelation. I'm not talking about, and again, I don't know the people, so I don't

753
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:44,939
know if they're saved. They claim to be Christians. But here's a man that's lost his eyesight

754
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:53,899
in both of his hands and it's said that four times with the tip of his tongue he read the

755
00:42:53,899 --> 00:43:02,459
Bible from cover to cover. And we can look at that and we say, that's amazing. That's

756
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:10,859
just the evidence of an individual that loves God's Word. What would cause him to have that

757
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:16,899
kind of love for God's Word? Well, he understood what it was. He understood that God's Word

758
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:22,619
was God's Word. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. He understood that it

759
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,659
had been preserved. He understood that it was profitable. He understood all that we've

760
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:35,419
looked at these past few weeks and he said, I need to read the Bible. And I'm not sure

761
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:40,919
how I'm going to be able to read it, but I need to read it. And he learned to read letters

762
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:48,099
with the tip of his tongue. Unbelievable. Amazing. But the evidence of a man that loved

763
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:56,459
God's Word. This morning we've looked at ten things from Psalm 119 that I believe, and

764
00:43:56,459 --> 00:44:03,259
I think you could find more, but I believe they reveal to us, they provide for us evidence

765
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:11,439
that supports the claim when the psalmist says, oh how love I thy law. It is my meditation

766
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:22,059
all the day. Because we can make any claim we want, but is there evidence to support

767
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:28,539
the claim? I believe this morning that the answer to that question for the psalmist would

768
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:36,940
be yes. Absolutely there is evidence that supports the claim that the psalmist expressed

769
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:42,220
when he said, I love God's Word. But what about our lives? What about my life? What

770
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:48,979
about your life? Is the evidence there? Does the evidence support the claim? I love God's

771
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:55,419
Word. I love God's Word. Those ten things, I'm not going to repeat them, but I do want

772
00:44:55,419 --> 00:45:01,179
you to evaluate your own life. Ask the Lord to help us this morning. Do I really love

773
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:08,220
God's Word? Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

774
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,779
the testimony of the psalmist and as we've noted last week how he expressed his love

775
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:21,019
for thy Word. We looked at a number of reasons that led to his declaration as to why he would

776
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:27,019
say, oh how love I thy law. But now this morning as we look at the evidence that supports the

777
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:35,820
claim. God I pray that you would help each of us this morning to evaluate our own lives.

778
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:43,380
That we would examine our own lives and we would be honest in our evaluation. That we

779
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:52,859
would be humble in our evaluation. I say that I love God's Word. But is the evidence

780
00:45:52,859 --> 00:46:02,059
there to support the claim? We thank you for the testimony of Mr. McPherson. No doubt he

781
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:09,739
loved thy Word. And God I pray that through your Word this morning you would cause us

782
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:16,739
to have a greater appreciation for your Word, a greater love for your Word. That the evidence

783
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:26,220
would be just so obvious in our lives that even others that would look at us and say

784
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:33,220
man they must really love the Bible. They love God's Word. They're always talking about

785
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:41,779
it. Lord I pray that you would help us this morning. Work in hearts and lives as only

786
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:46,339
you can. We'll thank you for the work that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray.
