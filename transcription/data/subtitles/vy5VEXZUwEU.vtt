00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last week, we looked at this same portion of Scripture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is part two.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And if you were here last week,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and if you weren't here last week, it's online,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you'll get part one before you get part two,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and go and listen to it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But last week, we noted how that the psalmist

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
expressed his love for the word of God.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And we looked through Psalm 119,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we noted several reasons that led to the psalmist

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
declaring his love for the Bible.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I believe this morning that each and every one of us,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
every child of God, ought to echo the words of the psalmist,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that we too would stand as the psalmist does in Psalm 119,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in verse number 97, and say,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
O how love I thy law!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
God's word is precious, and we ought to love it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We ought to thank God for it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the reality is that as we've studied for several weeks now

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the truth regarding the Bible,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and how God gave us the Bible,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
our theme is great is the Lord,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we discover God's greatness in a number of ways,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but we said that inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We said that preservation reveals the greatness of God.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And when we understand the truth of inspiration and preservation,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we understand that we have a more sure word,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and we ought to stand and say, I love God's word.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And we find this morning that as we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we think about this declaration of the psalmist,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I wonder this morning, as we would think about the psalmist,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I gave preview to this last week,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but I wonder this morning if there would be sufficient evidence

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to support the claim.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
See, the reality is that the psalmist stands up and says,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
O how love I thy law!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And each of us this morning could echo their words, those words,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but I wonder this morning if there would be sufficient evidence

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to support the claim.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I believe that as we look at the portion of Scripture in Psalm 119,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and we'll look at a number of verses this morning,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I find and I believe this morning that you will find and you will discover

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
an overwhelming amount of evidence

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that would support the claim of the psalmist.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
See, we can say anything.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We can claim anything.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But there ought to be evidence that would support our claim.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I want you to notice, we've looked at verse 97,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but notice that verse 159,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and we'll use this verse as a springboard into the message this morning,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
as we look at a number of verses from Psalm 119,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but I want you to notice what the Bible says,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
what the psalmist declares in Psalm 119 in verse 97.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
He says, O how love I thy law!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It is my meditation all the day.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But notice in verse 159.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Notice what the psalmist says.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Notice the first phrase.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
You'll understand as you study through the 119th Psalm

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that there are many words that the psalmist uses

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to define the same book, the Bible, the word of God,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the portion of Scripture that they had.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Of course, they did not have the complete canon of Scripture.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
He refers to it as thy word, thy precepts, thy testimonies,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
thy statutes, and so on and so forth.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And you find here that the psalmist says,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, he's declared his love in verse 97.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In fact, we looked at a number of verses last week

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in which he declares his love for the law of the Lord.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But now in verse 159, the psalmist says,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That word consider is interesting,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and that word consider means this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It means to see, to look at, to inspect, to perceive.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I want you to think about Psalm 119 and verse 159

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
when the psalmist says, Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
He's really saying this, inspect, look at, examine,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
see my life, and consider my behavior

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and how my behavior supports my claim.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Consider how I love thy precepts.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I will note as we study Psalm 119 this morning,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
10 evidences from this portion of Scripture

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that I believe provide us with the evidence necessary

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to support the claim of the psalmist.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And then I will challenge each of us this morning

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to examine our own lives.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
As we'd come in here and say,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I love the Bible, I love God's word.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I hope you would say that this morning.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I hope every single person would say,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I love God's word, I love the Lord, and I love his word.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But is there evidence in my life,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is there evidence in your life that would support that claim?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Notice with me, number one, if you're taking notes,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
again, there's 10 of them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I was thinking about this this morning.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
If I was praying this morning, I said,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Man, if I just spend a couple of minutes on each appointment,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we're past our time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And so I'm gonna try to get through it quickly this morning.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I do hope that it'll be a blessing to you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And notice with me, number one, this morning,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the psalmist has a desire to learn the word.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Listen, if you love God's word,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you ought to have a desire to learn God's word.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And we find here that the psalmist,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
look in verse number seven,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and again, we'll just kind of march through Psalm 119,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and we'll look at a number of verses of Scripture.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But notice what the Bible says.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Verse 12 says, Blessed art thou, O Lord.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Notice where he says a very simple prayer.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Teach me thy statutes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Why does the psalmist over and over throughout the Psalm,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in fact, if you look at verse 26, he says,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I have declared my ways and thou heardest me.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Teach me thy statutes.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And you'll find repeated on a number of occasions

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in Psalm 119 where the psalmist says,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
teach me thy statutes, teach me thy law, teach me thy word.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Why does the psalmist desire to learn?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Well, because he loves the word of God.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
He loves the Bible.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And if we love the Bible,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we ought to have a desire to learn what it says.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Amen.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And we desire to learn.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And we find that the psalmist has expressed to us

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in this Psalm, this desire to learn.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And we find that in the New Testament,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the Bible says that we desire the sincere milk of the word,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that we may grow thereby.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It says this in 1 Peter 2, in verse number two,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that ye may grow thereby.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And the reality this morning is that we don't just desire

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that milk of the word as newborn babes,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but as we develop that appetite for God's word,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
we come to the place where we say, I desire to learn.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I want to learn God's word.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
You know, every day of your life, every day of my life,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
God will teach us his statutes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He will teach us his word.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And we need to have that teachable spirit.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
In fact, I believe this morning that if we love God's word,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that we will have a desire to learn the word of God.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Notice with me, number two, not only a desire to learn,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
but number two, a commitment to obey.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
A commitment to obey the word of God.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Listen, it's important to learn,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but learning without obedience is really not of any use.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We find that the Bible teaches us that we are to be doers

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of the word and not hearers only.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
The idea of learning the Bible and learning the word of God

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
is not so that we can win some Bible trivia game.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's not so that we can just have a bunch of knowledge

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and be puffed up.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
No, the idea of learning the Bible,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
learning the word of God, is to obey it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And so we find that the psalmist has a desire

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to learn the word of God,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but he also has a commitment to obey the word of God.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Notice with me in verse number eight of Psalm 119,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the Bible says this,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I will keep thy statutes.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Oh, forsake me not utterly.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Notice in verse number 33 what the psalmist says,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I shall keep it unto the end.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We see in verse number 33,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
both of these first two points that we've looked at

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
this morning where he says teach me,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but then he says I shall keep it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And this commitment to obey the word of God.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
What I've mentioned about Samuel in the past

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
when he says speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The idea of that word here, it carries with it

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
if you were to study that word out,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
it means to hear with the intent of obeying.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It means to give heed with the purpose of obeying

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the message that we receive.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
See, as we come to a place of gathering,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
as we have the opportunity four times a week

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to gather together as the people of God

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and to learn the word of God

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and have a commitment to obey the word of God.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
By the way, we find that a church is responsible,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
a church is a body of believers called out assembly

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and we find that the pastor has been given

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the responsibility to preach the word.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If the word is not being taught, not a place I'd go.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Amen?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Honestly, the Bible is to be taught.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It doesn't matter what my opinions are,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
it doesn't matter all of those things,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
but we need to be lifting up and exalting

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the Lord Jesus Christ and teaching this book

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and we find that as we come,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
why do we pray before the services?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We're praying, God, would you teach me?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Would you work in my life?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I come with this attitude of expectancy,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
desiring to hear from God.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I often say this, that we need to be ready to receive,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but also ready to respond.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.559
Lord, how would you speak to me through your Word today?

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:09.960
Maybe God spoke to you through a song already this morning.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:17.000
And God just uses the songs that are based on scriptural truth, and He uses His Word

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.840
in our hearts and our lives, and we have that commitment to obey the Word of God.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.879
Number three this morning, the psalmist has a plan to memorize the Word of God.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.520
He has a plan to memorize the Word of God.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.520
Why would I memorize it?

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.479
Well, because I love it.

00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:40.599
And if I love the Bible, if I love God's Word, then I memorize God's Word, and memorizing

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:42.799
is evidence that I do love it.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.560
Notice what he says in verse number 11, a verse that's very familiar to many of us.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:55.639
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.319
He's purposed.

00:10:57.319 --> 00:11:02.040
He has a plan to memorize God's Word.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.440
I know that oftentimes when we think about memorization, we think about the children,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.440
we think about Sunday school, and we think about Awan and other children's ministries,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.199
and the importance of hiding God's Word in their hearts and lives.

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:20.279
But I want you to understand that as the psalmist gives us this truth here, we find that because

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:26.080
he loves the Bible, because he loves the Word of God, he says, I'm going to hide His Word

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.160
in my heart.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.120
Every child of God ought to be memorizing God's Word.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.680
You say, well, I just don't have that great of a memory.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680
Ask God to help you.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.839
I mean, listen, if you only memorize a verse a year, praise God for a verse that you memorized.

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.319
Amen?

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:46.879
I know sometimes we set goals, we say, man, I'm going to memorize a verse a week.

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:51.199
I'm going to memorize 52 verses this week, and we get into about week number eight or

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:55.319
ten of the year, and we can't remember any of the first seven, eight verses that we've

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:57.559
memorized, and we're just kind of a mess.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:01.839
Listen, make goals that are achievable.

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:07.120
God, by your grace and with your help, I'll memorize a verse a year, a verse a month,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.199
a verse a quarter, whatever it might be, but God, would you help me memorize your Word?

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:13.199
Why?

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.199
Because I love it.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:15.440
I want you to think about what he says.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.199
He says, I have, notice what he says, thy Word have I hid in mine heart, that I might

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.199
not sin against thee.

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:27.720
I think it's interesting he used that word that he's hid the Word.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.399
He knows where it is.

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:33.119
It's in his heart.

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:34.119
He's purposed.

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:38.320
He's got this plan to memorize the Word of God.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.880
Our children are memorizing verses.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.600
I know that in Holly's class on Wednesday evening, they're working on memorization.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.880
I know that the children's church that's even downstairs now, how often they come up and

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.399
they'll sing for us and they'll rehearse, recite verses of Scripture.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.240
Man, that's wonderful.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.919
But this morning, I wonder, am I memorizing God's Word?

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:03.320
Are you memorizing God's Word?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.720
If I love it, I want to memorize it.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720
Why?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.720
Because I want to be able to recall it.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.000
When I've memorized God's Word, then I can recall it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.759
Maybe in that moment of temptation as we find in the wilderness with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:21.080
when that temptation comes, he's able to say, it is written.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.080
That's a good read.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.639
Look, he says that I might not sin against thee.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.880
God provides that way of escape.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.380
Oh, a plan to memorize.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.240
He memorizes because he loves.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.119
Notice with me number four, a plan not only to memorize, but a plan to meditate on the

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:36.119
Word.

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.160
A plan to meditate on the Word of God.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:44.399
Notice in verse 15, I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways.

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:50.199
He says in verse 23, princes also did sit and speak against me, but thy servant did

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:53.139
meditate in thy statutes.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:55.279
Of course, we're familiar with verse 97.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:14:00.320
We've used that last week as our main verse of getting into this portion of scripture.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.080
Oh, how love I thy law.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.119
It is my meditation all the day.

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:11.380
And the psalmist says this in Psalm 119 verse 148, mine eyes prevent the night watches that

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.360
I might meditate in thy Word.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.579
This thing of meditation is important.

00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:21.540
We find often throughout the Psalms where you'll read this word selah, and you think

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.220
about that word selah, and oftentimes in our society today, many of us don't have time

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.859
for selah because we're in a hurry, and we're trying to get through things and trying to

00:14:30.859 --> 00:14:35.459
get on to the next thing, and we got more things to do today than we could ever actually

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:40.179
accomplish today, and we're so task-oriented, we have so many things going on.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:45.059
But the psalmist says, thy Word is my meditation.

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:47.640
He's got a plan to meditate on the Word of God.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.059
That's why I believe it's important that we begin our day with reading the Bible.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.059
And I understand that some people say, I'm just not a morning person, I don't get anything

00:14:56.059 --> 00:14:59.940
out of it if I read it in the morning, and so I read it in the evening, and I say, good,

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.859
it's good that you read God's Word.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:06.899
But we find this morning it's amazing to me that as we read the Word of God in the morning,

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:11.380
how it can be our meditation throughout the day, how we can take that time.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.260
See, God says, be still and know that I am God.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:20.019
We have a hard time being still, we have a hard time meditating on the Word of God.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:24.619
See, today we live in a time in which things are so fast-paced, but then we also have the

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:29.179
other aspect where people are teaching and promoting this idea that meditation is getting

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:33.820
into some quiet place somewhere where you remove every thought from your mind and you're

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.700
just kind of in this moment of, mm, just nothing.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.700
That's not real meditation.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:46.779
And the psalmist says, what I'm going to meditate on is Your Word, it is my meditation.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:51.380
You know, we're really good, you think about this idea of meditation and the word Selah,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:57.779
just chewing on it, having it go over and just permeate our mind and just saturate our

00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:58.779
minds.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:07.019
And it's a wonderful thing to be thinking upon the truth of God's Word.

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:11.380
You know, somebody can offend us, somebody can hurt us, somebody can do us wrong and

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.459
all of a sudden that thing, that action, that comment just kind of replays in our head over

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:22.100
and over and over and over and over and over and we just begin to think about what that

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.140
person did and how they said and I can't believe and so on and so forth.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:32.299
And it's just, oh, that's how we should have God's Word in our mind, just constantly replaying

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:38.220
in our heart and our mind, meditating on God's Word.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.700
Notice with me number five, I find this evidence to support the claim of the psalmist that

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.380
he says, oh, how love I thy law.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:56.179
I would say number five, the psalmist has the discipline to search the Word, to study.

00:16:56.179 --> 00:17:00.140
Notice with me in verse number 94, notice what the Bible says.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:08.859
He says, I am thine, save me for I have sought thy precepts.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:13.059
The word sought there means to seek, but it doesn't just mean to seek, it means to seek

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:14.059
with care.

00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:17.420
You ever look for something?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.260
I mean, you're seeking for something.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.619
You misplaced it.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.059
Has that ever happened to anyone?

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:25.260
Come on.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.380
And you're seeking for it, right?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.220
And you're seeking with care, right?

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.100
You're diligent and you want to find that thing.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:40.540
Well, here the Bible says that the psalmist says, I have sought thy precepts.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.019
The idea of searching the scriptures, the idea of studying the scriptures, the Bible

00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:49.380
says, study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.179
rightly dividing the word of truth.

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:57.260
The Bible says, as Jesus is dealing with some people during his earthly ministry, he said,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.500
search the scriptures, for in them you think that you have eternal life, but they are they

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.459
which testify of me, in John chapter number five.

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:10.019
And the reality is that God's Word does testify of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.859
Jesus started with those disciples on the road to Emmaus and Luke.

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:14.859
He started where?

00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:19.140
With Moses and the prophets, and he expounded all things from the scriptures concerning

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.019
himself.

00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:27.820
We find this morning that the psalmist, he says, I have sought thy precepts.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.179
What makes the psalmist, what is it that motivates the psalmist?

00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:36.820
What is the driving factor in the life of the psalmist that makes him search to seek

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.099
with care God's Word?

00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:41.260
Well, he loves it.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.619
He loves it.

00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:46.460
And it's God's Word that reveals who God is.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.859
You say, I'm so thankful that God is gracious.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:50.500
How do you know that God is gracious?

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.539
Well, because he told us that he's gracious.

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:59.700
But I wonder this morning, if each of us had the responsibility, we were given a sheet

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.979
of paper, say, with a list of maybe 25 different attributes of God, I mean, attributes that

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:11.020
I think each and every one of us would agree to, attributes that each of us would be familiar

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.979
with, and we'd say, is God gracious?

00:19:13.979 --> 00:19:15.380
Yes or no?

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.380
Yes.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.559
Give me a verse that proves it.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:22.419
How many of us could put a verse down?

00:19:22.419 --> 00:19:24.059
Is God merciful?

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.059
Yes or no?

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:26.059
Yes.

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:29.500
Give me a verse.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.020
Did God ever sin?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.020
Yes or no?

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:36.059
No.

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:37.419
Give me a verse.

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:41.820
I'm not saying give me a verse like I'm the teacher, but I'm saying that's how we're supposed

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.859
to search the Scriptures, that we know it, not just that we know about the attributes

00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:53.219
of God, but we know them, that we can get into this book and that we can say, I know

00:19:53.219 --> 00:19:58.500
that God is great, and I know that God is gracious, and I know that God is merciful,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.979
and I know that God is perfect.

00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:04.539
I know that God, fill in the blank, because I have verses of Scripture, because I have

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.539
sought.

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:13.419
I've sought it, I've searched it, I've studied it, because I love the Bible.

00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:18.419
So I would say this, as I mentioned the point, the discipline to search the Word, it requires

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:19.419
discipline.

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:22.299
It requires discipline.

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:27.739
It's easy to just hear somebody else tell us something, but the discipline for us ourselves

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:34.259
to go and to search and to study the Word of God.

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:39.139
I would say this, number six, the Bible tells us that the psalmist makes this declaration

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:43.579
that the Word of God was his delight.

00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:45.059
Why was it his delight?

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:47.299
Well, because he loved it.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:53.739
And the evidence of his love for God's Word was that it was his delight.

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:59.179
You know, it's kind of interesting if somebody says, I love, fill in the blank, maybe somebody

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:02.259
says they love their spouse, but they never spend time with their spouse.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:04.579
You say, what's going on with that?

00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:07.219
That's kind of weird, right?

00:21:07.219 --> 00:21:10.859
If you love your spouse, you're going to spend time with your spouse.

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:14.059
I love the church, and you never can find them.

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:15.779
You say, how much do you really love the church?

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:16.779
You don't come.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:18.779
You understand what I'm saying?

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:20.979
I love pizza, but I haven't eaten it in three years.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:23.619
Well, how much do you really, I mean, you understand.

00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:28.499
But the psalmist says, I love God's Word, and therefore God's Word is my delight.

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:32.299
The word delight means to affect with great pleasure, to bring joy.

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:36.939
Listen, I hope this morning that God's Word brings joy in your life.

00:21:36.939 --> 00:21:41.619
When you read it this morning, even as I mentioned last week, that God's Word all at the same

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:44.099
time will convict us and comfort us.

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:49.059
It's amazing, this book that we hold in our hands, that we're privileged to have.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:53.819
Notice in verse number 16, notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 119 and verse 16.

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:59.299
The Bible says this, I will delight myself in thy statutes.

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:01.819
Then he says this, I will not forget thy word.

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:03.139
That's an interesting statement, is it not?

00:22:03.139 --> 00:22:08.019
In fact, there are many times within the psalm, this psalm, that he says something about not

00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:12.579
forgetting thy word, thy statutes, and that's an interesting statement.

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:17.379
But I believe that as he would meditate upon the truth that God had given him, it will

00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:21.059
help him not to forget it.

00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:25.179
But I want you to see that he says, I will delight myself in thy statutes.

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:33.739
He says again in verse number 24, thy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.

00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:36.699
What is it that brings you joy?

00:22:36.699 --> 00:22:39.059
What is it that brings you satisfaction?

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:42.179
What is it that brings you pleasure?

00:22:42.499 --> 00:22:49.759
There are some today that based upon a particular team that they follow, having success brings

00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:55.139
them a measure of joy, brings them a measure of delight.

00:22:55.139 --> 00:23:01.379
I remember speaking to a man years ago, and he was dealing with a problem with alcohol,

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:05.459
and I remember having this conversation with this individual and asking him, what is it

00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:07.459
that caused him to drink?

00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:08.859
And here's what he said to me.

00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:14.859
He said the team that he followed lost, and I thought, what in the world?

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:19.019
I mean, it just, that's how it hit me.

00:23:19.019 --> 00:23:24.979
But the team that he followed lost, and he turned to the bottle because he was looking

00:23:24.979 --> 00:23:31.819
for some joy, some pleasure, some satisfaction in a victory, by the way, that doesn't even

00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:36.499
matter in light of eternity.

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:43.539
This morning, the psalmist says, thy word, thy testimonies are my delight.

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:45.779
Not only are they my delight, they're my counselors.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:50.899
And I wonder this morning, would we say that God's word brings joy in our lives?

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:58.499
He says in verse 47, notice, and I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved,

00:23:58.499 --> 00:24:01.179
which I have loved.

00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:05.379
Look over at verse 174, there's a number of other ones, but we'll just kind of skip around

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:06.379
here.

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:13.419
And he says, nearing the end of this psalm, he says in verse number 174, I have longed

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:20.979
for thy salvation, O Lord, and thy law is my delight.

00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:21.979
It is my delight.

00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:25.579
What did the psalmist say in Psalm chapter number 1?

00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:26.859
We are familiar with this psalm.

00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:31.539
The Bible says, blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:38.659
in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in

00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:46.339
the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:52.099
And God's word is his delight because he loves it, and when he makes the statement that it's

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:59.659
his delight, when we read and we look at his behavior, we find that it being the Bible,

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:05.299
the Scriptures, the commandments, the testimony being his delight gives evidence that he loves

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:07.339
God's word.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:12.579
Number seven, he longed for God's word.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:14.719
He longed for God's word.

00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:24.219
Notice in verse number 125 of this psalm, back in Psalm 119, and notice verse 125, notice

00:25:24.219 --> 00:25:32.499
what he says, I am thy servant, give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.

00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:39.019
I want you to think about this idea of longing for the testimonies, and he says that I may

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:40.519
know.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:47.019
He says give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies, and we think about this longing

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:48.019
for God's word.

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:52.979
Have you ever been in a time, in a place where maybe you had an emergency come up, there's

00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:57.539
something that took place and your day was interrupted and you were not able to start

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:02.619
and follow your, maybe your routine of getting into the Bible first thing in the morning

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:07.219
because of some emergency that came up, and man, it's happened to me.

00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:11.939
I've gotten phone calls before from some members that have dealt with some difficulties, some

00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:15.659
health things or whatever it's been, and I need to go to the hospital first thing in

00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:20.379
the morning, and it's just kind of affected my schedule.

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:21.379
It happens.

00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:30.579
I'll find myself in the afternoon, I can't wait to get to my time with God.

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:34.019
I long to read the Bible.

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:36.779
I'm longing for God's word.

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:40.699
See, have you ever skipped a meal?

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:44.339
I mean physically, you've skipped a meal.

00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:48.179
We're down there in South Carolina, and I think it was on Tuesday or Wednesday, we didn't

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:49.179
have any lunch.

00:26:49.179 --> 00:26:55.139
I think it was Tuesday, and Holly looked at me and she said, I'm hungry.

00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:57.619
She said, I just need some meat.

00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:58.619
That's what mommy said.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:59.859
No, she never says she needs meat.

00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:03.019
In fact, there's been times we've gone out to dinner and she orders a veggie plate.

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:04.579
I said, what is a veggie plate?

00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:06.299
You get to pick five veggies.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:07.299
No thank you.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:10.739
I pick five meats, I'm for it, amen?

00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:12.939
But she picked five veggies, you know?

00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:13.939
And she said, I'm hungry.

00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:14.939
Why?

00:27:14.939 --> 00:27:15.939
Because we skipped a meal.

00:27:15.939 --> 00:27:17.539
She's ready for dinner.

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:20.979
Listen, if you skip a meal, you get a reminder.

00:27:20.979 --> 00:27:22.619
Your body reminds you.

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:25.859
You skip several meals, your body reminds you.

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:32.779
I wonder this morning how it is if our time with God is delayed for some reason.

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:39.159
Our ability to read and to get into the Bible is interrupted because of something that happens

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:40.159
in life.

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.699
And I understand there are interruptions, there are times in which we cannot control

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:44.699
those circumstances.

00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:46.699
Now, there are times in which we can.

00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:49.299
There are times in which we can say, no, I'm not going to deal with that right now because

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:51.059
I am spending time with God.

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:53.339
But there are times that we just can't do that.

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:54.459
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:27:54.459 --> 00:27:55.459
It happens in life.

00:27:55.459 --> 00:28:00.059
But if that happens, I wonder, do we long for it?

00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:04.539
Are we anxious to get to our time with God and His Word?

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.299
Do we long for God?

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:07.619
Do we long for His Word?

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:11.299
I would say this, He valued God's Word, number eight.

00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:13.099
He valued God's Word.

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:19.059
The Bible tells us in verse number 128, He says this, He says, Therefore, I esteem all

00:28:19.059 --> 00:28:24.459
thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way.

00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:25.979
Verse 127, excuse me.

00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:34.380
He says, Therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:40.139
I used this verse of Scripture last week and I mentioned that many people today love gold.

00:28:40.139 --> 00:28:41.299
They do.

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:42.739
They love gold.

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:45.539
Gold represents wealth.

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:50.500
We find that many people love, and many people will go through great lengths in order to

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.739
obtain wealth, in order to obtain some status, and we find here that the psalmist says, no,

00:28:56.739 --> 00:29:03.500
I want you to understand that I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold, and because

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:11.820
I love thy commandments above gold, above fine gold, therefore, I esteem all thy precepts

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.459
concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false way.

00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:23.059
And so we see these two verses together, and we see verse 128 where He says about esteeming

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:24.059
the Word of God.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:27.019
I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things.

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:33.979
And we know that Job, he mentioned about esteeming the Word of God, and as we think about that

00:29:33.979 --> 00:29:39.579
Word of esteem, and we dealt with this last week, and we focused upon the truth of that,

00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:44.820
and thinking about the place that we, the emphasis and the place that we have on God's

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.979
Word.

00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:46.979
We esteem it.

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:49.500
We value it.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.659
We find here that the psalmist says because of his love for God's Word, he's going to

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:56.739
esteem, but notice what he says.

00:29:56.739 --> 00:29:59.339
I love how he words this in verse number 128.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:00.099
He says, I esteem.

00:30:00.099 --> 00:30:05.099
all thy precepts concerning all things.

00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:09.699
Now that's pretty conclusive, all-inclusive, excuse me.

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:11.819
I mean, he's including it all, right?

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:15.939
He's saying I love all thy precepts.

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:19.499
Not just certain ones, I'm not just picking certain ones.

00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:20.799
You ever go to a buffet?

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:24.319
You go to a buffet and what do you do?

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:25.379
Well, there's certain things you like

00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:27.019
and there's certain things you don't like.

00:30:27.019 --> 00:30:29.219
And you go heavy on the things that you like

00:30:29.219 --> 00:30:31.259
and you skip over the things that you don't like.

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:33.719
Right, isn't that how it works at a buffet?

00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:37.039
You pick and choose, correct?

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.939
That's not how we approach God's Word.

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:41.259
We don't approach God's Word

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:42.979
the way that we approach a buffet.

00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:44.499
We don't approach God's Word with saying,

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:48.459
well, I really like this, but nah, that's not really for me.

00:30:48.459 --> 00:30:51.579
I've heard people say today, many times over the years,

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:53.019
I've heard people make the statement,

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.419
well, you know, the Old Testament

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.619
really isn't for us anymore.

00:30:56.619 --> 00:30:57.979
You know how much you miss?

00:30:58.979 --> 00:31:01.099
You know how much you miss?

00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:03.379
By the way, the New Testament says of the Old Testament

00:31:03.379 --> 00:31:05.339
that it was written for our admonition.

00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:08.899
That's what he says.

00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:12.059
Not only for our admonition, but also for our learning.

00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:13.779
Wow.

00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:18.179
Groups of people that just remove it.

00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:22.859
There's a popular preacher, Andy Stanley.

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:27.399
Popular man, wrong man.

00:31:28.659 --> 00:31:29.819
You know what he said about the Old Testament?

00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:33.579
We need to unhitch from the Old Testament.

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:35.779
That's what he said about the Old Testament.

00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:39.139
And now you begin to look at some of their teaching,

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:40.459
there's no wonder that they unhitch

00:31:40.459 --> 00:31:43.919
not only from the Old Testament, but from all of God's Word.

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.999
Seriously, it's a disaster.

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:50.299
This morning, the psalmist says,

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:52.419
I esteem all thy precepts.

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:57.419
Notice what he says, concerning all things.

00:31:57.859 --> 00:31:58.899
Wow.

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:04.939
God addresses the issues of life in His Word.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:08.339
He does.

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:13.339
God uses His Word to address the issues of life.

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:17.899
And the psalmist says, I esteem all thy precepts

00:32:17.899 --> 00:32:22.899
concerning all things, notice what he says, to be right.

00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:27.139
Now that's important that we understand that.

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:29.059
Why, because your opinion's not right,

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.019
my opinion's not right, our culture's not right.

00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:34.379
Now if it's right, it's only because

00:32:34.379 --> 00:32:35.879
it aligns with God's Word.

00:32:36.939 --> 00:32:40.619
Because God's Word is what is right.

00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:43.599
And the psalmist says that he esteems all thy precepts

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:47.219
concerning all things to be right.

00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:49.219
You think about some of the all things.

00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:51.339
I mean, again, that's encompassing.

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:53.499
Everything that we would face in life,

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:55.379
the Bible says this, that we're to keep our hearts

00:32:55.379 --> 00:32:58.979
with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:00.499
In Proverbs chapter number four.

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:03.019
And you think about all things that we'd face.

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:05.339
Today there are questions about all sorts of things

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:08.099
that say, well, what does God's Word say?

00:33:08.099 --> 00:33:12.219
Because I esteem that all thy precepts

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:15.799
concerning all things to be right.

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:20.139
We're not gonna discard God's Word.

00:33:20.139 --> 00:33:23.439
We're not gonna say, well, you know, times have changed

00:33:23.439 --> 00:33:25.519
and things are different now

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:27.959
and we need to be more open-minded

00:33:27.959 --> 00:33:29.799
and we need to be more inclusive

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:31.799
and we need to be, no, no, no, no.

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:33.819
We need to be biblically correct.

00:33:35.479 --> 00:33:37.479
I know that's not popular today.

00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:38.919
I understand that.

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:40.739
I do not have my head in the sand.

00:33:42.859 --> 00:33:44.999
But we must be biblically accurate.

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:46.879
We must be biblically correct.

00:33:46.879 --> 00:33:50.519
You know, it'd be a sad thing to conform to this world

00:33:50.719 --> 00:33:55.719
and forsake God's Word and then stand before Him one day.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.279
I don't wanna do that.

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:02.439
I don't wanna do that.

00:34:02.439 --> 00:34:05.879
So the psalmist says that he values,

00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:09.879
he esteems all thy precepts

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:12.399
concerning all things to be right.

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:14.779
Notice the Bible tells us, number nine,

00:34:14.779 --> 00:34:19.319
if you're taking notes, that he stood in awe of God's Word.

00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:21.239
It means to revere it.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.239
In verse number 161,

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:29.359
it says, princes have persecuted me without a cause,

00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:35.279
but my heart standeth in awe of thy Word.

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:40.599
Well, this morning, how much do we revere God's Word?

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:44.519
Have we come to that place where we're standing in awe

00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:47.599
of what God has given us in His Word?

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:51.359
We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 138,

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:53.639
in verse number two, he says,

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.619
I will worship toward thy holy temple

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:57.839
and praise thy name for thy loving kindness

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:01.919
and for thy truth, for thou hast magnified thy Word

00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:03.879
above all thy name.

00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:06.139
Listen, we ought to stand in awe of who God is.

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:10.399
We find that the psalmist declares that in Psalm 34.

00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:12.999
The Bible teaches us, excuse me, Psalm 33,

00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:15.079
in verse number eight, let all the earth fear the Lord.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:18.479
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:19.419
We ought to stand in awe of God,

00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:23.619
but we ought to stand in awe of His Word to revere it.

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:29.239
We find number 10, that the psalmist,

00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:32.759
what evidence do we have to support the claim?

00:35:32.759 --> 00:35:34.599
Oh, how love I thy law.

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.439
Really?

00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:39.159
Really, you love the law of the Lord?

00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:40.559
You love God's Word?

00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:44.159
He says, yes, I love it, and consider how I love it.

00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:50.319
We find number 10, that he purposed to speak God's Word.

00:35:50.319 --> 00:35:52.719
He purposed to speak God's Word.

00:35:52.719 --> 00:35:57.159
Notice in verse 172 of Psalm 119,

00:35:58.219 --> 00:36:00.519
the Bible says this in verse 172,

00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:05.119
my tongue shall speak of thy Word

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:10.639
for all thy commandments are righteousness.

00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:14.559
My tongue shall speak of thy Word.

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:19.359
See, he loved God's Word, and he meditated upon God's Word,

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:21.599
and all of these other things that we've looked at,

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:23.319
and it leads to him saying,

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:27.599
I'm purposed to speak of God's Word.

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.999
Look over at Psalm 37.

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:30.319
We studied this for those that are

00:36:30.319 --> 00:36:33.099
in our Wednesday evening prayer and Bible study here

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:34.999
that are not in some other class.

00:36:34.999 --> 00:36:37.399
We studied this, but if you're in another class,

00:36:37.399 --> 00:36:38.799
I wanna draw your attention to this

00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:41.079
and remind those that were here for that message,

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:43.519
this truth in Psalm 37.

00:36:43.519 --> 00:36:45.879
Notice what the Bible says in verse 30

00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:47.719
and also in verse number 31.

00:36:48.759 --> 00:36:50.319
Again, the psalmist is saying

00:36:50.319 --> 00:36:54.159
that he's purposed to speak the Word.

00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:56.279
It says in verse number 30 of Psalm 37,

00:36:56.279 --> 00:37:00.079
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom,

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:03.079
and his tongue talketh of judgment.

00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:04.719
Why does he speak the way that he does?

00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:06.959
Well, the answer is found in verse 31,

00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:10.759
the law of his God is in his heart.

00:37:10.759 --> 00:37:12.759
The law of his God is in his heart.

00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:17.039
So no wonder his mouth is going to speak of wisdom

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:19.659
and his tongue is going to talk of judgment

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:23.519
because God's Word, his law is in his heart.

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:27.279
And it's in his heart because he loves it.

00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:29.199
Remember the point that we looked at

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:31.559
that he had a plan to memorize God's Word.

00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:33.999
He said, oh, how love I thy law,

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:37.039
but we find that as we study through Psalm 119,

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:41.839
we see all of these evidences that are provided to us,

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:44.119
scattered through this psalm,

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:47.199
that help us to see how the psalmist,

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:51.319
there's overwhelming evidence to support the claim

00:37:52.639 --> 00:37:55.359
that he loves God's Word.

00:37:56.279 --> 00:37:59.279
And this morning, I wonder in my life,

00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:01.079
I wonder in your life,

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:04.119
I wonder if we were to take the time this morning

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:06.839
to just evaluate our own lives

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:11.079
and looking over just the last week or the last month

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:13.719
or maybe just this calendar year,

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:18.039
these two and a half months that we've had in 2023

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:20.839
and say, is there evidence in my life

00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:26.919
that would support the claim that I love God's Word,

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:29.799
that I love God's Word?

00:38:30.799 --> 00:38:33.339
See, the evidence is overwhelming

00:38:33.339 --> 00:38:35.979
in support for what the psalmist declared,

00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:40.619
the expression of his love,

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:43.059
but the evidence of his love.

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:46.139
I'm gonna read to you an account of an individual,

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:48.139
his name is William McPherson,

00:38:48.139 --> 00:38:50.359
and some of you may have heard of this individual

00:38:50.359 --> 00:38:51.699
at some point,

00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:55.500
but this man was a superintendent of a stone quarry,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.819
and as he was working there

00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:59.779
and he was successful in his work and what have you,

00:38:59.779 --> 00:39:01.859
he's working, obviously working in a stone quarry,

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:03.819
there's some danger that's there,

00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:07.419
and he had, unfortunately, there was a blast

00:39:07.419 --> 00:39:09.099
that took place at this stone quarry,

00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:10.299
and he was in the wrong place,

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.339
and he was severely injured.

00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:15.779
Through this blast and through this injury,

00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:18.699
this man lost his eyesight

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:21.159
and both of his hands in the explosion.

00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:26.779
I want you to think about being in that position.

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:32.579
No eyesight, no hands.

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:36.599
I'm thankful that for folks that are blind,

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:37.579
there's Braille.

00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:41.459
In fact, you can get Braille Bibles.

00:39:41.459 --> 00:39:43.579
They have those.

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:46.699
And someone that's blind can still have the opportunity

00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:51.139
to, with a Braille Bible, read the Bible.

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:55.259
In fact, some of you might know the name of Don Forrester.

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:57.139
He was a pastor down in Fredericksburg

00:39:57.139 --> 00:39:59.339
at Faith Baptist Church for a number of years.

00:39:59.339 --> 00:40:00.179
And I remember the first time

00:40:00.179 --> 00:40:05.419
ever heard him preach was on a CD and I had no idea that he was blind. I'd never met the

00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:10.739
man before and somebody as soon as I got to Virginia gave me a CD of his because I was

00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:15.279
taking a trip to the Grand Canyon and said, hey, Brother Forster preached about his trip

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:18.139
to the Grand Canyon, why don't you listen to this on the way? And I did and I had no

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:22.059
idea that he was blind. And I'm hearing him talk about all these things and then I find

00:40:22.059 --> 00:40:26.619
out that he's blind and it was very interesting as somebody would have to detail things to

00:40:26.619 --> 00:40:32.759
him and explain things and so on and so forth. But then I heard him preach in person. Phenomenal.

00:40:32.759 --> 00:40:37.539
Has anyone ever, you've ever been in a setting where Don Forster preached? My dad, anyone

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:42.859
else? He stands up there, he's completely blind and he has, and he just, he uses his

00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:55.019
hand right here and I mean, it's phenomenal. But this man lost both of his hands. No eyesight,

00:40:55.019 --> 00:41:04.359
no hands. But this man, William McPherson, was determined to read the Bible. He was determined

00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:13.059
to read the Bible. So here's what he did. He learned how to read raised letters with

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:24.779
the tip of his tongue. He learned how to read raised letters with the tip of his tongue.

00:41:24.779 --> 00:41:35.619
It is said that William McPherson read through the Bible four times with the tip of his tongue.

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:42.539
That's phenomenal. That's phenomenal. But that's the testimony of somebody that said,

00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:49.779
I love God's Word. And though I've lost my eyesight and though I've lost my hands, I

00:41:49.779 --> 00:42:01.779
want to read God's Word. Unfortunately, surveys have been taken for years now. Surveys, I'm

00:42:01.779 --> 00:42:09.059
not sure who they survey, but surveys have been taken for years of people that claim

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:14.339
to be Christians. And again, I say claim to be because I don't know who they're surveying.

00:42:14.339 --> 00:42:18.939
They ask the question how often they read their Bibles. They ask the question of how

00:42:18.939 --> 00:42:24.500
many have read their Bible through once, not just in a year, but in their lifetime. And

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:33.459
consistently those statistics are sad as to how few ever read the Bible from Genesis

00:42:33.459 --> 00:42:39.139
to Revelation. I'm not talking about, and again, I don't know the people, so I don't

00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:44.939
know if they're saved. They claim to be Christians. But here's a man that's lost his eyesight

00:42:44.939 --> 00:42:53.899
in both of his hands and it's said that four times with the tip of his tongue he read the

00:42:53.899 --> 00:43:02.459
Bible from cover to cover. And we can look at that and we say, that's amazing. That's

00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:10.859
just the evidence of an individual that loves God's Word. What would cause him to have that

00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:16.899
kind of love for God's Word? Well, he understood what it was. He understood that God's Word

00:43:16.899 --> 00:43:22.619
was God's Word. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. He understood that it

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:27.659
had been preserved. He understood that it was profitable. He understood all that we've

00:43:27.659 --> 00:43:35.419
looked at these past few weeks and he said, I need to read the Bible. And I'm not sure

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:40.919
how I'm going to be able to read it, but I need to read it. And he learned to read letters

00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:48.099
with the tip of his tongue. Unbelievable. Amazing. But the evidence of a man that loved

00:43:48.099 --> 00:43:56.459
God's Word. This morning we've looked at ten things from Psalm 119 that I believe, and

00:43:56.459 --> 00:44:03.259
I think you could find more, but I believe they reveal to us, they provide for us evidence

00:44:03.259 --> 00:44:11.439
that supports the claim when the psalmist says, oh how love I thy law. It is my meditation

00:44:11.439 --> 00:44:22.059
all the day. Because we can make any claim we want, but is there evidence to support

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:28.539
the claim? I believe this morning that the answer to that question for the psalmist would

00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:36.940
be yes. Absolutely there is evidence that supports the claim that the psalmist expressed

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:42.220
when he said, I love God's Word. But what about our lives? What about my life? What

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:48.979
about your life? Is the evidence there? Does the evidence support the claim? I love God's

00:44:48.979 --> 00:44:55.419
Word. I love God's Word. Those ten things, I'm not going to repeat them, but I do want

00:44:55.419 --> 00:45:01.179
you to evaluate your own life. Ask the Lord to help us this morning. Do I really love

00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:08.220
God's Word? Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.779
the testimony of the psalmist and as we've noted last week how he expressed his love

00:45:13.779 --> 00:45:21.019
for thy Word. We looked at a number of reasons that led to his declaration as to why he would

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:27.019
say, oh how love I thy law. But now this morning as we look at the evidence that supports the

00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:35.820
claim. God I pray that you would help each of us this morning to evaluate our own lives.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:43.380
That we would examine our own lives and we would be honest in our evaluation. That we

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:52.859
would be humble in our evaluation. I say that I love God's Word. But is the evidence

00:45:52.859 --> 00:46:02.059
there to support the claim? We thank you for the testimony of Mr. McPherson. No doubt he

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:09.739
loved thy Word. And God I pray that through your Word this morning you would cause us

00:46:09.779 --> 00:46:16.739
to have a greater appreciation for your Word, a greater love for your Word. That the evidence

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:26.220
would be just so obvious in our lives that even others that would look at us and say

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:33.220
man they must really love the Bible. They love God's Word. They're always talking about

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:41.779
it. Lord I pray that you would help us this morning. Work in hearts and lives as only

00:46:41.779 --> 00:46:46.339
you can. We'll thank you for the work that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray.
