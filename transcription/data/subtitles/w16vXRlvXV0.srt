1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
For Proverbs chapter number four and as you're turning there

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:10,340
We're looking at verses 1 through 13 from this passage of Scripture many countries around the world observe Father's Day

3
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:17,520
The specific date varies. In fact, a lot of countries will celebrate Father's Day today the third Sunday in June

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,520
Of course, that's when we as the United States of America, that's when we observe Father's Day

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,280
But we find that in many regions of the world

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,560
there are many countries that observe a day on their calendar each and every year to recognize Father's Day and

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,560
That date may vary but here of course as I mentioned a moment ago today is Father's Day

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,680
In the United States the first observance that we can tell from what we look at in history was in June of 1910 out in

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,560
Washington State in fact and

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,799
It kind of went on for a little while and some of the clergy members to use that term

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,759
As it was used in the particular article they made decisions that they would preach a message on fathers and they would

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,400
Address it in in like fashion is what they had done with Mother's Day and what have you?

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,519
but it would did not become a permanent national holiday until 1972 and

14
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,800
That really isn't that long ago, of course for a number of years

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,919
It was observed before, you know from 1910 until 1972, but it was not an official

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,440
Holiday in the United States of America until made a permanent national holiday until 1972

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:32,720
the purpose as it stated is this to honor fatherhood and paternal bonds as well as the influence of fathers in

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,599
society

19
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,919
The reality is that as we go to the Word of God

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,839
We find that back in the book of Deuteronomy in the sixth chapter that Moses gave very specific

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,800
Instruction to the role of fathers on influencing their families for the Lord and that responsibility was given

22
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:54,040
of course the children of Israel if you think about the book of Deuteronomy and obviously if you've been with us through the

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,400
Study of the book of Joshua

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,360
You understand that Moses is preparing that generation for entrance into the land and all of the things that they would become

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,120
You know be able to see and all that they would conquer and the things that they would now be

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,220
Exposed to and so on and so forth and we find that God used Moses to give some very important

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,220
Instruction to that generation and as you read the sixth chapter in particular

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,100
There is very direct instruction that is given to fathers

29
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,020
It is interesting if you were to study that passage of Scripture that there is an emphasis

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,500
placed upon the fathers knowing the truth and living the truth and

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,460
Then teaching the truth and by the way when we go in that order, we're much more effective

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,380
when our message of our life

33
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:45,940
Matches the message of our lips and that's why I think there's such an important emphasis that is placed in Deuteronomy chapter number six of

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Those fathers knowing the truth

35
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:52,539
Living the truth and then teaching the truth as we look at the book of Proverbs

36
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,979
We have the opportunity from a human perspective. Obviously, it's the Word of God. It's divinely inspired

37
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:03,419
But humanly speaking we have the opportunity the privilege of you will to read of the instruction of a father

38
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,500
In fact, that's the title for the message this morning the instruction of a father

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,979
you'll see that in verse number one of chapter number four and it's interesting if we look at the

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,740
Specifics as to what's taking place in the book of Proverbs. You see that Solomon is speaking to his children in particular

41
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:25,380
Rehoboam and we find that instruction is being given it's being passed on

42
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,979
In fact in our text of Scripture this morning in chapter number four

43
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:35,500
You'll find that Solomon references how that his father David taught him you can look at the passages of Scripture

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,460
At the end of the life of King David and you can see first Kings chapter number two in particular

45
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,779
you can see where he calls for

46
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,860
Solomon and he gives them instruction and we find that

47
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:53,960
Solomon here in the book of Proverbs is providing this instruction for his children in particular for Rehoboam

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But really there's a much greater

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:04,160
truth that is found within the book of Proverbs more than Solomon sitting down and speaking to his children or to his child we

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,839
find that God our Father is

51
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Speaking truth to us as his children, you know, it's an absolute blessing to say I'm a child of God and

52
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,559
By the way, there are many people that make the claim that they're a child of God

53
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,000
And so let me help you understand that you can only be a child of God if you've been saved by the blood of the crucified

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,920
One there's some people that would like to purport this idea that we're all the children of God

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,760
We understand that God is the Creator

56
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,640
But you understand that you enter into that relationship of him being our father and we being his children

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,279
Only through redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ

58
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,440
But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God

59
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:53,519
Amen, and what a blessing I'm so thankful for the truth of God's Word with regard to that

60
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,959
And so this morning as we study this passage of scripture in Proverbs chapter 4 and we know the instruction of a father

61
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:04,959
Will deal specifically with how Solomon is seeking to influence his children

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,040
But more broadly speaking we must not miss the the truth of the application that God our Father

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,320
Has given us instruction and we must take heed to it our lives

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,920
Should be characterized by obedience to the instruction of our father

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,920
Amen, our life should be characterized by

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,519
obedience to the instruction of our heavenly father

67
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,279
We see that truth that is revealed to us in the book of Proverbs with regard to the human relationship

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,679
Between Solomon and his son and about the importance of taking heed and obeying and following and keeping and so on and so forth

69
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:52,839
but on a much higher plane a much more important perspective is that we would

70
00:05:53,119 --> 00:06:01,079
understand that our heavenly father has given us instruction in this book that we call the Bible and all that our lives would be

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,880
characterized by obeying the word

72
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:11,880
Therefore this morning as we look at the passage of scripture. Yes, there is a charge to the fathers humanly speaking our

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,799
Responsibility there's a charge to the children their responsibility to receive the instruction that's been given to them

74
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,799
But really as we look at the the the application for each and every one of us say I'm not a father

75
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm not a child living at home anymore. That's okay

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,399
Because if you're a child of God

77
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:36,640
There is rich truth in this passage of scripture for each and every one of us and I hope that we would make the decision

78
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,519
To say yes Lord. Yes, which one obey

79
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:47,000
I mentioned a passage of scripture not long ago. I don't remember exactly which message it was that I was preaching

80
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,959
It may have been a Joshua lesson for all I know. I'm not sure exactly

81
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,279
I didn't go back and look it up as to when I made the statement, but it was in John chapter number two at the

82
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,679
Miracle there at Cana and Mary comes to those

83
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:08,720
Servants and they say she says to them speaking of Jesus whatsoever. He saith unto you

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Do it I love the simplicity of that statement

85
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,260
Isn't it? Isn't it? It's simple right whatsoever. He saith unto you

86
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:25,679
Do it and oh that we would have that perspective notice in our passage of scripture

87
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,640
The Bible says this I'll read the entirety and then we'll break it down this morning verse number one here

88
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,359
Ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding

89
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,359
For I give you good doctrine

90
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,920
Forsaking not my law for I was my father's son tender and only beloved of the in the sight of my mother

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,959
He taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live

92
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,519
Get wisdom get understanding

93
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,140
Forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee

94
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,339
Love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principle thing

95
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,160
Therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding

96
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,859
Exalt her wisdom and she shall promote thee

97
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,380
She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her

98
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:24,100
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee

99
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,459
Here, oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many

100
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:33,299
I've taught thee in the way of wisdom

101
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:40,020
I have led thee in right paths when thou goest thy steps shall not be straightened and when thou runnest

102
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,419
Thou shalt not stumble take fast hold of instruction

103
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,419
Let her not go keep her for she is

104
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,599
Thy life now when we read this passage of scripture

105
00:08:54,479 --> 00:09:00,559
Strictly from the perspective of Solomon speaking to Rehoboam we say well, this is good instruction

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,039
Solomon didn't always follow the instruction he gave

107
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,880
Amen, in fact in my own personal Bible reading this morning the the place in which I started this morning

108
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,320
Just where I was was in first Kings dealing with how he Solomon loved many strange women and all that situation with the

109
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,000
Idolatry and what-have-you and so we find that if we read the passage of scripture strictly from that perspective

110
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,960
We'll glean some things but we won't glean the fullness of what we're looking at

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,080
if we take that perspective that God our Heavenly Father is

112
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:44,559
Giving us instruction and we understand we break down the passage of scripture. Oh how rich it becomes as

113
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,320
We look at the passage we see first of all the responsibility of the father

114
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:55,840
we understand that as I mentioned back in Deuteronomy chapter number 6 and we could look at the examples of

115
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:59,840
of those that were even recorded for us in the book of Genesis and

116
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,520
the instruction of Adam, no doubt, to his family, and you can deal with Noah, and

117
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,960
you can deal with Abraham, and so on and so forth, then

118
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,000
you can understand that there was a responsibility and there was a

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
fulfillment of responsibility in many of those cases

120
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,400
to give instruction, to teach

121
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,320
the children. As we think about the responsibility of the Father, I notice the

122
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
message of His lips.

123
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,280
When I speak about His, specifically, contextually, dealing with Solomon,

124
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,560
and we'll make the application, but notice what he says.

125
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
Solomon says, hear ye children, notice the instruction of a father.

126
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,280
Well, if they're gonna hear it, he's speaking it. Is that too far of a stretch?

127
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Amen? And so, the message of his lips,

128
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,880
the instruction that he's giving through his speech, he says,

129
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,320
hear ye children, the instruction of the Father, and attend to no

130
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
understanding.

131
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,040
Notice what he says, for I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

132
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Notice that as we consider,

133
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,880
he says again, in verse number 10, hear,

134
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,920
O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life

135
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,280
shall be many. And so, we see this idea of the message of His lips. In fact, if we

136
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,880
were to take a quick survey

137
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,480
through several chapters of the book of Proverbs, notice with me, in Proverbs

138
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
chapter number one,

139
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,440
in verse number eight, notice what the Bible says here in the first chapter of the book of

140
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,200
Proverbs.

141
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,960
It says, my son, notice again, hear

142
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,880
the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law

143
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,920
of thy mother. In chapter two, in verse number one,

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,080
my son, if thou wilt receive

145
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,160
my words, and hide my commandments with thee.

146
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,120
We notice in chapter three, in verse number one, my son, forget not my law,

147
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,920
but let thine heart keep my commandments. We've read the passage in chapter number four.

148
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,320
Notice in chapter five, my son, attend

149
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,960
unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear

150
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,200
to my understanding. I like that. In my mind's eye, my sanctified imagination,

151
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,120
when I read Proverbs 5, in verse number one, and I see the

152
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,280
expression to bow thine eye,

153
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,320
or excuse me, thine ear, to my understanding.

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,520
That purposed hearing and listening.

155
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,840
Bow thine ear to my understanding. Notice in chapter number seven,

156
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,480
in verses one through three, my son, keep my words and lay up my commandments with

157
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,880
thee.

158
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,920
Keep my commandments and live in my law as the apple of thine eye.

159
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,640
Bind them upon thy fingers. Write them upon the table of thine heart.

160
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,320
If you skip down to verse number 24, it says, hearken unto me now, therefore,

161
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,080
O ye children, and attend to the words, what does it say?

162
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,640
Of my mouth. The message of his lips.

163
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,960
We notice here that Solomon, no doubt, had instructed his children,

164
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,280
specifically Rehoboam, in focus here within the context of the book of Proverbs,

165
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,800
and we find that he's given them the message of his lips, and I'm thankful

166
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,120
that I can understand biblically as we make the spiritual application

167
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,240
that our Heavenly Father has given us

168
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,840
a written word. It's a perfect book.

169
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,840
It is a preserved book. It is a powerful book.

170
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,280
The Bible tells us that it is a profitable book. Amen?

171
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,720
And we look at the Word of God. It is precious.

172
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
The psalmist says, yea, more to be desired are they than

173
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,400
gold, yea, than much fine gold. The instruction that we've received, the

174
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,600
written Word of God. I understand that God's not speaking to

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,680
us audibly, but you know it'd be a good idea for us as we sit down and read the

176
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,120
Word of God to act as if God is speaking these

177
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,480
words to us, because the Bible says all Scripture is

178
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,720
given by inspiration. What does the word mean?

179
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,840
God breathed. Amen? And if all Scripture is given by

180
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,360
inspiration of God, we're thankful that we have the written Word of God that's

181
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,320
been preserved for us, but our Father, can I tell you, He's

182
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,880
given us good doctrine. I mean, that's what He says in verse

183
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,840
number two. He says, for I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

184
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Listen, we understand the instruction of the book of Proverbs.

185
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Can I tell you that God has given us good doctrine?

186
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,320
In the same verse of Scripture in 1 Timothy chapter number four, when the

187
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,880
Bible says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

188
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,000
we find that it tells us that it's profitable for

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
doctrine. Amen? And we understand doctrine's important. You say, but

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,200
doctrine divides. Then so be it. Don't think I'm looking for fights or

191
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,120
anything like that, but I'm just saying, doctrine is important. Amen?

192
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,920
We cannot, we must not embrace the ideas of some of our liberal brethren that

193
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,640
have the ecumenical idea that we can set aside doctrine and seek

194
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,880
to have unity in the things that we agree on. It

195
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,520
doesn't work. It does not work, brethren. It's not

196
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,560
possible. What gives us unity is that we support

197
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,960
and embrace the same truth. God is the one that gives us unity

198
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,960
as we embrace this book. Amen? Notice the message of His lips

199
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,240
as we've mentioned here in Proverbs 4, but I want you to think about the

200
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,720
message of His life. We don't necessarily see it here within

201
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,720
the context of Proverbs 4. We do find that He mentions in

202
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,880
verses 3 and 4 how that He, Solomon,

203
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,440
received instruction from his father David,

204
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,960
and He says to him in verse 4, He taught me also and said unto me,

205
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,120
let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments, and live.

206
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,800
In fact, if you were to study the life of Solomon prior to

207
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,720
the situation with all that took place with all of his wives and concubines and

208
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,520
all of the idolatry that is recorded, you find that He walked with the Lord.

209
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,760
You know, if you look at the first 20 years of the reign of Solomon

210
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,240
as the King of Israel, and you look at the building of His own

211
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,040
house, and then the building of the temple, and you see all that's taking

212
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,120
place, you find in those passages of Scripture,

213
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,320
what did Solomon ask for when the Lord appeared to him? Wisdom.

214
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,520
Give me understanding that I might lead

215
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,520
your people. I mean, you look at some amazing things and the influence of

216
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,120
David and his life in his early years, and I'm thankful for that, but I want you

217
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,000
to notice what Solomon says in Proverbs 23 and verse number 26.

218
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,360
We'll get back to chapter number four here in just a moment, but I want you to

219
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,040
see what is said here, and it's so

220
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,240
powerful, and it's so important for us to understand,

221
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,160
and it goes right along with what I mentioned in Deuteronomy chapter number

222
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,800
six, the instruction that Moses gave to the

223
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,000
fathers. Listen, you have to know the truth. You have to live the truth,

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,080
and then you propagate the truth. You deliver the truth.

225
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,160
If you miss B, you have a hard time with C.

226
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,680
If you're not living the truth, you have a hard time

227
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,520
teaching the truth. Many times we'll be viewed as being hypocritical.

228
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,840
Amen? Why? Because you're telling me to do something that you aren't

229
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,080
doing yourself. We find in Proverbs 23 and verse number

230
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,680
26, the wise man says, my son,

231
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,160
give me thine heart, but notice the rest of the verse,

232
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:40,840
and let thine eyes observe my ways. I wonder how many times I've read

233
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,560
that verse of Scripture, and I've wondered

234
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:50,200
this truth I don't need to request of or grant permission to anybody to

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,960
observe my ways. What do I mean by that? My ways are

236
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,760
being observed anyway. My children in particular, they're

237
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,040
observing my ways, and it must be that the message of my

238
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,760
life is in line with the message of my lips.

239
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,880
When I think about this truth spiritually, it causes me to rejoice

240
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,680
greatly. If I could adopt the words of Brother

241
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Hummel, he said, I hear, I feel a preaching, a shout coming on, right?

242
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,000
And the reality is that we have the written Word of God,

243
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,280
but we have the living Word of God. John chapter number one, in the beginning

244
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,600
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

245
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Verse number 14, the Word became flesh and dwelt

246
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,480
among us. We have the living Word of God. Jesus Christ said, I am the way, the

247
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,920
truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by

248
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
Me. Jesus said often during His earthly

249
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,480
ministry to His disciples in particular, you see it in the

250
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,760
call of His disciples, He would use these two words,

251
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,520
follow Me. We find that as He's speaking about being His disciple,

252
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,559
He says that we're to deny ourselves, we're to take up our cross, and we are to

253
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,880
follow Him. Amen? The reality is, I believe

254
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,640
that one of the reasons in which we struggle so greatly with following the

255
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,080
Lord Jesus Christ is because we've not first denied ourselves

256
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,600
and we've not, number two, taken up His cross.

257
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,200
It's going to be a hard thing for me to follow Christ if I'm not denying myself.

258
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,200
Look at what Peter says in 1 Peter. You don't need to turn there, I'll read it

259
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,120
for you, but in 1 Peter chapter number two,

260
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
in verse number 21, the Bible says this. Now think about Peter.

261
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,240
Peter walked with Christ. Amen? He saw the life of the Savior. He saw the

262
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,320
Messiah. He walked with them. Peter is there at

263
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,080
the mount of transfiguration. I mean, Peter has experienced amazing things in

264
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,760
his life as he was an eyewitness. John uses that

265
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
terminology in 1 John chapter number one,

266
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,640
how that we are eyewitnesses of these things.

267
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,560
And we find that Peter says this in 1st Peter 2 and verse number 21 for even here unto where you called

268
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,840
Because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example

269
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
That you should follow his steps

270
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,600
So we have as we think about the responsibility of the father

271
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,280
Can I tell you that there are times in which as a father I have failed physically speaking

272
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,800
I have failed to give the proper instruction the words of my lips have not been appropriate perhaps and giving the instruction that I need

273
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,520
To give the message of my life. Maybe has failed from time to time and if we'd be honest we understand

274
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,840
We're not perfect

275
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,880
But can I tell you that God has perfectly fulfilled the responsibility that he laid upon himself to give us

276
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,480
Good doctrine to give us instruction

277
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,120
To give us direction for our lives

278
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,040
So often we find that people are searching and they're looking and they want direction and they just want to know what God wants them

279
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
To do get into the book

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,120
The book gives us the truth the book gives us the answers

281
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
Amen

282
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,400
We're looking in the wrong places sometimes

283
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,040
We're looking for direction and counsel from the wrong source

284
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,120
In fact, I'll be dealing with that tonight in our message. Come back. You'll love it. Amen. It'd be great. Praise the Lord

285
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
God's given us good doctrine

286
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,520
He's given us the written Word of God

287
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,640
He promised that he'd preserve his word and he has and for that we ought to rejoice

288
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
But he's also given us the living Word

289
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
when God

290
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Became man. He's the God man. You read Philippians chapter number two, and it just kind of blows your mind

291
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,560
We understand as we've even studied through the book of Hebrews

292
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,000
the truth of the incarnation of our Messiah and the fact that he lived a perfect sinless life for those

293
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Three or so years a little over three years upon this sin curse world and what do you do?

294
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,080
He left us an example

295
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,240
you read the gospel records and I hope as you read Matthew Mark Luke and John and you begin to read about the life and

296
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,760
Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and you see how he behaved. Listen, I understand that at times we use these cute little cliches

297
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,720
What would Jesus do most people that wear a band around their wrist that says?

298
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,100
WWJD or they have it on the back of their car. They don't know what Jesus would do because they've not read this book

299
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm what I feel like preaching this morning. I

300
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
mean seriously

301
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,040
How is it that we have been given not only the perfect Word of God?

302
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,560
But we've been given the example of God in flesh and yet so often we fail to receive the instruction

303
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
To hear the instruction

304
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,040
See because we see as it's described in chapter number four the book of Proverbs

305
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,820
It's the instruction of a father. It's good doctrine

306
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,000
It's in the way of wisdom according to verse number 10

307
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,840
Notice what he says in verse 10 and 11 in the passage of scripture that we're looking at this morning

308
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,680
He tells us this truth

309
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,960
He says here

310
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of my life shall be many notice verse number 10

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,960
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom

312
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,840
You know that our God is the all-wise God

313
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,600
We use the word to describe his wisdom that he is

314
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Omniscient he's all-knowing

315
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,680
He said if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God. Why would we ask God because he has all wisdom

316
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,040
Amen, that's why he doesn't tell us to go ask somebody else

317
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,440
I'm kind of glad he didn't tell you to go ask the pastor. I

318
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,840
Don't have all wisdom, but I know the one who does and

319
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,300
When people do ask me for counsel, I seek and purpose to give counsel that is based upon the truth of this book

320
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Doesn't matter what my opinion is

321
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
matters what God says

322
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,160
Notice what he says not only have I led thee in the way of wisdom

323
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,360
I are taught thee in the way of wisdom, but notice the end of verse number 11

324
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,160
I have led thee notice what it says in right

325
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,480
Paths can I tell you this morning that God will never lead you wrong?

326
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
You may lead yourself wrong

327
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,200
You may deceive yourself and you may lead yourself wrong you may justify some things

328
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
But God will never lead you wrong

329
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,080
Can I tell you this morning that the Holy Spirit of God will never lead you to do something contrary to the written Word of God?

330
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
He won't

331
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,000
God is leading us in right paths

332
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,160
He's given us the truth and I'm so thankful this morning to find how that yes

333
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:53,200
we can look at Solomon and we can look at Rehoboam and we can look at this physical relationship of father and son and we

334
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,560
Can rejoice in the responsibility that he understood and that he fulfilled

335
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,280
But when I look at it from a spiritual perspective and I understand that I'm a child of God and he's my heavenly father

336
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
And oh, he's a good father

337
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,920
He's given me good doctrine he has given me truth

338
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,080
We find the response of children number two

339
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
the responsibility of the father

340
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,600
The response of children notice again as we look at our passage of scripture in verse number one notice these words

341
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,880
Here ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding notice again in verse number 10

342
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,080
Hear oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many

343
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,360
You know

344
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,760
The reality is that we will understand as we look at the passage of scripture

345
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,480
this truth of hearing the purpose in which these words are used throughout the book of Proverbs of

346
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,560
Hearing is not so that you can just gain some level of understanding, but it's so that you would apply the truth in your life

347
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,920
So often we speak about being doers of the word and not hearers only

348
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,640
But can I tell you that Jesus said on more than one occasion he that hath an ear let him hear

349
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,680
We find it in the letters that are written to the churches in

350
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,400
There in Asia in the book of Revelation chapters 2 and 3 he mentions often about hearing

351
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,960
You're not gonna do it if you've not heard it

352
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,040
You're not just gonna like accidentally obey God

353
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,720
We're at enmity with God

354
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,280
We get saved and we get sanctified through the truth of the Word of God and we

355
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,840
Understand the response of a children of the children listen

356
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,920
We need to hear the Word of God so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God

357
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,640
It is good to sit under the sound of the preaching of the Word of God

358
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,680
I'm glad that you're here this morning. Amen, honestly

359
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
I

360
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,760
I'm glad that I thank God regularly. I don't fully understand it. In fact, I argued with God about it

361
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,320
I don't understand why he called me to the ministry. I

362
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,600
Really don't I don't understand why but I'm thankful he did and I'm thankful that he's enabled me

363
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,440
But the reality is that we need to hear the Word of God

364
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,560
We need to hear the truth. We need to hear the instruction of a father and he's given us good instruction

365
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,800
He's given us the Word of God

366
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,500
We find that it says in verse number two this for I give you good doctrine notice this response of the children

367
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Forsake ye not my law

368
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,080
It's a sad thing when a child of God says yeah, but that doesn't apply to me

369
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,880
We better be careful forsake ye not my law

370
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,280
God's given us his word. He's given us good doctrine. Oh

371
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,480
That was for a different culture you understand the Bible is cross-cultural

372
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
It works in any country of the world

373
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Why because he's the God of the universe

374
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,240
Amen and

375
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,600
We find here that as we continue to think about the response of the children notice in verse number seven

376
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Wisdom is the principal thing

377
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,680
therefore

378
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
get wisdom and

379
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:20,920
With all by getting get understanding what's the picture that you see in verse number seven? There's some work some effort

380
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,200
To get wisdom to get understanding to you know what Jesus said in John chapter number five

381
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,040
He said let me read it to you because I'm gonna not quote it properly because I wasn't planning to reference this verse of scripture

382
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,119
But in John 5 in verse number 39, he says search the scriptures why for in them you think

383
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,880
They have eternal life, but then he says this they are they which testify of me

384
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,840
You know what Jesus did in Luke chapter number 24 when he walked with those disciples

385
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:59,119
That were going back to Emmaus. He started at Moses and the prophets and he's found expounded all things

386
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
concerning himself

387
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,840
This morning as we understand this truth of wisdom being the principal thing and the

388
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,239
Wiseman saying therefore

389
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,600
Listen if wisdom is the principal thing and it is based upon the authority of the Word of God

390
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
therefore get wisdom

391
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,940
It's not just gonna fall out of the sky and land on your lap

392
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
You know, you got to dig into this book

393
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
There are times in which I read passages of scripture, I don't know how many times I

394
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,200
Was gonna preach through the book of Hebrews this year and I'm working on it

395
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm working on it, but prior to preaching through the book of Hebrews

396
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,040
I don't know how many times I read the book of Hebrews over my walk with God

397
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
But I know that I purposefully

398
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
read the book of Hebrews

399
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,760
37 times between October and December in

400
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
preparation of the messages on the book of Hebrews

401
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,800
Just in its entirety, just starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter 13.

402
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,400
And the next day, starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter number 13.

403
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,000
And then, as I preach and prepare the messages,

404
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you know how many times I read the passage that I'm going to preach?

405
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
I can't number it for you.

406
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Why? I'm trying to get it. I want to understand it.

407
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,800
I want to dig into the Word of God.

408
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
There are passages of Scripture...

409
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,300
Have you ever come across a passage and say, I'm not sure what that means?

410
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,500
Come on, if you haven't, I need to talk to you.

411
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,700
And maybe you need to come up here and preach.

412
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,200
But there are times in which you come to a passage of Scripture and say,

413
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,800
God, I don't know what you mean.

414
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,900
I don't know what you're trying to tell me.

415
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,300
I don't understand the truth that you're trying to reveal.

416
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,200
And you wrestle with it, and you work, and you work, and you work.

417
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,100
And the Holy Spirit of God, who's our Teacher, He reveals truth to us.

418
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,000
The Bible's awesome.

419
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,300
But we've got to work. We've got to work.

420
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,600
The Bible tells us to study to show thyself approved unto God.

421
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,700
A workman, amen, that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth.

422
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,700
And we understand, listen, it's work.

423
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I had the privilege of visiting with someone this week,

424
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,900
and as I went to visit with them,

425
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,200
I noticed that there was some information there with regard to some memorization cards.

426
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,100
I thought, man, that's great. Working on memorizing the Word of God.

427
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,000
Began to have conversation about that particular thing that I saw.

428
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
And as we're talking about it, I said, you know, I get asked all the time,

429
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
how can you memorize Scripture?

430
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,500
And my consistent answer is W-O-R-K.

431
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,800
It takes work to memorize the Word of God.

432
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,900
It really does.

433
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:52,100
And the older you get, or the more you try to memorize, the more work it takes.

434
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,300
Just takes work.

435
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:01,900
Sometimes we forget that, but he says, get wisdom, get understanding, labor for it, work for it.

436
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,300
Notice what he says back in Proverbs 4, in verse number 13,

437
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,600
take fast hold of instruction.

438
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean, does your mind, when you read these words,

439
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,300
does it not give you some pictures, some images of what we're to do?

440
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Take fast hold of this instruction.

441
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,900
He says this, notice, let her not go.

442
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,100
Can I tell you that if you found truth in the Word of God,

443
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,800
you better not let it go for anything.

444
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't care who comes down the road.

445
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
I don't care what they try to teach.

446
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,300
If you have the truth of the Word of God, you better hold on to it.

447
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Don't compromise on it.

448
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
Don't change.

449
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,400
No, no, let's search the Scriptures, let's understand what the Word of God says.

450
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,100
And we find, he says, take fast hold here of instruction.

451
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,700
Let her not go.

452
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Keep her, for she is thy life.

453
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,200
In Proverbs 13, in verse number 1, the Bible says,

454
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,900
a wise son heareth his father's instruction.

455
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,700
But I want you to think about that truth and couple it with chapter 28, in verse number 7,

456
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,500
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son.

457
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,200
So now listen, if you look at Proverbs 13, in verse number 1,

458
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,700
it says a wise son heareth his father's instruction.

459
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
So we get some information about a wise son.

460
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,400
What does he do? He hears the instruction.

461
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,500
But we understand some more information about a wise son in Proverbs 28, in verse number 7,

462
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,300
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son.

463
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,100
So it's not just hearing, it's keeping, it's doing.

464
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,300
We think about the application for us this morning.

465
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,400
We see the truth that God's given us good doctrine.

466
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,700
He's given us the written Word of God. He's given us the living Word of God.

467
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,600
And how is it that we respond?

468
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,000
Are we hearing the instruction?

469
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,900
Are we understanding that this book is profitable?

470
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,100
That I need the content of this book every day of my life?

471
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,500
I don't just need the Bible when I have a problem.

472
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,500
In fact, if we get a regular routine of getting into the Word of God,

473
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,000
then maybe when the problem comes, we already have the answer.

474
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,300
Why? Because God's been preparing me. God's been feeding me. He's sustaining me.

475
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,000
And that problem comes, we say, man, God, I'm so thankful

476
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that You gave me that truth that I read just a few days ago.

477
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,600
You knew that I needed that, because You knew what was coming in my life.

478
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,700
That's how God works. Now, sometimes He lets something come

479
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,800
that we didn't have that preparation for.

480
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,700
And we search the book. We get into the Word of God.

481
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,800
God, help me. Give me wisdom.

482
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Notice the result. We see the responsibility of the Father,

483
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,700
the response of the children. Notice the result. I love it.

484
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,000
The Bible tells us several things within the passage in Proverbs 4.

485
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
In verse 6, notice first of all it says this,

486
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee.

487
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Love her, and she shall keep thee.

488
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,800
Wisdom is in reference here as we look at the portion of Scripture.

489
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,700
And we notice, wisdom shall preserve thee.

490
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,000
You know that God's instruction as we hear it and as we obey it,

491
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
that it protects and guards us from troubles and evils?

492
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,800
It does. God's designed it that way.

493
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,000
Listen, as a father, humanly speaking,

494
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,500
are there some things that you instructed your children with

495
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,500
so that it would keep them, protect them, preserve them

496
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
from some troubles and evils?

497
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Sure. Why did you tell them not to play in the middle of the road?

498
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Because it's dangerous.

499
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I was chatting with somebody just yesterday,

500
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
and I was talking to them about the dangers of outlets

501
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,600
and how almost every child I've ever witnessed

502
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,800
somehow or another has a magnet for a wall outlet.

503
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
It's amazing.

504
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
It's like it's just calling their name.

505
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Somebody's made a lot of money on that

506
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
by getting all those covers and all those things,

507
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,000
and then you get the covers that are child-proof

508
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,800
and you can't get the crazy things out to be able to use the outlet.

509
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Amen, Joseph?

510
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
He said to me the other day,

511
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
how do you get this crazy thing out of here anyway?

512
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
It's kid-proof. No, just kidding.

513
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,400
The reality is that when I said that to the individual,

514
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,800
they said, man, I'm going to protect all of my outlets

515
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,200
because I don't want my kid putting something in there.

516
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Yeah, why?

517
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Because you're trying to protect them.

518
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,600
And when you tell Johnny or Susie, don't put it in there,

519
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,400
you're trying to keep them, to preserve them.

520
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,200
So guess what?

521
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,000
When God gives us the instruction that He's given us,

522
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,600
when we hear it and when we follow it,

523
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,000
can I tell you that one of the results that we see here in Proverbs 4

524
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,400
is that it will protect and guard us from any troubles and evils?

525
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,600
The reality is that it shall preserve thee.

526
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,400
There are some things that we just understand biblically

527
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,200
that we take and make decisions based on.

528
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
There are some things I'm not going to do,

529
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
some places I'm not going to go, so on and so forth.

530
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Why? Because there's biblical command and it's preserved me.

531
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
It has. Amen?

532
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,400
If you'd be honest, I hope that you could say it's preserved you.

533
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
Because that's what the Word of God says.

534
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,000
If you hear it and you keep it, it shall preserve thee.

535
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,800
It's going to keep us, it's going to protect us and guard us.

536
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Number two, what is the result that we see?

537
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
In verse 8 and 9, notice it says,

538
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Exalt her and she shall promote thee.

539
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,000
She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her.

540
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace,

541
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,800
a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.

542
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
I see here in verses 8 and 9 that wisdom shall promote thee.

543
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,000
And really in my mind's eye, I see the truth of blessings.

544
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You know what, and we're going to look at the passage,

545
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Lord willing we'll have time.

546
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,200
In Deuteronomy, actually we won't look in there,

547
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,000
we'll skip that, I don't have time.

548
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But in Deuteronomy 11, let me just give you what it says.

549
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This day what I do, I lay before you a blessing and a curse.

550
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Right? Is that what the Bible says?

551
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
Those of you that are familiar with Deuteronomy 11,

552
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,600
it's what it says.

553
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,000
A blessing if you obey.

554
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,200
A curse if you disobey.

555
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
I mean, it's pretty straightforward, right?

556
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
And so guess what?

557
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,800
God has attached in His Word blessings to obedience.

558
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,600
It's just the truth.

559
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,200
Why is it that we have the blessing,

560
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
the certainty of heaven?

561
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Because we obeyed the Gospel.

562
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,800
Amen?

563
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
We heard the Gospel, we believed it,

564
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
we accept that Christ is our Savior.

565
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Because Jesus Christ died on the cross for us,

566
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
He was buried, He rose in victory,

567
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,000
and we understood that truth and it was delivered to us,

568
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,600
and we obeyed the truth of the Word of God.

569
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
We obeyed the Gospel.

570
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,800
But throughout our lives, we think about when we exalt wisdom,

571
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,400
when we are hearing and doing and following the instruction

572
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,600
or understanding that God has given us the written Word of God,

573
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,400
He's given us the living Word of God,

574
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,800
that the blessings are going to come.

575
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,600
This evening when we deal with the subject matter

576
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
in which we're going to deal with,

577
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
we'll see it particularly in the passage

578
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,200
that we'll be dealing with tonight.

579
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,600
Number three, notice in verse 10,

580
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,800
"'Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings,

581
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,600
and the years of thy life shall be many.'"

582
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
The Bible says the way of the transgressor is hard.

583
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,400
We find that as we look at this,

584
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,200
and we understand the longevity, length of, and quality of life.

585
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,800
You know, I'm so thankful for the truth of eternal life.

586
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I really am.

587
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I am so thankful for the promise that the Bible says.

588
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
The Bible tells us that the gift of God is eternal life

589
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,360
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

590
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,260
John 6 and verse 23, what a blessing.

591
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,680
But can I tell you that in John 10 and verse number 10,

592
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,200
he tells us that he came to give us life

593
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,080
and that we might have it more abundant.

594
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,120
You know, he's given us the truth of the word of God

595
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,640
that we can have not only length of days,

596
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,020
but we can have quality of days, abundant life.

597
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm thankful that we have everlasting life

598
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,600
and the truth of God's gift of salvation,

599
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,880
but we have that abundant life, that quality of life.

600
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,260
Not only do we see these three items,

601
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,600
notice in verse number 12,

602
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,640
as we think about a fourth result,

603
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,560
the Bible tells us when thou goest,

604
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,240
now understood contextually,

605
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,320
you're going in the way that I've guided you.

606
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,360
You're going with the truth that I've given you.

607
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,780
You've heard the instruction.

608
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,440
You've received the instruction.

609
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,960
You're doing the word of God.

610
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,560
You're obeying the truth that I've given you.

611
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,600
Then when you go, thy step shall not be straightened,

612
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,120
and when thou runnest, thou shall not stumble.

613
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
The idea there of thy step shall not be straightened

614
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,240
has the idea of being impeded.

615
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,360
And we understand that it says

616
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,680
that when thou runnest, thou shall not stumble.

617
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm thankful that the truth of God's word

618
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
will prevent us from dealing

619
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,000
with some of the pitfalls of life.

620
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,040
Some of the obstacles and hardships

621
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,600
that life can bring our way,

622
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,040
we can avoid those things.

623
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,680
We can be delivered,

624
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,040
preventing us from having to endorse

625
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,880
some of those things.

626
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,760
Why? Because we've taken heed to the instruction.

627
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,080
Now, I'm not saying to you this morning

628
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,640
that you'll avoid every trouble,

629
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,440
because we understand that there are times

630
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,000
in which actively obeying God's instruction

631
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
leads you directly into a storm.

632
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
You say, pastor, you're crazy.

633
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,160
No, just look at the disciples.

634
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
It was God in flesh, Jesus Christ,

635
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,600
that said get in a boat and go over the Sea of Galilee,

636
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,120
and they got in the boat, and they got in,

637
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,240
and they had a storm.

638
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,960
They were obedient.

639
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,000
They weren't disobedient.

640
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,360
I mentioned on Wednesday evening

641
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,600
as we spoke about the when we shall see Christ,

642
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
another title of the song,

643
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,880
when we see Christ, when we see Jesus.

644
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,840
Man, what a blessing.

645
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
I love the song.

646
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,600
I think Ms. Joyce, she's asked me a couple of times,

647
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,800
at my funeral, I want that song.

648
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,960
Amen?

649
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
Why?

650
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,320
Because she understands

651
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,080
that when she takes her final breath here,

652
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,720
that she'll be immediately in heaven with her Savior,

653
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
and she'll see Him face to face, and what a blessing.

654
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,280
But the song talks about

655
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,240
when all of life's trials are passed.

656
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,720
And I mentioned this on Wednesday evening.

657
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,560
Those of you that were here,

658
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,240
some that were watching via live stream,

659
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,840
I made the statement that the troubles and trials,

660
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,680
the storms of life,

661
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,800
I'm so thankful that one day they will soon be over.

662
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,080
They will all be over.

663
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,280
And what a blessing.

664
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
But can I tell you that sometimes

665
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
we must come to this understanding

666
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
that in the midst of the storms,

667
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,400
God has a purpose,

668
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,960
that He would be glorified,

669
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,000
that we would be developed

670
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,240
in the very midst of the storms.

671
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,080
God's in control.

672
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,600
Do we believe that God's in control?

673
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,400
If He is,

674
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
if we are following His instruction,

675
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
if we're doing what He's told us to do,

676
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,720
if we're being good receivers of instruction,

677
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,160
if we're responding properly,

678
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,440
then He's going to give us that guidance

679
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,840
and direction that we need.

680
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,640
And we see these results

681
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,360
and what blessed results they are.

682
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,680
Oftentimes when we look at the results,

683
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,080
whether contextually

684
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,760
in what we're dealing with this morning,

685
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,080
or maybe some other area of life,

686
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,080
we say, yep, I want those results.

687
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,640
We know what the problem is?

688
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,400
We don't want the process.

689
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,240
We're an instant society.

690
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,520
Amen?

691
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,280
But to get the results,

692
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,360
we must follow the process.

693
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,840
We must hear and receive.

694
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,560
We must respond properly.

695
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,720
The truth of the matter

696
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,560
is that this book sitting on a shelf

697
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
somewhere all week and collecting dust,

698
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,600
though it is the most important,

699
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,040
most profitable book in all of the world,

700
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,400
it's doing you nothing.

701
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,160
Because you're not reading it.

702
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,000
You're not following it.

703
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,440
You're not obeying it.

704
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,080
I think, I don't remember who it was,

705
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,480
I think it might have been Charles Ryrie.

706
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,360
It might have been somebody else,

707
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,080
so don't fact check me on it

708
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,360
because I'm telling you up front,

709
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,520
I can't remember exactly who it was that said it.

710
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,160
But he said this,

711
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,360
on one page of Scripture,

712
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,640
I have more life transforming truth

713
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,000
than in all of the volumes

714
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,320
of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

715
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,960
I thought, man, I like his perspective.

716
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,440
I do.

717
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,560
Now, you young people,

718
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,680
I know you don't have volumes

719
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,960
of Encyclopedia Britannica

720
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,520
because we have Wikipedia

721
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
and they stopped actually printing it

722
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
a number of years ago,

723
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,360
but the reality is that God's Word

724
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,120
is full of good instruction, good doctrine,

725
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,840
and oh, that we just hear it and receive it.

726
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,600
Let me close with two passages of Scripture,

727
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,480
Psalm 19.

728
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,200
We're familiar with Psalm 19.

729
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,960
The Bible begins with,

730
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,440
the heavens declare the glory of God,

731
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,760
the firmament showeth forth His handiwork.

732
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,120
What a blessing.

733
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,560
Think about the beauty of creation,

734
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,360
how it reveals there's a Creator.

735
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,480
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

736
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,720
it quickly moves from the truth of creation

737
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,440
to the truth of God's written Word.

738
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,680
Of course, as we think about this passage

739
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,520
being the Old Testament,

740
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,720
the law of the Lord, the books of Moses,

741
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,560
we find that the Bible begins in verse number seven.

742
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,360
It says, the law of the Lord is perfect,

743
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,720
converting the soul.

744
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,960
The testimony of the Lord is sure,

745
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,200
making wise the simple.

746
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,600
The statutes of the Lord are right,

747
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,160
rejoicing the heart.

748
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,440
The commandment of the Lord is pure,

749
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,360
enlightening the eyes.

750
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,520
The fear of the Lord is clean,

751
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,200
enduring forever.

752
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,560
The judgments of the Lord are true

753
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,640
and righteous altogether.

754
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,360
More to be desired they than gold,

755
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,320
yea, than much fine gold.

756
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,080
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

757
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,680
Moreover, don't miss verse number 11,

758
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,280
moreover, by them.

759
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,120
What is them?

760
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,600
What's he been referring to the whole time?

761
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,360
The law of the Lord.

762
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,840
By them, by the truth of the Word of God,

763
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,320
is thy servant warned.

764
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,520
You hear, unfortunately, a generation today,

765
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,040
I just don't like church and the Bible

766
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,200
because it's got all those thou shalt nots.

767
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,360
I'm thankful God gave us a bunch of thou shalt nots.

768
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,440
You know why?

769
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,880
It's preserved me.

770
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,900
It's prevented me from dealing with some hardships.

771
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,960
Why?

772
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,320
Because God said thou shalt not.

773
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,920
God, I understand that in your wisdom

774
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,000
you told me not to do this,

775
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,440
and by your grace and with your help,

776
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,640
I'm not gonna do it.

777
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,920
Notice, by them is thy servant warned,

778
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,600
and in keeping of them,

779
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,120
there is great reward.

780
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,240
The keeping of them.

781
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,200
See, we're warned, but then we keep it.

782
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,240
Notice Deuteronomy chapter 30.

783
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,800
I preached short last week,

784
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,840
and I'm gonna preach longer today.

785
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,520
I'm not, I'm just teasing.

786
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,080
I didn't really preach short last week.

787
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,840
In fact, Joseph was doing the sound last week,

788
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,520
and he was rooting for me to go another minute longer

789
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,580
because I preached 58 and a half minutes.

790
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,140
I never preach that long.

791
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,240
But Hebrews chapter number seven

792
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,560
was just such a technical passage of scripture,

793
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,920
and I didn't wanna break it up,

794
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,120
and so I almost got to a full hour,

795
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,000
and he was cheering for just a little bit more, Daddy.

796
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,400
And so thank Joseph, amen?

797
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,420
He's not doing sound today,

798
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,340
but Deuteronomy chapter 30,

799
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,500
notice in verse number 10,

800
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,300
and I'll finish with this passage.

801
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,860
Notice the first word, if.

802
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,460
Deuteronomy 30 and verse number 10.

803
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,780
If.

804
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,560
It's an important word.

805
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,100
Just two letters in our English language,

806
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,660
but oh, what a message they carry.

807
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,660
If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

808
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,920
To keep his commandments and his statutes,

809
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,620
which are written in this book of the law.

810
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,440
And if, we see it again,

811
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,100
thou turn unto the Lord thy God

812
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,180
with all thine heart, with all thy soul.

813
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,980
For this commandment, which I command thee this day,

814
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,140
notice this, it is not hidden from thee,

815
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,980
neither is it far off.

816
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,180
Aren't you thankful that we have the word of God?

817
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,400
We have it.

818
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,300
I'm not saying this to pat myself on the back,

819
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,140
but you ought to be thankful

820
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,720
that you got a church and a pastor

821
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,660
that preaches the word of God.

822
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,940
Because the reality is that you can go long and far

823
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,780
around this nation

824
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,040
and you can find a dearth of good Bible preaching.

825
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm just saying, preach the Bible.

826
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,820
Notice verse number 12.

827
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,860
It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say,

828
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,640
who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us,

829
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,820
that we may hear it and do it.

830
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,220
Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say,

831
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,580
who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us,

832
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,040
that we may hear it and do it.

833
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,280
No, the reality is that if you want to hear it and do it,

834
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,620
it's available.

835
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,840
Some people say, if I just knew what to do.

836
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,280
Like all of the flashing lights and everything,

837
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,280
like if you just knew what to do, here you go.

838
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,000
Amen?

839
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,820
Notice verse 14, but the word is very nigh unto thee,

840
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,240
in thy mouth and thy heart thou shouldest,

841
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,620
that thou mayest do it.

842
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,260
See, I have set before thee this day,

843
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,060
life and good and death and evil.

844
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,780
In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God,

845
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,620
to walk in his ways, to keep his commandments

846
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,900
and his statutes and his judgments,

847
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,580
that thou mayest live and multiply.

848
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,900
And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land

849
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,540
whither thou goest to possess it.

850
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,460
But look, we see that word again, if.

851
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:57,420
But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear,

852
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,580
but shall be drawn away and worship other gods

853
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,420
and serve them,

854
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,260
I deny.

855
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,980
unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,

856
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,480
and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land,

857
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,100
whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

858
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,980
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you,

859
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,940
that I have set before you life and death, blessing

860
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,860
and cursing.

861
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:25,700
Therefore, choose life, that both thou and thy seed

862
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,540
may live, that thou mayest love the Lord thy God,

863
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,300
and that thou mayest obey His voice,

864
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,460
and that thou mayest cleave unto Him, for He is thy life,

865
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,540
the length of thy days, that thou mayest dwell in the land

866
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,340
which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,

867
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,980
and to Jacob, to give them."

868
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,780
The sad reality is that even as we've

869
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,060
studied through the book of Joshua,

870
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:52,780
we're in the midst of the land being divided

871
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,580
and the inheritance for each of the tribes,

872
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,980
and so on and so forth.

873
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,940
And we think about the passage of Scripture,

874
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,620
we think about the truth of the fullness of the book of Joshua,

875
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,100
they go into the land.

876
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,740
God brings them in.

877
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,780
God gave them warnings.

878
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,940
Joshua gives messages, the warnings

879
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,060
that are contained therein.

880
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,340
You know what the sad reality is?

881
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,780
They were judged because of their disobedience.

882
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,540
They didn't always stay in their land.

883
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,000
The promise of a remnant that returned after the Babylonian

884
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,180
captivity, I thank God that it happened.

885
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,920
But you understand, the Assyrians came in,

886
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,160
and a little while later, the Babylonians come in.

887
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,920
Why?

888
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,960
It wasn't because God wasn't able to preserve His people.

889
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,520
It was because His people forsook

890
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,040
the instruction He gave them.

891
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,520
They served idols.

892
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,560
They did all sorts of wickedness,

893
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,560
and the judgment of God came.

894
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,400
And they were warned of that.

895
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,440
And this morning, as we think about the instruction

896
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,440
of a father, I'm thankful for the instruction

897
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,560
that I received from my earthly father.

898
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,840
I'm thankful for the opportunity and the responsibility

899
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,720
that I have to give instruction to my children,

900
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,600
physically, humanly speaking.

901
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
I wish I could say I always responded properly

902
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,100
to the instruction I received from my father, but he's here,

903
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,320
and I'm not interested in lying.

904
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,680
I didn't always receive it properly.

905
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,720
And if you did, never mind.

906
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,280
Let me say this.

907
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,520
Biblically speaking, our God has given us

908
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,960
the written word of God.

909
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,640
He's given us good instruction, the instruction of a father,

910
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,400
our heavenly father.

911
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,520
It's good doctrine.

912
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,720
He said, how are you going to respond to it?

913
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,680
I said this in the beginning of the message this morning,

914
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,480
and I'm going to close with this thought.

915
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,640
Our lives, as God's people, as God's children,

916
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,920
our lives should be characterized by obedience

917
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,200
to the word of God.

918
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,040
Should be characterized by obedience to the word of God.

919
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,360
That we are doers of the word, not hearers only.

920
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,760
That we're digging into the book.

921
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,640
You know, I see statistics all the time.

922
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,160
I get periodicals and magazines.

923
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,320
I don't read half of them.

924
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,640
I don't have time.

925
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,120
Why?

926
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,160
Because I'd rather read the Bible than all that stuff,

927
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
and so I'm not going to change my Bible reading

928
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,400
time to read all of that.

929
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,640
But I do get a bunch of things, and I do read many of those.

930
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,200
And when you start reading the statistics of people

931
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,640
that claim to be Bible-believing regular attenders of church

932
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,520
that are asked the question, have you ever

933
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,920
read the Bible completely cover to cover,

934
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,120
and you see that a large percentage of them

935
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,660
say no, it's a problem.

936
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,360
And then when you say to the people that

937
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,820
say they do read it cover to cover,

938
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,440
and you say, OK, how many days a week do you read the Bible?

939
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,600
Do you have a plan?

940
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,240
Do you have an overwhelming majority of people

941
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,280
have no plan?

942
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,840
Now, I will readily admit I've never

943
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,300
been called by any of those people,

944
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,480
and I've never participated in the surveys.

945
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,520
And I understand statistics and the way they work

946
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,860
and how you can make them say what you want them to say,

947
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,160
but I would say there's a problem.

948
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,400
If that is any representation of reality,

949
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,840
and I'm sad to say that I'm sure it is,

950
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,040
then what God has given us as good instruction,

951
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,640
unfortunately, His people have said, I'm OK.

952
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,920
I'm going to figure this out myself.

953
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,640
It's not really for me.

954
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,360
And then we wander around, and we flounder around.

955
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,560
We deal with problems and troubles and difficulties,

956
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,880
and we wonder why.

957
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,080
God's given us His word.

958
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,200
Oh, that we would hear it and receive it,

959
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,960
and that we would get it, that we'd labor for it,

960
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,960
that we would hold onto it, lay hold of it, let it not go,

961
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,320
forsake it not, but be doers of the word.

962
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,040
The instruction of a father.

963
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,120
Humanly speaking, I'm thankful that Solomon

964
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,920
gave some instruction of Rehoboam.

965
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,720
Spiritually speaking, I'm thankful

966
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,320
that our Heavenly Father has given us a perfect book.

967
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,720
It's changed my life.

968
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,080
It's helped me in so many ways.

969
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,600
And I'm sure that you could stand and testify

970
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,280
of how the book has helped you as well.

971
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,800
Let's pray.

972
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,320
Father, we love you.

973
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,080
We thank you for loving us.

974
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,000
Thank you for this day, Father's Day,

975
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,760
that we can think about the responsibility,

976
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,640
humanly speaking, of instructing the children

977
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,880
that you would bless us with.

978
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,240
And Lord, what a blessing.

979
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,120
We're so thankful for that charge that we can receive.

980
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,000
Thankful for the truth with regard to the children,

981
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,040
how they respond to it.

982
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,640
Thank you for the results that you carry forth and show us

983
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,120
in your Word.

984
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,000
In a much greater, far more important aspect,

985
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,320
we understand that the book of Proverbs records for us

986
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,080
the instruction of our Heavenly Father

987
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,160
to us as your children.

988
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,320
And God, as we examine the truth of this passage of Scripture,

989
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,000
I pray that you'd help us to examine it

990
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,520
from that perspective.

991
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,840
This is God my Savior, my Father.

992
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm His son, His child, and He's given me this instruction.

993
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,440
Oh God, would you help us to have

994
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,040
our lives characterized by obedience to Thy Word?

995
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,560
We take the simplicity of that truth in John 2.

996
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,440
Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.

997
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,200
God, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

998
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,480
Help us, Lord, to understand the treasure that you've

999
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,440
given us in your Word.

1000
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,720
Just how powerful and profitable it is,

1001
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,520
how it gives us the answers for all of life's questions.

1002
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,320
Lord, help us to roll up our sleeves and labor, work,

1003
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:51,280
dig in to get the wisdom that you have for us.

1004
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,780
I pray that this morning, if there's

1005
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,440
one that's not sure of heaven, whether they're here locally

1006
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,840
or they're tuned in via the live stream,

1007
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,680
I pray they'd understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, God

1008
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,040
in flesh, died for them, was buried in a borrowed tomb,

1009
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,200
and rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

1010
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,160
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

1011
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,920
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

1012
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,360
The Holy Spirit of God would convict you

1013
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,760
of sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

1014
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,680
to come.

1015
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,440
Maybe this morning there's one that says,

1016
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,360
I've never been saved.

1017
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,600
I don't know.

1018
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,000
The Lord is my Savior.

1019
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,720
Would you trust Him today?

1020
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,720
Today is the day of salvation.

1021
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,040
Understand there's nothing good that you can do.

1022
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,840
It's all in what Jesus did.

1023
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,520
Lord, I pray that you'd work in that individual's heart.

1024
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,160
We think about those that are here, Lord, that are saved.

1025
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,520
We're your children.

1026
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,320
Those that are logged on watching

1027
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,520
that are your children, God, would you

1028
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,160
help us to receive the instruction,

1029
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,800
obey the instruction?

1030
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,240
Help us, Lord, to recognize what we

1031
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,680
have in the written word of God, in the living word of God,

1032
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,240
the Lord Jesus Christ.

1033
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,200
There would not be just some cliche

1034
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,160
that we throw around of what would Jesus do,

1035
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,000
but that through studying thy written word

1036
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,200
and studying the life of Christ through the Gospels,

1037
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,840
that we would have an understanding of how He

1038
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,640
behaved, what He did, that we might follow His example.

1039
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,200
Help us, Lord.

1040
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,480
Work in and through our lives.

1041
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,640
We'll thank you for the decisions that will be made,

1042
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,880
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1043
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,680
Would you stand with me?

1044
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,760
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1045
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,800
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

1046
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,300
Maybe you want to pray in your seat.

1047
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,960
Maybe you want to pray in your chair.
