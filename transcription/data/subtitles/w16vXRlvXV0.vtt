00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
For Proverbs chapter number four and as you're turning there

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.340
We're looking at verses 1 through 13 from this passage of Scripture many countries around the world observe Father's Day

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:17.520
The specific date varies. In fact, a lot of countries will celebrate Father's Day today the third Sunday in June

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.520
Of course, that's when we as the United States of America, that's when we observe Father's Day

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.280
But we find that in many regions of the world

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.560
there are many countries that observe a day on their calendar each and every year to recognize Father's Day and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.560
That date may vary but here of course as I mentioned a moment ago today is Father's Day

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.680
In the United States the first observance that we can tell from what we look at in history was in June of 1910 out in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.560
Washington State in fact and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.799
It kind of went on for a little while and some of the clergy members to use that term

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.759
As it was used in the particular article they made decisions that they would preach a message on fathers and they would

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.400
Address it in in like fashion is what they had done with Mother's Day and what have you?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.519
but it would did not become a permanent national holiday until 1972 and

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.800
That really isn't that long ago, of course for a number of years

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.919
It was observed before, you know from 1910 until 1972, but it was not an official

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.440
Holiday in the United States of America until made a permanent national holiday until 1972

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.720
the purpose as it stated is this to honor fatherhood and paternal bonds as well as the influence of fathers in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.599
society

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.919
The reality is that as we go to the Word of God

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.839
We find that back in the book of Deuteronomy in the sixth chapter that Moses gave very specific

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.800
Instruction to the role of fathers on influencing their families for the Lord and that responsibility was given

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:54.040
of course the children of Israel if you think about the book of Deuteronomy and obviously if you've been with us through the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.400
Study of the book of Joshua

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.360
You understand that Moses is preparing that generation for entrance into the land and all of the things that they would become

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.120
You know be able to see and all that they would conquer and the things that they would now be

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.220
Exposed to and so on and so forth and we find that God used Moses to give some very important

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.220
Instruction to that generation and as you read the sixth chapter in particular

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.100
There is very direct instruction that is given to fathers

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.020
It is interesting if you were to study that passage of Scripture that there is an emphasis

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
placed upon the fathers knowing the truth and living the truth and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.460
Then teaching the truth and by the way when we go in that order, we're much more effective

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.380
when our message of our life

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:45.940
Matches the message of our lips and that's why I think there's such an important emphasis that is placed in Deuteronomy chapter number six of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020
Those fathers knowing the truth

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.539
Living the truth and then teaching the truth as we look at the book of Proverbs

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.979
We have the opportunity from a human perspective. Obviously, it's the Word of God. It's divinely inspired

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.419
But humanly speaking we have the opportunity the privilege of you will to read of the instruction of a father

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:08.500
In fact, that's the title for the message this morning the instruction of a father

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.979
you'll see that in verse number one of chapter number four and it's interesting if we look at the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.740
Specifics as to what's taking place in the book of Proverbs. You see that Solomon is speaking to his children in particular

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:25.380
Rehoboam and we find that instruction is being given it's being passed on

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.979
In fact in our text of Scripture this morning in chapter number four

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:35.500
You'll find that Solomon references how that his father David taught him you can look at the passages of Scripture

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.460
At the end of the life of King David and you can see first Kings chapter number two in particular

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.779
you can see where he calls for

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.860
Solomon and he gives them instruction and we find that

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:53.960
Solomon here in the book of Proverbs is providing this instruction for his children in particular for Rehoboam

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But really there's a much greater

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.160
truth that is found within the book of Proverbs more than Solomon sitting down and speaking to his children or to his child we

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.839
find that God our Father is

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.320
Speaking truth to us as his children, you know, it's an absolute blessing to say I'm a child of God and

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.559
By the way, there are many people that make the claim that they're a child of God

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:24.000
And so let me help you understand that you can only be a child of God if you've been saved by the blood of the crucified

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.920
One there's some people that would like to purport this idea that we're all the children of God

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.760
We understand that God is the Creator

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:38.640
But you understand that you enter into that relationship of him being our father and we being his children

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.279
Only through redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:48.440
But as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:53.519
Amen, and what a blessing I'm so thankful for the truth of God's Word with regard to that

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:59.959
And so this morning as we study this passage of scripture in Proverbs chapter 4 and we know the instruction of a father

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:04.959
Will deal specifically with how Solomon is seeking to influence his children

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.040
But more broadly speaking we must not miss the the truth of the application that God our Father

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.320
Has given us instruction and we must take heed to it our lives

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.920
Should be characterized by obedience to the instruction of our father

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.920
Amen, our life should be characterized by

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.519
obedience to the instruction of our heavenly father

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:39.279
We see that truth that is revealed to us in the book of Proverbs with regard to the human relationship

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.679
Between Solomon and his son and about the importance of taking heed and obeying and following and keeping and so on and so forth

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:52.839
but on a much higher plane a much more important perspective is that we would

00:05:53.119 --> 00:06:01.079
understand that our heavenly father has given us instruction in this book that we call the Bible and all that our lives would be

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.880
characterized by obeying the word

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:11.880
Therefore this morning as we look at the passage of scripture. Yes, there is a charge to the fathers humanly speaking our

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.799
Responsibility there's a charge to the children their responsibility to receive the instruction that's been given to them

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.799
But really as we look at the the the application for each and every one of us say I'm not a father

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:27.640
I'm not a child living at home anymore. That's okay

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.399
Because if you're a child of God

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:36.640
There is rich truth in this passage of scripture for each and every one of us and I hope that we would make the decision

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.519
To say yes Lord. Yes, which one obey

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:47.000
I mentioned a passage of scripture not long ago. I don't remember exactly which message it was that I was preaching

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:50.959
It may have been a Joshua lesson for all I know. I'm not sure exactly

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:57.279
I didn't go back and look it up as to when I made the statement, but it was in John chapter number two at the

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.679
Miracle there at Cana and Mary comes to those

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:08.720
Servants and they say she says to them speaking of Jesus whatsoever. He saith unto you

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.920
Do it I love the simplicity of that statement

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.260
Isn't it? Isn't it? It's simple right whatsoever. He saith unto you

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:25.679
Do it and oh that we would have that perspective notice in our passage of scripture

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.640
The Bible says this I'll read the entirety and then we'll break it down this morning verse number one here

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.359
Ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.359
For I give you good doctrine

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:46.920
Forsaking not my law for I was my father's son tender and only beloved of the in the sight of my mother

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.959
He taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.519
Get wisdom get understanding

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.140
Forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.339
Love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principle thing

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:11.160
Therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.859
Exalt her wisdom and she shall promote thee

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:18.380
She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:24.100
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.459
Here, oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:33.299
I've taught thee in the way of wisdom

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:40.020
I have led thee in right paths when thou goest thy steps shall not be straightened and when thou runnest

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.419
Thou shalt not stumble take fast hold of instruction

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.419
Let her not go keep her for she is

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.599
Thy life now when we read this passage of scripture

00:08:54.479 --> 00:09:00.559
Strictly from the perspective of Solomon speaking to Rehoboam we say well, this is good instruction

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.039
Solomon didn't always follow the instruction he gave

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.880
Amen, in fact in my own personal Bible reading this morning the the place in which I started this morning

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:18.320
Just where I was was in first Kings dealing with how he Solomon loved many strange women and all that situation with the

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.000
Idolatry and what-have-you and so we find that if we read the passage of scripture strictly from that perspective

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.960
We'll glean some things but we won't glean the fullness of what we're looking at

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.080
if we take that perspective that God our Heavenly Father is

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:44.559
Giving us instruction and we understand we break down the passage of scripture. Oh how rich it becomes as

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:49.320
We look at the passage we see first of all the responsibility of the father

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:55.840
we understand that as I mentioned back in Deuteronomy chapter number 6 and we could look at the examples of

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:59.840
of those that were even recorded for us in the book of Genesis and

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.520
the instruction of Adam, no doubt, to his family, and you can deal with Noah, and

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.960
you can deal with Abraham, and so on and so forth, then

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.000
you can understand that there was a responsibility and there was a

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.800
fulfillment of responsibility in many of those cases

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.400
to give instruction, to teach

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.320
the children. As we think about the responsibility of the Father, I notice the

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.960
message of His lips.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.280
When I speak about His, specifically, contextually, dealing with Solomon,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.560
and we'll make the application, but notice what he says.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.800
Solomon says, hear ye children, notice the instruction of a father.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.280
Well, if they're gonna hear it, he's speaking it. Is that too far of a stretch?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Amen? And so, the message of his lips,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.880
the instruction that he's giving through his speech, he says,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.320
hear ye children, the instruction of the Father, and attend to no

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.200
understanding.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.040
Notice what he says, for I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.560
Notice that as we consider,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.880
he says again, in verse number 10, hear,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.920
O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.280
shall be many. And so, we see this idea of the message of His lips. In fact, if we

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.880
were to take a quick survey

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.480
through several chapters of the book of Proverbs, notice with me, in Proverbs

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480
chapter number one,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.440
in verse number eight, notice what the Bible says here in the first chapter of the book of

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.200
Proverbs.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.960
It says, my son, notice again, hear

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.880
the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.920
of thy mother. In chapter two, in verse number one,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.080
my son, if thou wilt receive

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.160
my words, and hide my commandments with thee.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.120
We notice in chapter three, in verse number one, my son, forget not my law,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.920
but let thine heart keep my commandments. We've read the passage in chapter number four.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.320
Notice in chapter five, my son, attend

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.960
unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.200
to my understanding. I like that. In my mind's eye, my sanctified imagination,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.120
when I read Proverbs 5, in verse number one, and I see the

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.280
expression to bow thine eye,

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.320
or excuse me, thine ear, to my understanding.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.520
That purposed hearing and listening.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.840
Bow thine ear to my understanding. Notice in chapter number seven,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.480
in verses one through three, my son, keep my words and lay up my commandments with

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.880
thee.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.920
Keep my commandments and live in my law as the apple of thine eye.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.640
Bind them upon thy fingers. Write them upon the table of thine heart.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.320
If you skip down to verse number 24, it says, hearken unto me now, therefore,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.080
O ye children, and attend to the words, what does it say?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.640
Of my mouth. The message of his lips.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.960
We notice here that Solomon, no doubt, had instructed his children,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.280
specifically Rehoboam, in focus here within the context of the book of Proverbs,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.800
and we find that he's given them the message of his lips, and I'm thankful

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.120
that I can understand biblically as we make the spiritual application

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.240
that our Heavenly Father has given us

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.840
a written word. It's a perfect book.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.840
It is a preserved book. It is a powerful book.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.280
The Bible tells us that it is a profitable book. Amen?

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.720
And we look at the Word of God. It is precious.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.240
The psalmist says, yea, more to be desired are they than

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.400
gold, yea, than much fine gold. The instruction that we've received, the

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.600
written Word of God. I understand that God's not speaking to

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.680
us audibly, but you know it'd be a good idea for us as we sit down and read the

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.120
Word of God to act as if God is speaking these

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.480
words to us, because the Bible says all Scripture is

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.720
given by inspiration. What does the word mean?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.840
God breathed. Amen? And if all Scripture is given by

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.360
inspiration of God, we're thankful that we have the written Word of God that's

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.320
been preserved for us, but our Father, can I tell you, He's

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.880
given us good doctrine. I mean, that's what He says in verse

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.840
number two. He says, for I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.760
Listen, we understand the instruction of the book of Proverbs.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.680
Can I tell you that God has given us good doctrine?

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.320
In the same verse of Scripture in 1 Timothy chapter number four, when the

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.880
Bible says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.000
we find that it tells us that it's profitable for

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
doctrine. Amen? And we understand doctrine's important. You say, but

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.200
doctrine divides. Then so be it. Don't think I'm looking for fights or

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:46.120
anything like that, but I'm just saying, doctrine is important. Amen?

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.920
We cannot, we must not embrace the ideas of some of our liberal brethren that

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.640
have the ecumenical idea that we can set aside doctrine and seek

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.880
to have unity in the things that we agree on. It

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.520
doesn't work. It does not work, brethren. It's not

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.560
possible. What gives us unity is that we support

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:17.960
and embrace the same truth. God is the one that gives us unity

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.960
as we embrace this book. Amen? Notice the message of His lips

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.240
as we've mentioned here in Proverbs 4, but I want you to think about the

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.720
message of His life. We don't necessarily see it here within

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.720
the context of Proverbs 4. We do find that He mentions in

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.880
verses 3 and 4 how that He, Solomon,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.440
received instruction from his father David,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.960
and He says to him in verse 4, He taught me also and said unto me,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.120
let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments, and live.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.800
In fact, if you were to study the life of Solomon prior to

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.720
the situation with all that took place with all of his wives and concubines and

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.520
all of the idolatry that is recorded, you find that He walked with the Lord.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.760
You know, if you look at the first 20 years of the reign of Solomon

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.240
as the King of Israel, and you look at the building of His own

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.040
house, and then the building of the temple, and you see all that's taking

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.120
place, you find in those passages of Scripture,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.320
what did Solomon ask for when the Lord appeared to him? Wisdom.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.520
Give me understanding that I might lead

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.520
your people. I mean, you look at some amazing things and the influence of

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.120
David and his life in his early years, and I'm thankful for that, but I want you

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.000
to notice what Solomon says in Proverbs 23 and verse number 26.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.360
We'll get back to chapter number four here in just a moment, but I want you to

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.040
see what is said here, and it's so

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.240
powerful, and it's so important for us to understand,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.160
and it goes right along with what I mentioned in Deuteronomy chapter number

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.800
six, the instruction that Moses gave to the

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.000
fathers. Listen, you have to know the truth. You have to live the truth,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.080
and then you propagate the truth. You deliver the truth.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.160
If you miss B, you have a hard time with C.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.680
If you're not living the truth, you have a hard time

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.520
teaching the truth. Many times we'll be viewed as being hypocritical.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.840
Amen? Why? Because you're telling me to do something that you aren't

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.080
doing yourself. We find in Proverbs 23 and verse number

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.680
26, the wise man says, my son,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.160
give me thine heart, but notice the rest of the verse,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:40.840
and let thine eyes observe my ways. I wonder how many times I've read

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.560
that verse of Scripture, and I've wondered

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:50.200
this truth I don't need to request of or grant permission to anybody to

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.960
observe my ways. What do I mean by that? My ways are

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.760
being observed anyway. My children in particular, they're

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.040
observing my ways, and it must be that the message of my

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.760
life is in line with the message of my lips.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.880
When I think about this truth spiritually, it causes me to rejoice

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.680
greatly. If I could adopt the words of Brother

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.520
Hummel, he said, I hear, I feel a preaching, a shout coming on, right?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.000
And the reality is that we have the written Word of God,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.280
but we have the living Word of God. John chapter number one, in the beginning

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.600
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.440
Verse number 14, the Word became flesh and dwelt

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:41.480
among us. We have the living Word of God. Jesus Christ said, I am the way, the

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.920
truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.240
Me. Jesus said often during His earthly

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.480
ministry to His disciples in particular, you see it in the

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.760
call of His disciples, He would use these two words,

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.520
follow Me. We find that as He's speaking about being His disciple,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.559
He says that we're to deny ourselves, we're to take up our cross, and we are to

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:09.880
follow Him. Amen? The reality is, I believe

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.640
that one of the reasons in which we struggle so greatly with following the

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.080
Lord Jesus Christ is because we've not first denied ourselves

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.600
and we've not, number two, taken up His cross.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.200
It's going to be a hard thing for me to follow Christ if I'm not denying myself.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.200
Look at what Peter says in 1 Peter. You don't need to turn there, I'll read it

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.120
for you, but in 1 Peter chapter number two,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.720
in verse number 21, the Bible says this. Now think about Peter.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.240
Peter walked with Christ. Amen? He saw the life of the Savior. He saw the

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.320
Messiah. He walked with them. Peter is there at

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.080
the mount of transfiguration. I mean, Peter has experienced amazing things in

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.760
his life as he was an eyewitness. John uses that

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.760
terminology in 1 John chapter number one,

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.640
how that we are eyewitnesses of these things.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.560
And we find that Peter says this in 1st Peter 2 and verse number 21 for even here unto where you called

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.840
Because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.400
That you should follow his steps

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.600
So we have as we think about the responsibility of the father

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.280
Can I tell you that there are times in which as a father I have failed physically speaking

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.800
I have failed to give the proper instruction the words of my lips have not been appropriate perhaps and giving the instruction that I need

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.520
To give the message of my life. Maybe has failed from time to time and if we'd be honest we understand

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.840
We're not perfect

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.880
But can I tell you that God has perfectly fulfilled the responsibility that he laid upon himself to give us

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.480
Good doctrine to give us instruction

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.120
To give us direction for our lives

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:58.040
So often we find that people are searching and they're looking and they want direction and they just want to know what God wants them

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.040
To do get into the book

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.120
The book gives us the truth the book gives us the answers

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.240
Amen

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.400
We're looking in the wrong places sometimes

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.040
We're looking for direction and counsel from the wrong source

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.120
In fact, I'll be dealing with that tonight in our message. Come back. You'll love it. Amen. It'd be great. Praise the Lord

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.680
God's given us good doctrine

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.520
He's given us the written Word of God

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.640
He promised that he'd preserve his word and he has and for that we ought to rejoice

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.760
But he's also given us the living Word

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.000
when God

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Became man. He's the God man. You read Philippians chapter number two, and it just kind of blows your mind

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.560
We understand as we've even studied through the book of Hebrews

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.000
the truth of the incarnation of our Messiah and the fact that he lived a perfect sinless life for those

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.720
Three or so years a little over three years upon this sin curse world and what do you do?

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.080
He left us an example

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:07.240
you read the gospel records and I hope as you read Matthew Mark Luke and John and you begin to read about the life and

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.760
Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and you see how he behaved. Listen, I understand that at times we use these cute little cliches

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.720
What would Jesus do most people that wear a band around their wrist that says?

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.100
WWJD or they have it on the back of their car. They don't know what Jesus would do because they've not read this book

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.160
I'm what I feel like preaching this morning. I

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.680
mean seriously

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.040
How is it that we have been given not only the perfect Word of God?

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.560
But we've been given the example of God in flesh and yet so often we fail to receive the instruction

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.120
To hear the instruction

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.040
See because we see as it's described in chapter number four the book of Proverbs

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.820
It's the instruction of a father. It's good doctrine

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.000
It's in the way of wisdom according to verse number 10

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.840
Notice what he says in verse 10 and 11 in the passage of scripture that we're looking at this morning

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.680
He tells us this truth

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.960
He says here

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.000
Oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of my life shall be many notice verse number 10

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.960
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.840
You know that our God is the all-wise God

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.600
We use the word to describe his wisdom that he is

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.280
Omniscient he's all-knowing

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.680
He said if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God. Why would we ask God because he has all wisdom

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.040
Amen, that's why he doesn't tell us to go ask somebody else

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.440
I'm kind of glad he didn't tell you to go ask the pastor. I

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.840
Don't have all wisdom, but I know the one who does and

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.300
When people do ask me for counsel, I seek and purpose to give counsel that is based upon the truth of this book

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Doesn't matter what my opinion is

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.400
matters what God says

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.160
Notice what he says not only have I led thee in the way of wisdom

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.360
I are taught thee in the way of wisdom, but notice the end of verse number 11

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.160
I have led thee notice what it says in right

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.480
Paths can I tell you this morning that God will never lead you wrong?

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.040
You may lead yourself wrong

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:26.200
You may deceive yourself and you may lead yourself wrong you may justify some things

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.560
But God will never lead you wrong

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.080
Can I tell you this morning that the Holy Spirit of God will never lead you to do something contrary to the written Word of God?

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960
He won't

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.000
God is leading us in right paths

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.160
He's given us the truth and I'm so thankful this morning to find how that yes

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.200
we can look at Solomon and we can look at Rehoboam and we can look at this physical relationship of father and son and we

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.560
Can rejoice in the responsibility that he understood and that he fulfilled

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:04.280
But when I look at it from a spiritual perspective and I understand that I'm a child of God and he's my heavenly father

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.280
And oh, he's a good father

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.920
He's given me good doctrine he has given me truth

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.080
We find the response of children number two

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.600
the responsibility of the father

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.600
The response of children notice again as we look at our passage of scripture in verse number one notice these words

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.880
Here ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding notice again in verse number 10

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.080
Hear oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.360
You know

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.760
The reality is that we will understand as we look at the passage of scripture

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.480
this truth of hearing the purpose in which these words are used throughout the book of Proverbs of

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:55.560
Hearing is not so that you can just gain some level of understanding, but it's so that you would apply the truth in your life

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.920
So often we speak about being doers of the word and not hearers only

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.640
But can I tell you that Jesus said on more than one occasion he that hath an ear let him hear

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.680
We find it in the letters that are written to the churches in

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:16.400
There in Asia in the book of Revelation chapters 2 and 3 he mentions often about hearing

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.960
You're not gonna do it if you've not heard it

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.040
You're not just gonna like accidentally obey God

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.720
We're at enmity with God

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:35.280
We get saved and we get sanctified through the truth of the Word of God and we

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.840
Understand the response of a children of the children listen

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.920
We need to hear the Word of God so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.640
It is good to sit under the sound of the preaching of the Word of God

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.680
I'm glad that you're here this morning. Amen, honestly

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.880
I

00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:00.760
I'm glad that I thank God regularly. I don't fully understand it. In fact, I argued with God about it

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.320
I don't understand why he called me to the ministry. I

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.600
Really don't I don't understand why but I'm thankful he did and I'm thankful that he's enabled me

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.440
But the reality is that we need to hear the Word of God

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.560
We need to hear the truth. We need to hear the instruction of a father and he's given us good instruction

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.800
He's given us the Word of God

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.500
We find that it says in verse number two this for I give you good doctrine notice this response of the children

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.520
Forsake ye not my law

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.080
It's a sad thing when a child of God says yeah, but that doesn't apply to me

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.880
We better be careful forsake ye not my law

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.280
God's given us his word. He's given us good doctrine. Oh

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.480
That was for a different culture you understand the Bible is cross-cultural

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.120
It works in any country of the world

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.840
Why because he's the God of the universe

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.240
Amen and

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.600
We find here that as we continue to think about the response of the children notice in verse number seven

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.040
Wisdom is the principal thing

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.680
therefore

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.680
get wisdom and

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:20.920
With all by getting get understanding what's the picture that you see in verse number seven? There's some work some effort

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.200
To get wisdom to get understanding to you know what Jesus said in John chapter number five

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:34.040
He said let me read it to you because I'm gonna not quote it properly because I wasn't planning to reference this verse of scripture

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.119
But in John 5 in verse number 39, he says search the scriptures why for in them you think

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:47.880
They have eternal life, but then he says this they are they which testify of me

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:51.840
You know what Jesus did in Luke chapter number 24 when he walked with those disciples

00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:59.119
That were going back to Emmaus. He started at Moses and the prophets and he's found expounded all things

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.920
concerning himself

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.840
This morning as we understand this truth of wisdom being the principal thing and the

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:12.239
Wiseman saying therefore

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.600
Listen if wisdom is the principal thing and it is based upon the authority of the Word of God

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.480
therefore get wisdom

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.940
It's not just gonna fall out of the sky and land on your lap

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.080
You know, you got to dig into this book

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.440
There are times in which I read passages of scripture, I don't know how many times I

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.200
Was gonna preach through the book of Hebrews this year and I'm working on it

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.880
I'm working on it, but prior to preaching through the book of Hebrews

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.040
I don't know how many times I read the book of Hebrews over my walk with God

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640
But I know that I purposefully

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.400
read the book of Hebrews

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.760
37 times between October and December in

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.600
preparation of the messages on the book of Hebrews

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.800
Just in its entirety, just starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter 13.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.400
And the next day, starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter number 13.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.000
And then, as I preach and prepare the messages,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
you know how many times I read the passage that I'm going to preach?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.200
I can't number it for you.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.200
Why? I'm trying to get it. I want to understand it.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.800
I want to dig into the Word of God.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.000
There are passages of Scripture...

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.300
Have you ever come across a passage and say, I'm not sure what that means?

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.500
Come on, if you haven't, I need to talk to you.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.700
And maybe you need to come up here and preach.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.200
But there are times in which you come to a passage of Scripture and say,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.800
God, I don't know what you mean.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.900
I don't know what you're trying to tell me.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.300
I don't understand the truth that you're trying to reveal.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.200
And you wrestle with it, and you work, and you work, and you work.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.100
And the Holy Spirit of God, who's our Teacher, He reveals truth to us.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.000
The Bible's awesome.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.300
But we've got to work. We've got to work.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.600
The Bible tells us to study to show thyself approved unto God.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.700
A workman, amen, that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.700
And we understand, listen, it's work.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.700
I had the privilege of visiting with someone this week,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.900
and as I went to visit with them,

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:22.200
I noticed that there was some information there with regard to some memorization cards.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.100
I thought, man, that's great. Working on memorizing the Word of God.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.000
Began to have conversation about that particular thing that I saw.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.200
And as we're talking about it, I said, you know, I get asked all the time,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.200
how can you memorize Scripture?

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.500
And my consistent answer is W-O-R-K.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.800
It takes work to memorize the Word of God.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.900
It really does.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:52.100
And the older you get, or the more you try to memorize, the more work it takes.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.300
Just takes work.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:01.900
Sometimes we forget that, but he says, get wisdom, get understanding, labor for it, work for it.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.300
Notice what he says back in Proverbs 4, in verse number 13,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.600
take fast hold of instruction.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.000
I mean, does your mind, when you read these words,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.300
does it not give you some pictures, some images of what we're to do?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.300
Take fast hold of this instruction.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.900
He says this, notice, let her not go.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.100
Can I tell you that if you found truth in the Word of God,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.800
you better not let it go for anything.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.000
I don't care who comes down the road.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.200
I don't care what they try to teach.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.300
If you have the truth of the Word of God, you better hold on to it.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.300
Don't compromise on it.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.900
Don't change.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.400
No, no, let's search the Scriptures, let's understand what the Word of God says.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.100
And we find, he says, take fast hold here of instruction.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.700
Let her not go.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.500
Keep her, for she is thy life.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.200
In Proverbs 13, in verse number 1, the Bible says,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.900
a wise son heareth his father's instruction.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.700
But I want you to think about that truth and couple it with chapter 28, in verse number 7,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.500
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.200
So now listen, if you look at Proverbs 13, in verse number 1,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.700
it says a wise son heareth his father's instruction.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.700
So we get some information about a wise son.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.400
What does he do? He hears the instruction.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.500
But we understand some more information about a wise son in Proverbs 28, in verse number 7,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.300
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.100
So it's not just hearing, it's keeping, it's doing.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.300
We think about the application for us this morning.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.400
We see the truth that God's given us good doctrine.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.700
He's given us the written Word of God. He's given us the living Word of God.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.600
And how is it that we respond?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.000
Are we hearing the instruction?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.900
Are we understanding that this book is profitable?

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.100
That I need the content of this book every day of my life?

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.500
I don't just need the Bible when I have a problem.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:15.500
In fact, if we get a regular routine of getting into the Word of God,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.000
then maybe when the problem comes, we already have the answer.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.300
Why? Because God's been preparing me. God's been feeding me. He's sustaining me.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.000
And that problem comes, we say, man, God, I'm so thankful

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
that You gave me that truth that I read just a few days ago.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.600
You knew that I needed that, because You knew what was coming in my life.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.700
That's how God works. Now, sometimes He lets something come

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.800
that we didn't have that preparation for.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.700
And we search the book. We get into the Word of God.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.800
God, help me. Give me wisdom.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.800
Notice the result. We see the responsibility of the Father,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.700
the response of the children. Notice the result. I love it.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:02.000
The Bible tells us several things within the passage in Proverbs 4.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.800
In verse 6, notice first of all it says this,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.000
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Love her, and she shall keep thee.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.800
Wisdom is in reference here as we look at the portion of Scripture.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.700
And we notice, wisdom shall preserve thee.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.000
You know that God's instruction as we hear it and as we obey it,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
that it protects and guards us from troubles and evils?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.800
It does. God's designed it that way.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.000
Listen, as a father, humanly speaking,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.500
are there some things that you instructed your children with

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.500
so that it would keep them, protect them, preserve them

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.200
from some troubles and evils?

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.800
Sure. Why did you tell them not to play in the middle of the road?

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.800
Because it's dangerous.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800
I was chatting with somebody just yesterday,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.000
and I was talking to them about the dangers of outlets

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.600
and how almost every child I've ever witnessed

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.800
somehow or another has a magnet for a wall outlet.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.800
It's amazing.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.400
It's like it's just calling their name.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.200
Somebody's made a lot of money on that

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.200
by getting all those covers and all those things,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.000
and then you get the covers that are child-proof

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.800
and you can't get the crazy things out to be able to use the outlet.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.400
Amen, Joseph?

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.400
He said to me the other day,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.200
how do you get this crazy thing out of here anyway?

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.600
It's kid-proof. No, just kidding.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.400
The reality is that when I said that to the individual,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.800
they said, man, I'm going to protect all of my outlets

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.200
because I don't want my kid putting something in there.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200
Yeah, why?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.200
Because you're trying to protect them.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.600
And when you tell Johnny or Susie, don't put it in there,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.400
you're trying to keep them, to preserve them.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.200
So guess what?

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.000
When God gives us the instruction that He's given us,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.600
when we hear it and when we follow it,

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.000
can I tell you that one of the results that we see here in Proverbs 4

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.400
is that it will protect and guard us from any troubles and evils?

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.600
The reality is that it shall preserve thee.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.400
There are some things that we just understand biblically

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.200
that we take and make decisions based on.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.600
There are some things I'm not going to do,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.600
some places I'm not going to go, so on and so forth.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.600
Why? Because there's biblical command and it's preserved me.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.800
It has. Amen?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.400
If you'd be honest, I hope that you could say it's preserved you.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.200
Because that's what the Word of God says.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.000
If you hear it and you keep it, it shall preserve thee.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.800
It's going to keep us, it's going to protect us and guard us.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.000
Number two, what is the result that we see?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.600
In verse 8 and 9, notice it says,

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.600
Exalt her and she shall promote thee.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.000
She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.400
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.800
a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.800
I see here in verses 8 and 9 that wisdom shall promote thee.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.000
And really in my mind's eye, I see the truth of blessings.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
You know what, and we're going to look at the passage,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.600
Lord willing we'll have time.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.200
In Deuteronomy, actually we won't look in there,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.000
we'll skip that, I don't have time.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
But in Deuteronomy 11, let me just give you what it says.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
This day what I do, I lay before you a blessing and a curse.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.400
Right? Is that what the Bible says?

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.000
Those of you that are familiar with Deuteronomy 11,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.600
it's what it says.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.000
A blessing if you obey.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.200
A curse if you disobey.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.800
I mean, it's pretty straightforward, right?

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800
And so guess what?

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:39.800
God has attached in His Word blessings to obedience.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.600
It's just the truth.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.200
Why is it that we have the blessing,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.600
the certainty of heaven?

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.600
Because we obeyed the Gospel.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.800
Amen?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.000
We heard the Gospel, we believed it,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.600
we accept that Christ is our Savior.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.600
Because Jesus Christ died on the cross for us,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.400
He was buried, He rose in victory,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.000
and we understood that truth and it was delivered to us,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.600
and we obeyed the truth of the Word of God.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.600
We obeyed the Gospel.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.800
But throughout our lives, we think about when we exalt wisdom,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.400
when we are hearing and doing and following the instruction

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.600
or understanding that God has given us the written Word of God,

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.400
He's given us the living Word of God,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.800
that the blessings are going to come.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.600
This evening when we deal with the subject matter

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600
in which we're going to deal with,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600
we'll see it particularly in the passage

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.200
that we'll be dealing with tonight.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.600
Number three, notice in verse 10,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.800
"'Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.600
and the years of thy life shall be many.'"

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.600
The Bible says the way of the transgressor is hard.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.400
We find that as we look at this,

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.200
and we understand the longevity, length of, and quality of life.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.800
You know, I'm so thankful for the truth of eternal life.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800
I really am.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.800
I am so thankful for the promise that the Bible says.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.680
The Bible tells us that the gift of God is eternal life

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.360
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.260
John 6 and verse 23, what a blessing.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.680
But can I tell you that in John 10 and verse number 10,

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.200
he tells us that he came to give us life

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.080
and that we might have it more abundant.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.120
You know, he's given us the truth of the word of God

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.640
that we can have not only length of days,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.020
but we can have quality of days, abundant life.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.640
I'm thankful that we have everlasting life

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.600
and the truth of God's gift of salvation,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.880
but we have that abundant life, that quality of life.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.260
Not only do we see these three items,

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.600
notice in verse number 12,

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.640
as we think about a fourth result,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.560
the Bible tells us when thou goest,

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.240
now understood contextually,

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.320
you're going in the way that I've guided you.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.360
You're going with the truth that I've given you.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.780
You've heard the instruction.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.440
You've received the instruction.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.960
You're doing the word of God.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.560
You're obeying the truth that I've given you.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.600
Then when you go, thy step shall not be straightened,

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.120
and when thou runnest, thou shall not stumble.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.680
The idea there of thy step shall not be straightened

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.240
has the idea of being impeded.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.360
And we understand that it says

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.680
that when thou runnest, thou shall not stumble.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.760
I'm thankful that the truth of God's word

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.760
will prevent us from dealing

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.000
with some of the pitfalls of life.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.040
Some of the obstacles and hardships

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.600
that life can bring our way,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.040
we can avoid those things.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.680
We can be delivered,

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.040
preventing us from having to endorse

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:40.880
some of those things.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.760
Why? Because we've taken heed to the instruction.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.080
Now, I'm not saying to you this morning

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.640
that you'll avoid every trouble,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.440
because we understand that there are times

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.000
in which actively obeying God's instruction

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.480
leads you directly into a storm.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.440
You say, pastor, you're crazy.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.160
No, just look at the disciples.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.160
It was God in flesh, Jesus Christ,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.600
that said get in a boat and go over the Sea of Galilee,

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.120
and they got in the boat, and they got in,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.240
and they had a storm.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.960
They were obedient.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.000
They weren't disobedient.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.360
I mentioned on Wednesday evening

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.600
as we spoke about the when we shall see Christ,

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600
another title of the song,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.880
when we see Christ, when we see Jesus.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.840
Man, what a blessing.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.680
I love the song.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.600
I think Ms. Joyce, she's asked me a couple of times,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.800
at my funeral, I want that song.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.960
Amen?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.800
Why?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.320
Because she understands

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.080
that when she takes her final breath here,

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.720
that she'll be immediately in heaven with her Savior,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.960
and she'll see Him face to face, and what a blessing.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.280
But the song talks about

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.240
when all of life's trials are passed.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.720
And I mentioned this on Wednesday evening.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.560
Those of you that were here,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.240
some that were watching via live stream,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.840
I made the statement that the troubles and trials,

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.680
the storms of life,

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.800
I'm so thankful that one day they will soon be over.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.080
They will all be over.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.280
And what a blessing.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.040
But can I tell you that sometimes

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.440
we must come to this understanding

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.960
that in the midst of the storms,

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.400
God has a purpose,

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.960
that He would be glorified,

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.000
that we would be developed

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.240
in the very midst of the storms.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.080
God's in control.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.600
Do we believe that God's in control?

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.400
If He is,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.400
if we are following His instruction,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.400
if we're doing what He's told us to do,

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.720
if we're being good receivers of instruction,

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.160
if we're responding properly,

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.440
then He's going to give us that guidance

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.840
and direction that we need.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.640
And we see these results

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.360
and what blessed results they are.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.680
Oftentimes when we look at the results,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.080
whether contextually

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.760
in what we're dealing with this morning,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.080
or maybe some other area of life,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.080
we say, yep, I want those results.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.640
We know what the problem is?

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.400
We don't want the process.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.240
We're an instant society.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.520
Amen?

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.280
But to get the results,

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.360
we must follow the process.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.840
We must hear and receive.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.560
We must respond properly.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.720
The truth of the matter

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.560
is that this book sitting on a shelf

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.720
somewhere all week and collecting dust,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.600
though it is the most important,

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.040
most profitable book in all of the world,

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.400
it's doing you nothing.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.160
Because you're not reading it.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.000
You're not following it.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.440
You're not obeying it.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.080
I think, I don't remember who it was,

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.480
I think it might have been Charles Ryrie.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.360
It might have been somebody else,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.080
so don't fact check me on it

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.360
because I'm telling you up front,

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.520
I can't remember exactly who it was that said it.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.160
But he said this,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.360
on one page of Scripture,

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.640
I have more life transforming truth

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.000
than in all of the volumes

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.320
of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.960
I thought, man, I like his perspective.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.440
I do.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.560
Now, you young people,

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.680
I know you don't have volumes

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.960
of Encyclopedia Britannica

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.520
because we have Wikipedia

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.240
and they stopped actually printing it

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.560
a number of years ago,

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.360
but the reality is that God's Word

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.120
is full of good instruction, good doctrine,

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.840
and oh, that we just hear it and receive it.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.600
Let me close with two passages of Scripture,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.480
Psalm 19.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.200
We're familiar with Psalm 19.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:13.960
The Bible begins with,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.440
the heavens declare the glory of God,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.760
the firmament showeth forth His handiwork.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.120
What a blessing.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.560
Think about the beauty of creation,

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.360
how it reveals there's a Creator.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.480
As we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.720
it quickly moves from the truth of creation

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.440
to the truth of God's written Word.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.680
Of course, as we think about this passage

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.520
being the Old Testament,

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.720
the law of the Lord, the books of Moses,

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.560
we find that the Bible begins in verse number seven.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.360
It says, the law of the Lord is perfect,

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.720
converting the soul.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.960
The testimony of the Lord is sure,

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.200
making wise the simple.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.600
The statutes of the Lord are right,

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.160
rejoicing the heart.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.440
The commandment of the Lord is pure,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.360
enlightening the eyes.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.520
The fear of the Lord is clean,

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.200
enduring forever.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.560
The judgments of the Lord are true

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.640
and righteous altogether.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.360
More to be desired they than gold,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.320
yea, than much fine gold.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.080
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.680
Moreover, don't miss verse number 11,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.280
moreover, by them.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.120
What is them?

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.600
What's he been referring to the whole time?

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.360
The law of the Lord.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.840
By them, by the truth of the Word of God,

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.320
is thy servant warned.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.520
You hear, unfortunately, a generation today,

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.040
I just don't like church and the Bible

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.200
because it's got all those thou shalt nots.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.360
I'm thankful God gave us a bunch of thou shalt nots.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.440
You know why?

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.880
It's preserved me.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.900
It's prevented me from dealing with some hardships.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.960
Why?

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.320
Because God said thou shalt not.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.920
God, I understand that in your wisdom

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.000
you told me not to do this,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.440
and by your grace and with your help,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.640
I'm not gonna do it.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.920
Notice, by them is thy servant warned,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.600
and in keeping of them,

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.120
there is great reward.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.240
The keeping of them.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.200
See, we're warned, but then we keep it.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.240
Notice Deuteronomy chapter 30.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.800
I preached short last week,

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.840
and I'm gonna preach longer today.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.520
I'm not, I'm just teasing.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.080
I didn't really preach short last week.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.840
In fact, Joseph was doing the sound last week,

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.520
and he was rooting for me to go another minute longer

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.580
because I preached 58 and a half minutes.

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.140
I never preach that long.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.240
But Hebrews chapter number seven

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.560
was just such a technical passage of scripture,

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.920
and I didn't wanna break it up,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.120
and so I almost got to a full hour,

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.000
and he was cheering for just a little bit more, Daddy.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.400
And so thank Joseph, amen?

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.420
He's not doing sound today,

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.340
but Deuteronomy chapter 30,

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.500
notice in verse number 10,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.300
and I'll finish with this passage.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.860
Notice the first word, if.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.460
Deuteronomy 30 and verse number 10.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.780
If.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.560
It's an important word.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.100
Just two letters in our English language,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.660
but oh, what a message they carry.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.660
If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.920
To keep his commandments and his statutes,

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.620
which are written in this book of the law.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.440
And if, we see it again,

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.100
thou turn unto the Lord thy God

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.180
with all thine heart, with all thy soul.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.980
For this commandment, which I command thee this day,

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.140
notice this, it is not hidden from thee,

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.980
neither is it far off.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.180
Aren't you thankful that we have the word of God?

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.400
We have it.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.300
I'm not saying this to pat myself on the back,

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.140
but you ought to be thankful

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.720
that you got a church and a pastor

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.660
that preaches the word of God.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.940
Because the reality is that you can go long and far

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.780
around this nation

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.040
and you can find a dearth of good Bible preaching.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.260
I'm just saying, preach the Bible.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.820
Notice verse number 12.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.860
It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say,

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.640
who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us,

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.820
that we may hear it and do it.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.220
Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say,

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.580
who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us,

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.040
that we may hear it and do it.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.280
No, the reality is that if you want to hear it and do it,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.620
it's available.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.840
Some people say, if I just knew what to do.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.280
Like all of the flashing lights and everything,

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.280
like if you just knew what to do, here you go.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.000
Amen?

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:28.820
Notice verse 14, but the word is very nigh unto thee,

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.240
in thy mouth and thy heart thou shouldest,

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.620
that thou mayest do it.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.260
See, I have set before thee this day,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.060
life and good and death and evil.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.780
In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.620
to walk in his ways, to keep his commandments

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.900
and his statutes and his judgments,

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.580
that thou mayest live and multiply.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.900
And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.540
whither thou goest to possess it.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.460
But look, we see that word again, if.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:57.420
But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear,

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.580
but shall be drawn away and worship other gods

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.420
and serve them,

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.260
I deny.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.980
unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.480
and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land,

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.100
whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.980
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you,

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.940
that I have set before you life and death, blessing

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.860
and cursing.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:25.700
Therefore, choose life, that both thou and thy seed

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.540
may live, that thou mayest love the Lord thy God,

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.300
and that thou mayest obey His voice,

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:34.460
and that thou mayest cleave unto Him, for He is thy life,

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.540
the length of thy days, that thou mayest dwell in the land

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.340
which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.980
and to Jacob, to give them."

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.780
The sad reality is that even as we've

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.060
studied through the book of Joshua,

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:52.780
we're in the midst of the land being divided

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.580
and the inheritance for each of the tribes,

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.980
and so on and so forth.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.940
And we think about the passage of Scripture,

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.620
we think about the truth of the fullness of the book of Joshua,

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.100
they go into the land.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.740
God brings them in.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.780
God gave them warnings.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.940
Joshua gives messages, the warnings

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.060
that are contained therein.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.340
You know what the sad reality is?

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.780
They were judged because of their disobedience.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.540
They didn't always stay in their land.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.000
The promise of a remnant that returned after the Babylonian

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.180
captivity, I thank God that it happened.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.920
But you understand, the Assyrians came in,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.160
and a little while later, the Babylonians come in.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.920
Why?

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.960
It wasn't because God wasn't able to preserve His people.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.520
It was because His people forsook

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.040
the instruction He gave them.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.520
They served idols.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.560
They did all sorts of wickedness,

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.560
and the judgment of God came.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.400
And they were warned of that.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.440
And this morning, as we think about the instruction

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.440
of a father, I'm thankful for the instruction

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.560
that I received from my earthly father.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.840
I'm thankful for the opportunity and the responsibility

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.720
that I have to give instruction to my children,

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.600
physically, humanly speaking.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.600
I wish I could say I always responded properly

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.100
to the instruction I received from my father, but he's here,

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.320
and I'm not interested in lying.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.680
I didn't always receive it properly.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.720
And if you did, never mind.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.280
Let me say this.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.520
Biblically speaking, our God has given us

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.960
the written word of God.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.640
He's given us good instruction, the instruction of a father,

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.400
our heavenly father.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.520
It's good doctrine.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.720
He said, how are you going to respond to it?

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.680
I said this in the beginning of the message this morning,

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.480
and I'm going to close with this thought.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.640
Our lives, as God's people, as God's children,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.920
our lives should be characterized by obedience

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.200
to the word of God.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.040
Should be characterized by obedience to the word of God.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.360
That we are doers of the word, not hearers only.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.760
That we're digging into the book.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.640
You know, I see statistics all the time.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.160
I get periodicals and magazines.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.320
I don't read half of them.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.640
I don't have time.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.120
Why?

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.160
Because I'd rather read the Bible than all that stuff,

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.160
and so I'm not going to change my Bible reading

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.400
time to read all of that.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.640
But I do get a bunch of things, and I do read many of those.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.200
And when you start reading the statistics of people

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.640
that claim to be Bible-believing regular attenders of church

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.520
that are asked the question, have you ever

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.920
read the Bible completely cover to cover,

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.120
and you see that a large percentage of them

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.660
say no, it's a problem.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.360
And then when you say to the people that

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.820
say they do read it cover to cover,

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.440
and you say, OK, how many days a week do you read the Bible?

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.600
Do you have a plan?

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.240
Do you have an overwhelming majority of people

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.280
have no plan?

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.840
Now, I will readily admit I've never

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.300
been called by any of those people,

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.480
and I've never participated in the surveys.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.520
And I understand statistics and the way they work

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.860
and how you can make them say what you want them to say,

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.160
but I would say there's a problem.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.400
If that is any representation of reality,

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.840
and I'm sad to say that I'm sure it is,

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.040
then what God has given us as good instruction,

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.640
unfortunately, His people have said, I'm OK.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.920
I'm going to figure this out myself.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.640
It's not really for me.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.360
And then we wander around, and we flounder around.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.560
We deal with problems and troubles and difficulties,

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.880
and we wonder why.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.080
God's given us His word.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.200
Oh, that we would hear it and receive it,

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.960
and that we would get it, that we'd labor for it,

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:49.960
that we would hold onto it, lay hold of it, let it not go,

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.320
forsake it not, but be doers of the word.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.040
The instruction of a father.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.120
Humanly speaking, I'm thankful that Solomon

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.920
gave some instruction of Rehoboam.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.720
Spiritually speaking, I'm thankful

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.320
that our Heavenly Father has given us a perfect book.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.720
It's changed my life.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.080
It's helped me in so many ways.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.600
And I'm sure that you could stand and testify

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.280
of how the book has helped you as well.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:13.800
Let's pray.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.320
Father, we love you.

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.080
We thank you for loving us.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.000
Thank you for this day, Father's Day,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.760
that we can think about the responsibility,

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.640
humanly speaking, of instructing the children

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.880
that you would bless us with.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.240
And Lord, what a blessing.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.120
We're so thankful for that charge that we can receive.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.000
Thankful for the truth with regard to the children,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.040
how they respond to it.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.640
Thank you for the results that you carry forth and show us

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.120
in your Word.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.000
In a much greater, far more important aspect,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.320
we understand that the book of Proverbs records for us

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.080
the instruction of our Heavenly Father

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.160
to us as your children.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.320
And God, as we examine the truth of this passage of Scripture,

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.000
I pray that you'd help us to examine it

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.520
from that perspective.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.840
This is God my Savior, my Father.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:12.000
I'm His son, His child, and He's given me this instruction.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.440
Oh God, would you help us to have

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.040
our lives characterized by obedience to Thy Word?

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.560
We take the simplicity of that truth in John 2.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.440
Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.200
God, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.480
Help us, Lord, to understand the treasure that you've

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.440
given us in your Word.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.720
Just how powerful and profitable it is,

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.520
how it gives us the answers for all of life's questions.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.320
Lord, help us to roll up our sleeves and labor, work,

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:51.280
dig in to get the wisdom that you have for us.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.780
I pray that this morning, if there's

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.440
one that's not sure of heaven, whether they're here locally

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.840
or they're tuned in via the live stream,

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.680
I pray they'd understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, God

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.040
in flesh, died for them, was buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.200
and rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.160
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.920
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.360
The Holy Spirit of God would convict you

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.760
of sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.680
to come.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.440
Maybe this morning there's one that says,

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.360
I've never been saved.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.600
I don't know.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.000
The Lord is my Savior.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.720
Would you trust Him today?

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.720
Today is the day of salvation.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.040
Understand there's nothing good that you can do.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:40.840
It's all in what Jesus did.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.520
Lord, I pray that you'd work in that individual's heart.

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.160
We think about those that are here, Lord, that are saved.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.520
We're your children.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.320
Those that are logged on watching

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.520
that are your children, God, would you

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:56.160
help us to receive the instruction,

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.800
obey the instruction?

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.240
Help us, Lord, to recognize what we

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.680
have in the written word of God, in the living word of God,

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.240
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.200
There would not be just some cliche

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.160
that we throw around of what would Jesus do,

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.000
but that through studying thy written word

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.200
and studying the life of Christ through the Gospels,

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.840
that we would have an understanding of how He

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:22.640
behaved, what He did, that we might follow His example.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.200
Help us, Lord.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.480
Work in and through our lives.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.640
We'll thank you for the decisions that will be made,

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.880
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.680
Would you stand with me?

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.760
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.800
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.300
Maybe you want to pray in your seat.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.960
Maybe you want to pray in your chair.
