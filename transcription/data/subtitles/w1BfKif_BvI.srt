1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
And we're going to continue our thought that we've had here for about seven weeks on Wednesday

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
evening.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,359
This is lesson number seven with regard to doing what we ought to do.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,360
And the series, James chapter four will be this evening, but this series has been designed

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,600
to help us do the things we ought to do.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,079
In other words, it's designed to affect our behavior, to influence how we behave.

7
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:34,200
That our behavior would be such that we would be doing the things that God has commanded

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,540
or instructed us to do.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,759
Each lesson really leads us to a time of honest evaluation in our lives where we determine

10
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,680
based on what God has specifically told us in his word that we ought to do this.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,959
Then I honestly and humbly examine my life, encourage you to examine your life to determine

12
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,080
are we doing what we ought to be doing?

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,879
The principles that are given to us need to be taken heed to.

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,839
We need to take and pay attention to apply the truth in our lives, making necessary adjustments.

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:17,360
You think about life and there are times in which we got to make adjustments along the

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
way.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,199
We were flying home late Monday night, early into Tuesday morning and as we were flying

18
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:27,480
over Cuba, there was a great storm to the east of where we were flying and the pilot

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,120
had to continue to make adjustments to his flight plan.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
How did I know that?

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,180
Well, I had a window seat and I could see the lightning out to the east, number one.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,480
Number two, I could feel the plane changing routes and then number three, I had this thing

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,360
right in front of me that had the flight pattern and we got to Cuba and we made this big kind

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,919
of U and then we continued going north.

25
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:53,879
And he had to make adjustments on the go, why?

26
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,559
Because it really is not good to fly through a storm with lightning and so on and so forth.

27
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:03,120
It can really not only do some structural damage, but obviously have a great impact

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,160
on your instrument panels and all the electrical components within an aircraft.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,059
And so there were adjustments that needed to be made.

30
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:15,360
We understand that as we live life, there are times in which there need to be adjustments

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,800
in our lives.

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,199
We get going along in life and we're going on our path and we don't even maybe acknowledge

33
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,820
that we are going in a direction or doing something that might not be exactly what we

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,679
ought to be doing and then we hear the teaching and the preaching of God's word.

35
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:36,800
We read our Bibles and our daily devotions and we see that God says, we ought to be doing

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,940
this and we evaluate and then we make adjustments.

37
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,919
What does that really summed up to be?

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,160
Well, that's being a doer of the word and not a hearer only.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,600
We find that James begins in chapter number one, talking about that very thing that we

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,240
so often quote, that we ought to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,399
Unfortunately, there are many times in Jesus likened this thought that there are many times

42
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,960
in life that people hear, but they don't make the adjustments.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,520
They don't apply, they don't do.

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,600
And Jesus said that individual that hears, but does not apply, well, they're foolish.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
And he likens them to a foolish man.

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,039
I think that it's silly for us, for an individual to be told what we ought to do.

47
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:32,000
To be told in God's holy, inspired, preserved word that here's what you ought to do and

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,080
for us to be like, yeah, but I don't want to.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,320
This doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, but you know there are a lot of people that

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,399
live that way.

51
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:44,080
They hear, they don't do any evaluating and they do no adjusting.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,600
They just continue on carrying on just as they always have and just keep on that trajectory.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,679
This evening as we look at this portion of scripture, it's our seventh lesson.

54
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:00,679
The first week we talked about men ought always to pray.

55
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:05,919
We talked about the fact that men, excuse me, that we ought to obey God rather than

56
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,919
men.

57
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,279
That we ought to grow spiritually.

58
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,199
What are we doing to grow spiritually?

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,119
Are we purposefully doing something in our lives that we would grow spiritually?

60
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:20,839
That we're challenging ourselves with regard to our Bible reading, our prayer time, our

61
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:27,559
Bible memorization, that we're growing closer to God, that we're increasing in our knowledge

62
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,559
of God.

63
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,959
To know God is to know His word.

64
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,559
And how we need to increase in our knowledge of God to grow spiritually.

65
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:38,480
We ought to walk humbly and to walk in humility.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,559
God says that He resisted the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.

67
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:47,320
And we said this, we ought to proclaim the gospel.

68
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,640
And this week, this past week, we had the opportunity to participate, as I mentioned,

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,640
five different special or designated times on their calendar while we were there to go

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,839
out on some level of outreach throughout the week.

71
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,839
And it was a real blessing.

72
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:10,079
There was a purposed, a clear purpose of their church making an emphasis on outreach.

73
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,160
You saw a passion from their folks.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,359
They were passionate about proclaiming the gospel, about sharing the truth of God's love

75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,600
with those that they would come into contact with.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Not last Wednesday, but the week before, I taught on this, that we ought to love one

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
another.

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,880
We ought to love one another.

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,760
So we find this evening as we come to this familiar passage of scripture, the Bible tells

80
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,799
us in James 4, verses 13 through 15 will be our text for this evening.

81
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:43,040
Notice the Bible says, go to now ye that say, today or tomorrow, we will go into such a

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,239
city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain.

83
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:51,359
Verse 14, whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow, for what is your life?

84
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:56,200
There's even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away, for that

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:03,040
ye ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,720
I titled the message this evening, we ought to seek the Lord.

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,880
We ought to seek the Lord.

88
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,440
We find that in life we understand that there are decisions that we have to make and there

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,119
are times in which those decisions face us and we might look at those decisions as this

90
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,279
is a big decision, I need to seek the Lord.

91
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:26,959
I need to know the will of the Lord with regard to this decision.

92
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,760
Can I say to you this evening, we need to seek the Lord for direction in every area

93
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,000
of our life and every decision that we make.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,839
It's not just the big decisions that all of a sudden I need God's input on and I need

95
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,959
God's will and God's direction, no, I need God's direction at every turn, at every step

96
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,239
of my life and so do you.

97
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:55,200
We find in the text of Scripture, again, a familiar passage of Scripture, as we think

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,920
about this thought, we ought, he says in verse 15, for ye ought to say, if the Lord will,

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,799
we shall live and do this or that.

100
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,760
And so kind of dealing with this thought that we ought to seek the Lord, why?

101
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,239
So that we would know the will of the Lord.

102
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:13,559
You know, sometimes we talk about the will of the Lord and you'll hear that phraseology

103
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:18,160
and people will have this idea, well how can I know God's will as it's some mystical thing

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,440
that God is trying to hide from us.

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,040
Let me say this by way of introduction, to know the will of God, we find that God has

106
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,359
given us in his word many revealed truths that are his will.

107
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:39,239
In fact, you find some verses of Scripture that specifically say this is the will of

108
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,440
God.

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,119
And so if it can't be any more plain than that, I'm not sure what else it would say.

110
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:54,399
And so we find that going into the truth of God's word reveals to us the will of God for

111
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,100
the people of God.

112
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,920
Sometimes we talk about, well what's God's will for me individually, personally, what

113
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,559
does God want me to do?

114
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:09,399
And we see that there's the revealed will of God that is the, broadly speaking, the

115
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,679
will of God for all people of God, all the children of God.

116
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:17,480
And I would say this, that we cannot ignore the will of God that has been plainly given

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,000
to us as we say, well I want to know what God wants me to do here.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,320
Hey, start doing the will of God that is already revealed and he will continue to reveal more

119
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,519
to you.

120
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,520
Paul and Barnabas were already serving in the church at Antioch when God revealed his

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,719
will for them to go on the missionary journey.

122
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,080
They were already doing what God had revealed to them and as they're doing it, God reveals

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,599
more specifically of what they're to do.

124
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,719
We find that they're desiring to go and to preach the gospel on a subsequent missionary

125
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,719
journey.

126
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,719
Are we going to go here?

127
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,719
Are we going to go there?

128
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:58,000
God shuts the door, God shuts the door, and then God gives clear direction, here's where

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,719
I want you to go.

130
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:02,400
And we find that we seek the will of the Lord.

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,280
We seek the Lord to know his will.

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,440
In verse number 13, if you're going to take notes this evening, I would say this, I notice

133
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,239
in verse number 13 the first thought, the routine of life.

134
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,239
The routine of life.

135
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,919
Do you ever get stuck in a rut?

136
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,520
Do you ever get stuck in the routine?

137
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Just the monotony of life, if you will, just the routine that we have and I understand

138
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,520
sometimes when we speak about routine, we speak about it in a positive sense and this

139
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,059
evening I understand that there are some aspects of routine that are positive and it's necessary

140
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,419
and we want to have structure and so on and so forth, but when I begin to think about

141
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,859
verse number 13 and I think about the routine here, really what's happening is these individuals,

142
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:50,539
these are believers that are being written to, that they're making plans, making decisions,

143
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:56,659
going through life, the routine of life, without any consideration whatsoever as to what God's

144
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,380
will is.

145
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,020
Their consideration is really just...

146
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,460
just how it could benefit them,

147
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,440
what they might be able to gain,

148
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
how they might be able to,

149
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,440
and they're just not even for a moment,

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
as you look at the text of scripture,

151
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,720
it seems as if they're not even considering

152
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,000
what the will of the Lord might be

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
in seeking the face of God.

154
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,480
Notice in verse 13,

155
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
go to now ye that say,

156
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,680
here's what they're saying,

157
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,580
today or tomorrow,

158
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,360
we will go into such a city.

159
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
So they're saying,

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
here's what we're gonna do,

161
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,280
here are our plans,

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
we're gonna go to a city,

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
whether we go today or tomorrow,

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,120
we're gonna make this decision,

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,480
we're gonna go to a city,

166
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,800
and then notice this phrase

167
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,120
right in the middle of the verse,

168
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,160
and continue there a year,

169
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,860
continue there a year.

170
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,460
What are they gonna do while they're there?

171
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,180
Well, it says buy and sell,

172
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,920
and get gain,

173
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
and get gain.

174
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,680
And so they thought this was a decision

175
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,320
that's based upon the economic possibility

176
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,000
that I can go to this place,

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,880
I can travel there with the goods,

178
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,560
the business savvy that I have,

179
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,060
the goods that I'm able to produce,

180
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,440
whatever it might be with regard

181
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,160
to the timing of the writing,

182
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
and we think about it in our own lives,

183
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,360
obviously, we live in a different time and culture

184
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,960
than what they had here in the book of James.

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
But they're saying,

186
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
we're gonna go there,

187
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
we're gonna continue there for a year,

188
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,520
and we're gonna buy and sell,

189
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,880
and we're gonna benefit from this,

190
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,480
we're gonna get gain.

191
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,200
And they're making these plans,

192
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,040
they're going through the routine of life, if you will,

193
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
and this is something that perhaps

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,660
they had done many, many other times,

195
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,680
this is something that they were used to.

196
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,400
I don't know when it was that these individuals

197
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,440
trusted Christ as their savior,

198
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't know if they had already been in business

199
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,500
for years beforehand,

200
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,420
or what the exact circumstances are,

201
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,160
but I know that the Bible allows us

202
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,340
to take a principle and then make the application.

203
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,580
To take a principle and then make application.

204
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,380
And the reality is that there are times

205
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,140
in which people trust Christ as their savior,

206
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,040
and they think that they're gonna continue to live

207
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,620
by the same rules that they used to live by,

208
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
and following the same decision-making process

209
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,380
that they used to live by,

210
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,580
but understand that if any man is in Christ,

211
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,960
if they're a new creature,

212
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,180
old things are passed away,

213
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,380
behold, all things are become new.

214
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,940
With the way that I made decisions before I got saved

215
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,180
should be different than the way I make decisions

216
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,580
after I got saved.

217
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,780
And we find that this evening,

218
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,620
though it may be true that they could travel

219
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,900
to this particular city,

220
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,360
that they could go to this place,

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,380
that they could buy and sell,

222
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,340
and they could gain,

223
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,900
the reality is that it seems as if

224
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,500
the text of scripture is addressing these individuals

225
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,620
because they're not having God

226
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,100
as part of the decision-making process.

227
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,860
They've not sought the will of the Lord.

228
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,100
I know there are times in which I've said to people

229
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,920
over the years,

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,940
they'll tell me of a decision that they've made,

231
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,180
and I'll say something like this,

232
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,980
did you seek the will of God on this?

233
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,180
Did you seek the face of God?

234
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,720
Did you pray about this?

235
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,660
And I remember one time,

236
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,300
and it was years and years ago,

237
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,360
and probably 12 and a half,

238
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,620
it was just within six months or so of us being here,

239
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,200
12 and a half, maybe more years ago,

240
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,520
and someone said they were gonna go find another church,

241
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,840
and I said, that's great.

242
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I said, did you pray about that?

243
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,380
And they said, that's what they said.

244
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,760
They said, silence.

245
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
There was no answer.

246
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,840
I said, because if you prayed about it

247
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,000
and you believe that's the will of God,

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
then I'm all for it.

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,640
And that made them kind of like,

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
they didn't expect that answer.

251
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,720
They had not prayed about it.

252
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,760
They had not sought the face of God about it.

253
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,840
They just were going to make a decision.

254
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,880
And the reality is that sometimes in life,

255
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,160
that's how we can go through life.

256
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,840
We just make decisions.

257
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,280
Something happens, something's done that we don't like,

258
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,160
or whatever it might be,

259
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
and we just make a decision apart from seeking the Lord.

260
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,660
And so we find that here, there's the routine of life.

261
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,000
These people are just going through the routine of life,

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,560
just making the decisions,

263
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,560
just making the decisions based upon whatever factors here

264
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
it looks like for the economic gain that was possible

265
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,180
based upon the context of the verse.

266
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,520
But the reality is that in our lives,

267
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,860
we can do the same thing.

268
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,660
We can get stuck in the routine of life

269
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,060
and just going through the decision-making process

270
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,400
and really making decisions

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
without ever really consulting with God,

272
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,900
without ever really seeking the face of God.

273
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,620
What does God want me to do?

274
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,260
What does God want me to do in this situation?

275
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,340
Sometimes we make such an emphasis with young people.

276
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
What does God want you to do with your life?

277
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,600
And that's such an important question for a young person,

278
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
but I would say this,

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,200
it's such an important question for every aged person.

280
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Why?

281
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,520
Because God has a plan and a will for our lives,

282
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,480
regardless of what stage we are in in life,

283
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
if God has not taken us home to glory,

284
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,080
God has a will and a purpose for our lives.

285
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,560
What does God want me to do?

286
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,920
Verse number 14, number two, the reality of brevity.

287
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,060
These people are going to receive

288
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,840
really some correction in verse number 14.

289
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,140
I don't think this is what they were probably thinking

290
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,360
that they were going to hear.

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,960
Ye that say, these are some people that are,

292
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,600
obviously, they're a known group of people

293
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
that are making these decisions.

294
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,580
Today or tomorrow, we're gonna go into such a city,

295
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,880
continue a year, buy, sell, and get gain.

296
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
Maybe they expected to hear James say,

297
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,840
hey, best of success to you.

298
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,240
Sometimes we use the phraseology, good luck,

299
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,080
I hope everything goes well, I hope you have success.

300
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,680
Nope, James says,

301
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,920
whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.

302
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,160
Well, that's kind of a wake-up call, isn't it not?

303
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,560
I mean, they said today or tomorrow, we're gonna go.

304
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,120
Not only are we gonna go today or tomorrow,

305
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,040
but we're gonna stay there for a year.

306
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,920
James says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

307
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,200
you know not what shall be on the morrow.

308
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Not only do you not know what's gonna be on the morrow,

309
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,160
you're making plans for the year.

310
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,460
You're gonna stay there, buy, sell, and get gain,

311
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,980
but there's gotta be this reality of brevity

312
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,660
that is brought up and brought to the attention

313
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,100
of the individuals, and they're going to be given

314
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,780
what I would refer to here as profitable counsel.

315
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,740
We find that here, James says,

316
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,060
ye know not what shall be on the morrow.

317
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,140
You know, isn't that true for every one of us?

318
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,340
How many of you have plans for tomorrow?

319
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,620
Don't be embarrassed if you do.

320
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,220
I have plans for tomorrow.

321
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,740
We have plans for tomorrow, right?

322
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,380
But the reality is that we don't know

323
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,820
that we have tomorrow, is that true?

324
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,660
Now I understand we make plans, we go through that process,

325
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,380
but we ought to be seeking the will of God in our plan

326
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,140
as we make our plans, but we find here

327
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,420
that we can make plans knowing and seeking the Lord

328
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,080
and knowing the will of God as we make our plans,

329
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,500
but we must keep in our minds the reality of brevity,

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,780
the fact that we don't know what's on the morrow.

331
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,860
We don't know.

332
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,180
I often say this, David makes the statement in 1 Samuel,

333
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,620
and I understand the context as to why David

334
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,740
said what he said.

335
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,060
He said, there's but a step between me and death.

336
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,500
And why did David say that?

337
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,380
Well, Saul made it his singular purpose in life

338
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,060
to kill David, and Saul tried to kill David himself

339
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,340
when he had no success.

340
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,660
He tried to enlist others to kill David.

341
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,100
Obviously, he tried to get the Philistines to kill David.

342
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,780
I mean, he did all that he could do,

343
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,860
and he was seeking David in all the coast of Israel.

344
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,740
He was doing everything he could possibly do to kill David,

345
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,820
and yet David says, am I but a dead dog?

346
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,300
I've not done anything.

347
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,820
David had opportunity, he did nothing,

348
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,100
and he says to Samuel, there's but a step

349
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,800
between me and death.

350
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,140
Now, that was a real situation for David

351
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,860
where he was on, I mean, he was being hunted,

352
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,180
and so he understood, there's but a step

353
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,100
between me and death.

354
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,420
Can I tell you, though, that's true for all of us.

355
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,960
It's true for all of us.

356
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,380
There are people, I was getting alerts on my phone

357
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,480
when I was in Panama of accidents that took place

358
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,300
in northern Virginia and shut down roadways

359
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,260
and people were killed in those accidents.

360
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,300
It happens every day.

361
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,640
It happens every day.

362
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,020
And so the reality of brevity is brought to our attention

363
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,500
in verse 14, it's brought to the attention

364
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,820
of these within the group that are being addressed,

365
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,860
those that James is writing to.

366
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,540
He says, listen, you know not what shall be on the morrow,

367
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,600
and then he asks this question, for what is your life?

368
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,140
I wonder, do we ever really sit down

369
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,540
and consider what is our life?

370
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,460
I remember asking somebody this question

371
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,660
a number of years ago.

372
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,100
In fact, there was a period of time

373
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,940
where I'd ask this question repeatedly

374
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,380
at different people that I've spoken to.

375
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,420
I've not asked it recently,

376
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,380
but I remember asking a man

377
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,780
as I was sharing the gospel with him,

378
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,040
I said, listen, 500 years from now, what's gonna matter?

379
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,860
And he looked at me and he said, 500 years?

380
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,140
I was like, yeah, 500 years from now,

381
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,059
what's gonna, what in your life

382
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,220
is gonna amount to anything?

383
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,119
And he's like, nothing.

384
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,260
No one's even gonna know that I lived.

385
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,059
And I'm like, yeah, pretty much.

386
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,059
I mean, unless you do something extremely significant

387
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,500
to change the course of history,

388
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,020
you're not gonna be remembered 500 years from now.

389
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,460
But what we do for Christ, oh man, that's gonna count.

390
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
That's going to matter.

391
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,140
That's gonna make a difference, amen?

392
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,400
And you can talk about whatever car you bought,

393
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,059
whatever size house you lived in,

394
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,700
whatever, whatever, whatever,

395
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,420
but all that stuff is just not gonna matter.

396
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,460
And we find that he asked this question,

397
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,980
what is your life?

398
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,500
What is your life?

399
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,700
And then he gives an answer.

400
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,100
It is even a vapor that appears for a little time

401
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,559
and then vanisheth away.

402
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:09,279
Can you imagine, can you put yourself in the shoes of these that are being addressed in verse 13?

403
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,239
Go to now ye that say, there were some people that were saying, they were there,

404
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,559
and they were saying, here's what we're going to do,

405
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,039
we're going to either today or tomorrow, we're going to go into such a city,

406
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,919
we're going to continue a year, we're going to buy, sell, and gain.

407
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,999
And then they read this counsel from James where James says,

408
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,919
what is your life? It's even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.

409
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,959
Can you imagine, can you put yourself in their shoes? What a wake-up call.

410
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:45,119
What a reality that, hey, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow,

411
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,119
yet alone a year from now. Now, some of us make plans even a year from now.

412
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,519
I have plans for next year. As many of you know, I'm a planner.

413
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,519
I was asked to preach a Bible conference for somebody last week,

414
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,519
and they asked me three weeks before, and I said, brother, I'm going to be in Panama.

415
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,479
I made those plans way, way, way long ago, and so they sent me an email today and said,

416
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,959
how was the trip, or a text message, how was the trip to Panama?

417
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,959
I said, it was great. I said, how was your Bible conference?

418
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,879
They said, it was good, but we really would like for you to come.

419
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,279
And I was like, listen, I'm not trying to be unkind, but I plan things in advance,

420
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,599
so if you really want me to come, you better let me know the dates as soon as you know what they are.

421
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,839
And not that I get asked to preach a lot, but I do have things on the calendar,

422
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:33,519
but I don't put those things on the calendar without seeking the will of the Lord, number one,

423
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,439
and I don't put them on the calendar presuming that I'm actually going to be here.

424
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:43,680
I don't know, and you don't know. And these individual believers,

425
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,479
this group that were making these plans, they are given this profitable counsel,

426
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,360
and it is a reality that every one of us must acknowledge in our lives.

427
00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:02,879
Indeed, our life is brief. It's illustrated here as a vapor. We find that Psalm 102 and

428
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:10,479
verse number 11 illustrates our lives as being a shadow, and we understand the brevity of life.

429
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,360
How many times you live, I remember when I was a teenager, many of you can remember back to

430
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,160
being a teenager in school, and you felt like time kind of just stood still, and you could not

431
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,959
wait for the school year to get over. I wasn't one that really loved school a whole lot. I did

432
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:31,599
well and so on and so forth, but man, it just felt like the school year would take forever.

433
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,199
And then you become an adult. Somebody said this, it feels like time is faster. Do you ever feel

434
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:46,239
that way? Now here, the reality is that time is no faster. It's a second is a second, a minute is a

435
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:51,759
minute, an hour is an hour. It's not getting any faster, but life just seems like, man, you blink

436
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,639
and you look back. Next, not this Saturday, but next Saturday, Nova's gonna be one. We're gonna

437
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:01,599
be celebrating her one-year birthday, and it's like, man, I remember like it was just yesterday

438
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,520
when we were being told that she, we all can relate to those things. You have family dynamics

439
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,679
that you can relate to those things, and it's amazing how quickly time goes. Sometimes you talk

440
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,919
to some of these young people and they say, I can't wait to be, and they'll name an age because

441
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,319
I just want to be done with this, and you're like, hold on, it's going to come fast enough, right?

442
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:30,720
Just enjoy this stage in your life. And so the reality of brevity, number three, verse number 15,

443
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,000
what should our response be to this truth, our response to this truth? We see

444
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,279
the routine of life, the reality of brevity, and now we see our response.

445
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:50,559
Notice in verse 15, for that ye ought to say. See, they were saying, according to verse number 13,

446
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,440
go to now ye that say. Here's what they were saying. Today or tomorrow we will go into such

447
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,360
a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain. And James, after giving them

448
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:11,199
this profitable counsel with regard to the brevity of life, he says, for that ye ought to say. Let me

449
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,600
correct, let me make an adjustment to how you're dealing with life. Because you're living life a

450
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,839
certain way, you're doing what you've always known to do, you're doing maybe what other people are

451
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:30,559
doing, you're doing what's customary, what's culturally acceptable, and you're saying what

452
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,600
everybody else is saying. But you're a Christian, you're a child of God, you belong to Christ, and

453
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,600
your life is in his hand, and he has a purpose and a will for you. And so here's what you're saying,

454
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
but here's what you ought to say. Do you see how he makes that connection from verse 13 to 15?

455
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,559
In between, he gives the profitable counsel. He says, here's what you're saying, ye that say,

456
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,919
for that ye ought to say, verse 15. And so here's what James is going to tell them that they ought

457
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:10,320
to say, if the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that. So we find that James is giving

458
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,519
counsel again by way of introduction. I talked about hearing these messages in these lessons,

459
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,519
and not just because I'm delivering them, but as we study the Word of God, that we have the

460
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,279
opportunity to come face to face with truth that God has revealed to us. And we find that God says,

461
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:34,399
here's what you ought to do. What do we do when we read that? What do we do when God reveals

462
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:42,720
a truth, a principle, that we ought to be doing in our lives? Do we evaluate? Do we make the

463
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,040
adjustments that are necessary? James is really kind of forward, in a forward way, making the

464
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,320
adjustment for them. It's like we get opportunity to sit in a private counseling session with these

465
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,959
individuals. Though we do not know their names or know who they are, we know they're real people,

466
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:03,359
and James knew their situation. He says, here's what you're saying, but here's what you ought to

467
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:10,639
say. You need to make an adjustment on your perspective in life, because you're making

468
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:17,440
decisions, you're making plans, without ever even consulting the Lord to know the will of God.

469
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,399
And so what does James do? He corrects them. He reminds them of the brevity of life. He helps

470
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:30,959
them to have this perspective that is so important for the people of God to have, and then he says,

471
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:36,160
after acknowledging the truth of the brevity of life, after acknowledging the fact that you don't

472
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:44,559
know what's on the morrow, here's what you should say, if the Lord will. If the Lord will, we shall

473
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:51,519
live and do this or that. I would say this tonight, when we think about our response to the truth,

474
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:58,079
number one, we should acknowledge God's gift of life. We should acknowledge God's gift of life.

475
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm thankful for the gift of God, which is eternal life, and I'm thankful to be a possessor of

476
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,239
eternal life, that I've been saved by the grace of God, but I also recognize that every day that I

477
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,959
have physical life is a gift from God. Every day is a gift from God, and we ought to thank

478
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:23,440
God for the gift of life, and we ought to cherish God's gift of life. We ought to be thankful for

479
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,880
the days that God gives us. We ought to rejoice in the fact, the psalmist said in Psalm 118,

480
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,040
in verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it, and it's that

481
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,720
decision that the psalmist is making, that I'm going to rejoice because this is the day the

482
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,839
Lord hath made, and we're not going to live under the circumstances. No, we're going to keep our

483
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,480
eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, and we're going to keep on keeping on.

484
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,000
We're going to do the will of God, and we're going to cherish the gift of God that he gave us in

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,959
physical life. I would say this, and obviously it's the thought throughout the evening,

486
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,519
what should our response be? Our response should be that we seek God's will for our lives, that we

487
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:16,160
seek the face of God, that we determine this little phrase that is given to us in verse 15,

488
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,559
if the Lord will, this determination of what God's will is for our lives. The reality is that

489
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,640
this phrase, if the Lord will, this should not, it cannot simply be a Christian cliche that we use.

490
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:40,159
It must be our perspective in life. There's a young man that on Wednesday evening I met in

491
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,159
Panama for the first time. Their services on Thursday night were going out soul winning,

492
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,719
and he walked up to me, and he's a Panamanian. I mean, he looks Panamanian, and he walked up to me

493
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:55,440
with almost perfect English and said, I'm Julius Caesar. And I was like, because very few people

494
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,919
had English that was extremely easy to understand, and I was like, all right, Julius Caesar, here we

495
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,080
go. I said, you know English? I mean, he was, man, he could speak English great. And I got to talk

496
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,400
with him, and then he ended up being my soul winning partner that evening, and we had a great

497
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,200
night. And he shared with me that he was engaged to get married, and he was planning to get married

498
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:24,400
in February. And so I did not know this, but I had met the fiance earlier, but I did not have

499
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,200
put the two together. And so the next day I put the two together that that's the fiance of this

500
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,359
guy, so on and so forth. Her name is Lily. And I said to Lily, I said, so you're getting married?

501
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,039
And she said, I said, when are you getting married? And I don't know if she said this to anyone else

502
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,080
that was in the group, but here's her answer to me. If the Lord will, I'm going to get married in

503
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,200
February. And I thought to myself when she said that, I was like, you know, she's not using that

504
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,000
as a cliche. She was being honest and sincere that between now and February, there's a number

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,400
of months and she doesn't know. It's a plan that they've made. She's accepted.

506
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,520
He proposed, she's accepted the proposal,

507
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,620
she said yes, she's got a ring, they're gonna make plans.

508
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,020
Someone was actually from the group inquiring,

509
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,440
I think it was on Sunday night after the service

510
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,220
or after the meal and heading back to the hotel,

511
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,660
inquiring about the plans and what the cultural aspects are

512
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,980
of weddings in Panama and so on and so forth

513
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,260
and getting some information and it was good,

514
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,940
but she had this perspective, if the Lord will.

515
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,660
Oh, how we need to have that perspective in life.

516
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,680
It's not just a cliche.

517
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,740
We make plans, but we make plans

518
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,660
according to the will of God.

519
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,620
We do not make plans based upon the opportunities,

520
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,500
we make plans based upon the will of God.

521
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,460
The opportunity for these individuals,

522
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,940
according to what we can gather from verse 13,

523
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,780
is that there was a place where no doubt

524
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,960
their goods were needed, that they felt like

525
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,720
there was an avenue where they could buy, sell, and gain.

526
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,840
But the economic opportunity was not the determining factor

527
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,080
for their decision, it could not be, it must not be,

528
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,800
it must be what is the will of God.

529
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,840
See, because they're now saved people

530
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,800
that belong to Christ.

531
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,180
We are bought with a price,

532
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,600
Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 6, we are not our own.

533
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,480
Now let me ask you, when we talk about the idea

534
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,360
of being bought with a price, what does that mean?

535
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,380
It means that we're saved.

536
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,760
If I could boil it down to a very simple statement,

537
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,580
when Paul says that we're bought with a price,

538
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,440
it means that we've been saved, that we've accepted

539
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,080
the gift of God which is eternal life,

540
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,240
that Jesus paid it all, and we are bought with that price.

541
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,360
He paid for our salvation.

542
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,720
And he says you're not your own.

543
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,560
Now here's the amazing thing.

544
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,120
Somebody said this years ago, I remember reading in a book,

545
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,180
they said too many people in American Christianity today

546
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,180
want a savior but they don't want a Lord.

547
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,260
They don't want a master.

548
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,660
They want a savior.

549
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,180
So they want the I've been bought with a price

550
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,460
but they don't want the I'm not my own.

551
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,540
But you understand that there are one and the same.

552
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,540
If I'm bought with a price, I'm not my own, amen?

553
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,180
And so it cannot be that we simply want a savior

554
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,260
and say no, I don't want a Lord or master.

555
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,300
Jesus in fact said this, why call you me Lord, Lord

556
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,820
and do not the things that I say?

557
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Well that's an indictment.

558
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,540
He says you're calling me Lord but yet you're not doing

559
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,900
the things that I say.

560
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,300
And so here the response of the people of God

561
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,860
here as James is writing to these individuals

562
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,740
in the first century but for us tonight in 2024

563
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,220
that we look at our lives and we make decisions

564
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,580
and no doubt each of us are faced with decisions

565
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,060
every day of our lives whether it's a decision

566
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,100
with regard to a job opportunity, a decision with regard

567
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,100
to a moving, a location, a residence, whatever it might be,

568
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,700
there are decisions that we make and we find in life

569
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,940
that sometimes it says man there are bigger decisions

570
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,100
and smaller decisions but understand that decisions

571
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,140
are going to be made and we must know the will of the Lord.

572
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,780
What does God want me to do?

573
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,380
What is God's will?

574
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,460
You know there are times in which God will not give you

575
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,700
a peace about a decision.

576
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,380
You ever been there before?

577
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,660
You feel like there's something you want to do

578
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,980
and God just doesn't give you a peace about it.

579
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,740
He doesn't give you that peace.

580
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,140
Oftentimes as I'm praying and seeking the Lord

581
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,300
and I say stuff like this to God and you can think

582
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm crazy if you want but I'm just being honest

583
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,900
and transparent, I say God I'm just dumb

584
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,140
and I need to know real clear and plain

585
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,100
because I can't figure it out, amen.

586
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,380
Like just beat me over the head with a four by four

587
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,660
and make it clear and because I want to know

588
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,020
what the will of the Lord is and I pray that God

589
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,100
would give me peace in the decision.

590
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,180
That he'd give me peace.

591
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,220
No doubt you've been in a place where you've started

592
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,500
to make a decision and God just gave you an uneasiness

593
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,020
in your spirit, he didn't give you that peace.

594
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,980
And that's God communing with us and helping us

595
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,980
and you know what, I don't have a peace about this.

596
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,660
This isn't the direction that I need to go in.

597
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,100
This isn't the decision I need to make.

598
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,140
And so again the perspective, our response to the truth

599
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,380
that is given to us in this text of scripture

600
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,740
must be that we determine that we are,

601
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,900
we ought to seek the Lord.

602
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,980
What does God want me to do?

603
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,760
What is God's will with regard to this situation?

604
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,860
And then I make the decision based upon the will of God

605
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,380
and I live for the glory of God.

606
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,460
I live out the plan that God has for me.

607
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,660
It says that you ought to say if the Lord will,

608
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,540
we shall live and do this or that.

609
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,780
God has a will for your life, he has a will for my life,

610
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,900
he has a will for all of us.

611
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,780
For many, obviously for all of us that are saved tonight,

612
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,460
there are many things that we could say

613
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,020
are the consistent revealed will of God for all of us.

614
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,340
It's God's will for us to go to church, amen.

615
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,500
Somebody said are you gonna go to church

616
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,340
when I'm gonna pray about it?

617
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,380
You don't really need to pray about it.

618
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,140
God said go to church.

619
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,980
It's not something you pray about,

620
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,300
it's just a matter of obedience.

621
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
Then we go down the line and begin to see

622
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,820
should I take this job or this job?

623
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,460
There's no verse in God's word that's gonna tell you

624
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,820
what job you should take.

625
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,460
It's just not there.

626
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,940
But you seek the face of God.

627
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,580
You determine I wanna know the will of God.

628
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,020
God, would you give me wisdom?

629
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,060
Would you give me understanding?

630
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,580
Would you make it clear to me?

631
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,780
I want to be in the place where you want me to be.

632
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,180
I wanna do your will.

633
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,460
I don't wanna make the decision

634
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,220
based upon whatever these factors may be.

635
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,640
When I went to work at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation,

636
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,300
I had another job offer on the table the same day

637
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,840
that was for about $20,000 more a year.

638
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,700
God gave me no peace for that job.

639
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,100
God gave me peace for the other job.

640
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I don't know why.

641
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,180
If you look at it from a backup perspective,

642
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,620
you say man, that one's got more money,

643
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,860
it's got more opportunity, it's got,

644
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,500
but I don't know why God didn't give me a peace about it,

645
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,860
but he didn't, and God gave me a peace about this job,

646
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,660
that job at the time, 17 years ago now,

647
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,120
and that's where, that's how God led.

648
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,640
Sometimes we take the factors

649
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,020
on how we determine the decision-making process,

650
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,480
and we adopt a lot of the world's philosophies.

651
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,820
You ever hear somebody say put all the pros on one side

652
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,940
and all the cons on the other side?

653
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,060
That's how you make decisions?

654
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,660
Anyone ever hear somebody say that?

655
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,200
No, no, as a Christian, that's not how we make decisions.

656
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,260
We make decisions based on what is the will of God?

657
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,500
What does God want me to do?

658
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,800
We need to seek the Lord.

659
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Let's pray.

660
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,540
Father, we love you.

661
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,740
We thank you for loving us.

662
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,960
Thank you for your word.

663
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,980
Thank you for this wonderful counsel

664
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,500
that you give us in James,

665
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,260
and I pray that you'd help us, Lord.

666
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,140
Again, it's a familiar passage of scripture,

667
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,300
and we've considered the passage before

668
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,540
from other perspectives,

669
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,740
and focus on the brevity of life,

670
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,860
and it's there, and it's clear,

671
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,100
and God, we're thankful that you've given us that truth,

672
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,220
but I do pray that tonight you'd help us,

673
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,100
and we see in that 15th verse,

674
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,540
for that ye ought to say, if the Lord will,

675
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,600
we would do this or that.

676
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,280
Lord, I pray that you would help us to seek your face,

677
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,840
to seek your will.

678
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,100
Lord, that we would not use it as a cliche,

679
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,380
but that we would earnestly, sincerely desire

680
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,660
to know your will for our lives.

681
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,140
Help us to walk in obedience.

682
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,580
Help us, Lord, to evaluate

683
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,300
and to make adjustments that are needed.

684
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,380
Well, thank you for what you'll do.

685
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,660
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

686
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,900
All right, on the back of the prayer bulletin,

687
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
anyone need a prayer bulletin before we?
