1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Kimberly, they'll be leaving bright and early.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,720
Actually, it'll be dark when you leave tomorrow morning,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,280
but we use the expression bright and early.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,359
Their flight leaves real early tomorrow morning,

5
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,000
so you pray for them.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,960
Of course, as we've mentioned several times

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,239
here in the last week, brother Sommerdorf's dad,

8
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,360
so Kimberly's grandfather,

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,079
went home to be with the Lord last week,

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,079
and so the funeral is on Friday,

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,600
and so if you would pray for the Sommerdorf family.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,399
My great aunt passed away yesterday,

13
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,559
and I got the information today,

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,600
and I was told that for years, unknown to me,

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,720
for years, she has said that she wants me

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,639
to preach her funeral, and I found that out today.

17
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,560
I found out she died yesterday, and I found out today,

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,040
and so I'm assuming on Saturday,

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm gonna be making a trip up to New Jersey

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,560
to preach a funeral for my great aunt,

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,360
and if you would pray for that, I would appreciate it,

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,720
and we got a number of family members that are not saved,

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,360
a number of family members that come together for funerals,

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,119
as perhaps many of you have that same situation,

25
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,040
and I'll preach the gospel.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,159
She was a lady that I believe,

27
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,479
through conversation with her,

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,919
she knew the Lord as her Savior,

29
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,760
so we're thankful for that,

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,319
but I know we have a lot of family members

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,040
that do not know the Lord as their Savior,

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,360
and so we certainly would appreciate your prayers

33
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
with regard to that.

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,680
First Thessalonians chapter number five this evening.

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,440
First Thessalonians chapter number five,

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
and be looking at verse number 15.

37
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,800
Of course, over the last several weeks,

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,879
this is actually lesson number eight,

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,040
as we have studied through this very concise,

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,639
yet applicable instruction that God gives

41
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,000
to the church at Thessalonica

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,760
at the end of this particular letter.

43
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,000
Again, the end of chapter number three of the second letter,

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,300
we find another list of bullet point instruction,

45
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,139
if you will, and we've gone through each Wednesday evening

46
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,940
looking at these pieces of instruction

47
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,279
as we've sought to be able to apply

48
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,599
this truth in our lives.

49
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,519
The Christian life, we know,

50
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,279
must be lived through the power of the Holy Spirit.

51
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,400
You try to live the Christian life in your own flesh,

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,559
your own power, it's gonna be frustrating,

53
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:07,080
and this is the truth that God did not design

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,600
that we would live the Christian life

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,919
in our own flesh, in our own power.

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,160
Remember, Jesus said in John 15,

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,820
without me, ye can do nothing,

58
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,559
and it's very interesting how often we find in the scriptures

59
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:22,080
that God instructs us to not do certain things

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,080
that would be natural to do in our flesh,

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,679
and so he instructs us not to do those things,

62
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,119
and then there are things that God instructs us to do

63
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:35,039
that naturally we don't wanna do in our flesh,

64
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,160
and why do we find those instructions?

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,139
Well, because God says this is what pleases me,

66
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,360
and so he instructs us accordingly,

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,880
and then we understand that we must live in dependence

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,440
on the Lord and the power of the Holy Spirit

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,600
in order to do the work that God has called us to do.

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,039
We must die to self, we must walk in the Spirit.

71
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,779
It is imperative that we are emptied of self

72
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,419
so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

73
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,580
You're not gonna be, we understand the truth,

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,279
the teaching that we are indwelled with the Spirit of God

75
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,880
at the moment of salvation,

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,960
but understand, though we received all of the Holy Spirit

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,479
at the moment of salvation that we'll ever have,

78
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,080
the reality is that he doesn't have all of you

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,080
or all of me on any given day,

80
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
and so we must yield ourselves,

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,119
we must be dead to self, emptied of self

82
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,559
so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit.

83
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,559
We find here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 15,

84
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,279
notice the Bible says this.

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,240
See that none render evil for evil unto any man,

86
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,080
but ever follow that which is good,

87
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:48,520
both among yourselves and to all men.

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,300
Hold your place here and turn to the book of Romans,

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,279
if you will, Romans chapter 12.

90
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,839
I wanna take a look at the instruction

91
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,320
that is given here in Romans chapter number 12

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,880
that really is a sister passage of scripture

93
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,759
with what we've just read in 1 Thessalonians 5.

94
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,880
Notice in Romans 12, beginning in verse number 17,

95
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,660
notice what the Bible says.

96
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Recompense to no man evil for evil.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,100
Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

98
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,239
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,

99
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,720
live peaceably with all men.

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,839
Notice 19, dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,

101
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,799
but rather give place unto wrath,

102
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,519
for it is written, vengeance is mine,

103
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,839
I will repay, saith the Lord.

104
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,440
Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him.

105
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
If he thirst, give him drink.

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
For in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

107
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,299
Verse 21, be not overcome of evil,

108
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,480
but overcome evil with good.

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,320
This is not natural.

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,880
It's not natural for your flesh or for my flesh,

111
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,959
but we find that the Lord gives us this instruction,

112
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,160
and as he gives us this instruction,

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,359
it reveals to us how desperately we need the Lord

114
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:03,440
in order to fulfill the instruction that he's provided.

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,579
Notice with me, I wanna mention two portions

116
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,119
of scripture principles, if you will,

117
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,519
from the book of Proverbs,

118
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,079
and then we'll get back to 1 Thessalonians chapter five.

119
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,799
Turn over very quickly, if you will, to Proverbs 24,

120
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,760
and look at verse number 29 with me,

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Proverbs 24 and verse number 29.

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,299
The Bible says here, say not, I will do so to him

123
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,200
as he hath done to me.

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,579
I will render to the man according to his work.

125
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,920
You find in chapter 25, maybe on the same page there

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,239
as Proverbs 24, verse 29, but in chapter 25

127
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,959
and verse number 21, notice what the Bible says.

128
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,200
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat,

129
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Does it sound like Romans chapter 12?

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,160
We just read it a moment ago.

132
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Sounds awfully similar.

133
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Verse 22, for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,679
and the Lord shall reward thee.

135
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,959
As we look at these portions of scripture

136
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,760
and turn back to 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,320
and we find that God is giving this instruction

138
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,399
to this local church, and he says,

139
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,339
see that none render evil for evil unto any man,

140
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,040
but ever follow that which is good,

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
both among yourselves and to all men.

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,799
No doubt in our lives, and maybe you experience this

143
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,399
personally before you trust that Christ is your Savior,

144
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,119
and we see it as we live life,

145
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,200
there are people that have the idea,

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,839
I'll do good to you as long as you do good to me,

147
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,760
and if you do evil to me, I'll do evil to you,

148
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,200
and it's kind of like that situation.

149
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,339
That's not how God has instructed believers to live,

150
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,119
and we find in this portion of scripture,

151
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm gonna use a title from the verse

152
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
over in Romans chapter number 12, verse 21,

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,279
the title overcome evil with good.

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,880
Overcome evil with good.

155
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,320
I notice two principles here,

156
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
really we're gonna look at these tonight,

157
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,519
and I hope that as we make application

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,119
that we'd be challenged in our walk with the Lord,

159
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,679
remember the title for this entire series

160
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,959
is Walk Worthy, Please God,

161
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,880
and so we notice number one, if you're taking notes,

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,760
a principle of grace, a principle of grace.

163
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,760
He says, see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

164
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,279
No doubt the people, the church members

165
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,839
of the church at Thessalonica,

166
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,000
as they interacted with people in the society,

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,320
we've already talked about the way

168
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,880
in which they suffered persecution,

169
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,160
and they were dealing with all sorts of things,

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,959
and no doubt they had interactions with people

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,640
where people treated them wrong.

172
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,359
And here, the Lord, the Holy Spirit of God

173
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,559
is the author of scripture.

174
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,920
He says, see that none render evil for evil,

175
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
notice, unto any man.

176
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,760
We find that the word see is an interesting word

177
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,600
for it really carries with it the idea

178
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,579
in this particular context of looking

179
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,959
at this verse of scripture is take heed.

180
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,279
In fact, the same Greek word is translated take heed

181
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,279
in Matthew 18 in verse number 10.

182
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,480
We're not gonna turn over there.

183
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,839
It's a different, it doesn't have anything to do

184
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,820
with this lesson this evening,

185
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,440
but we see that the word is translated that way.

186
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,279
And so the idea as we look at verse 15,

187
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,279
why is it that we need to be careful?

188
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,760
Why is it that we need to take heed?

189
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,279
Well, I believe the reason is because your flesh

190
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,760
desires to react in a certain way.

191
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,559
And my flesh desires to react in a certain way.

192
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,719
Someone said this as I was considering

193
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,919
and looking through things here.

194
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
It says if somebody punches you,

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,280
the first thing you wanna do is punch them back.

196
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,039
Right, we all can relate and understand that.

197
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,960
And so we need to take heed.

198
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,520
We need to, as it says here,

199
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,200
see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

200
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,820
Your flesh has a desire to react in situations

201
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,239
in a certain way.

202
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,960
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture

203
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,580
and with God's help, we can be gracious.

204
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,440
Again, it's a principle of grace,

205
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,440
and we can respond as opposed to reacting.

206
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,880
And see, there's always a situation

207
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,320
when you deal with things in life,

208
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
when I deal with things in life,

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,719
are we reacting to that thing

210
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,000
or are we responding to that thing?

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,840
There's a difference between reacting and responding.

212
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
And we find this evening that here,

213
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,039
this principle of grace where he says,

214
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,700
see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

215
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,940
We are to be gracious.

216
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,340
In fact, we find that even in our speech,

217
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,020
Paul encourages the believers in Colossae

218
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,659
that they're to let their speech be,

219
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,500
what, it's supposed to be gracious,

220
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,580
seasoned with salt, right?

221
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,900
He says in Colossians 4 and verse number six,

222
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,679
let your speech be always with grace.

223
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,159
If we'd examine our speech,

224
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,219
if we would listen to the things that we say,

225
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,679
no doubt there are times in which our speech

226
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,679
is not always with grace.

227
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,080
And we're to be gracious.

228
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,600
I've heard people say I want to give him a piece of my mind and I'll jokingly respond

229
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,720
make sure it's not the last piece.

230
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,480
And the reality is that we need to always, as he says in Colossians 4 and verse 6, speak

231
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,620
with grace.

232
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,760
Let me say this tonight, to be gracious is to be like Jesus.

233
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,560
To overcome evil with good is to be like the Lord.

234
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,320
Do you remember what Jesus endured when he was going to the cross of Calvary?

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,200
Do you remember all that he suffered?

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,820
And yes we understand as he suffered and he bled and died he was paying for our sin but

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,840
we understand that as he was reviled he reviled not again.

238
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,960
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ he said this, Father forgive them for they know not

239
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
what they do.

240
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,640
Can you imagine the grace?

241
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,160
We understand that our God is gracious and as his people we too are to be gracious.

242
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Look over if you will to 1 Peter chapter number 2, I referenced a portion of one of the verses

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,680
here that we're going to look at in 1 Peter chapter number 2.

244
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,080
But notice with me beginning in verse number 21 as we think about this principle of grace,

245
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
this principle of grace.

246
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,120
You know God's people are to be gracious people.

247
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm thankful that we serve a gracious God and that we have received grace and then we

248
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,800
too are to give grace, we're to be gracious.

249
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:36,740
In 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, notice what the Bible says, for even here unto were ye called.

250
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,280
Because Christ also suffered for us.

251
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:47,920
Notice what it says, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps.

252
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,360
Now if it ended there we could say yes as we examine the life of Christ we understand

253
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,480
that he left us an example, there's so many things we could study within the life of Christ

254
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,240
and say what an example that is to us.

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,480
But we find that the Holy Spirit of God in this portion of scripture zeroes into something

256
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,000
specifically with regard to the example that he's speaking of.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,560
Notice in verse 22, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

258
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,480
We understand the just for the unjust as he'll say in chapter number 3.

259
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,600
We find that it says this in verse 23, who when he was reviled, reviled not again.

260
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:40,400
When he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

261
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,780
You know so often if we're not careful as we live in this world and we deal with individuals

262
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,980
and we have interactions and we deal with hardships and difficulties, we can be tempted

263
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,520
to respond in the flesh because we want to get even, we want to get back this idea maybe

264
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,260
if you could look at this portion of scripture with the thought of one that would be seeking

265
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,180
revenge.

266
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,540
And yet we find that the Holy Spirit of God so often as he's speaking to his people in

267
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,020
the New Testament, as he's giving us the word of God, he's writing to us and he's giving

268
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,900
us instruction that at the face value we look at it and say how in the world could

269
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I do this?

270
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,380
Well you can't apart from the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

271
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,860
And Christians are to be different.

272
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,740
You know I think that's one of the problems that we have in America today is that so many

273
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,100
Christians have, Christians quote unquote because probably a lot of them aren't even

274
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,520
saved people, but they've so assimilated to the world and they want to be accepted by

275
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,680
the world, they don't want to ruffle any feathers so to speak, that there's no difference.

276
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,880
They don't see any difference in our behavior.

277
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,080
I was sent some email or I was sent some videos and I saw them and I talked to a pastor friend

278
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,400
about one of them yesterday, but I was given some videos of some quote unquote churches

279
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,200
in America that a couple of weeks ago on Super Bowl Sunday, some of the things that happened

280
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,800
in their churches in the name of Christianity, it was absolutely appalling.

281
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,920
It was blasphemous.

282
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,360
They were literally kicking a Bible on the platform like it was a football.

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,400
That's unbelievable to me.

284
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,200
We're called to be different.

285
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,720
What did Jesus say in Matthew 5?

286
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,800
Look if you do good to those that do good to you, like even the publicans do that.

287
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,040
Publicans are to be different.

288
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,320
And so he says, see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

289
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,400
You want to see just how alive your flesh is?

290
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,160
Let somebody treat you wrong, amen?

291
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:01,240
And you're going to find out in a hurry how alive that old man can be revived, amen?

292
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,600
You let somebody treat you wrong and it's amazing.

293
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,720
You can, I'm telling you, I've experienced, you can be walking in the spirit, you can

294
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,200
be singing the sweet songs from our hymnal and just rejoicing in the Lord, and then somebody

295
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,640
does something and man that old man is just like, bam.

296
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,840
I mean he's alive and well, but we're to crucify him.

297
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,960
We cannot do this in our own power.

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,080
The instruction that we find is instruction that helps us recognize how desperately we

299
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,100
need the Lord.

300
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,880
He said, and we'll look at it in John 15, we'll look at the two verses at the end, but

301
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,160
without me you can do nothing.

302
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,680
Notice a principle of grace, notice number two as we look at the remainder of the verse

303
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,520
of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 15, a pursuit of good.

304
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,280
A pursuit of good, notice what he says, but ever follow that, which is good, literally

305
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,040
the idea of follow that is pursuing after, and so he says, but ever follow that which

306
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
is good.

307
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Then he says this, both among yourselves, remember who's he writing to, he's writing

308
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:17,080
to the church at Thessalonica, so among yourselves, but then notice he says, and to all men.

309
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,360
And so we are to be doing good, not only doing good, but pursuing good.

310
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,680
The word good, it carries with it that idea of that which is upright, that which is honorable.

311
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,640
How do we determine what is good?

312
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,200
Is it for your determination?

313
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Am I the standard?

314
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,680
No, God is the standard.

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,560
And when we understand that we're pursuing and we're seeking to do that which is right,

316
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,480
that which is upright and honorable, that which is pleasing to God, he says that we're

317
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,600
to do good, we're to follow after, but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves

318
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
and to all men.

319
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Looking, again, not only doing what's good, but pursuing good.

320
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,280
And notice he says, not only among yourselves, but to all men.

321
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,000
So we see this principle of grace that we find at the beginning of chapter 5 and verse

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
number 15, see that none render evil for evil unto any man, but then we see this pursuit

323
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,000
of good, and we understand, remember the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly ministry,

324
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,760
one man comes to him and calls him good.

325
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,560
He says, why callest thou me good?

326
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,760
And we find this evening that we live in a society where they call evil good and good

327
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
evil.

328
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
We understand that.

329
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,360
The prophets speak of that, and no doubt we live in that situation.

330
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,140
I had to be on the phone today with someone from Fairfax County, and I said, so and so,

331
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,280
with all due respect, I want to make a comment that I do not want you to respond to, because

332
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,680
I wasn't trying to get them in trouble.

333
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,280
But what they were telling me was absolutely ludicrous.

334
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,240
And I said, what you're telling me is you're violating our constitutional rights to live

335
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,440
out our faith.

336
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
It's bizarre.

337
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,920
But we're to do good.

338
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,320
We're to do good.

339
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
God determines what is good.

340
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,520
We live in a society that is upside down.

341
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,680
I mean, they don't have the right moral code.

342
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,840
And we find that as we go to God's Word, we can't be influenced by the society, by the

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
culture.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,640
We can't say, well, everyone else is doing it.

345
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,240
You ever hear somebody say that?

346
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Your kids want to do something, and you say, well, why do you want to do that?

347
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,720
Well, everyone else is doing it.

348
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,440
I remember with our children, because it was said to me, they said, well, if, my parents

349
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,160
said, if your brother jumps off a bridge, are you going to jump off a bridge?

350
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,080
I don't know if any of you heard that when you were growing up or said that to your children.

351
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,600
So, I said that to Joseph one day, and he says, with all sincerity, he says, yes.

352
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
And I said, Joseph, if your sister jumps off the bridge, are you going to jump off the

353
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
bridge too?

354
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
And he's like, yes.

355
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,760
I said, bud, did you understand the question?

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,239
He says, yes.

357
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:04,320
She's going to need help, so I'm going to try to help her.

358
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,119
And I thought, well, that just fell apart on me.

359
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,440
I mean, it's just terrible, right?

360
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
Like, what do you say?

361
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,080
But we notice when God says that we're to pursue that which is good ever, but ever follow

362
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,960
that which is good, don't allow the society in which we're living where everyone else

363
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,360
is doing it, and it just seems to be accepted.

364
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,040
Maybe even people within churches, those that call themselves believers and Christians,

365
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,679
they're doing these things and say, well, I guess it's okay.

366
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,679
No, no.

367
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,119
We need to go to God and figure out what's good.

368
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,720
Live accordingly.

369
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,840
I said this, to be gracious is to be like Jesus.

370
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,679
Let me say this, to do good is to be like Jesus.

371
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,760
Notice in Acts chapter 10, if you will, in Acts chapter number 10, we find that we pick

372
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,200
ourselves up in this portion of Scripture where Peter is preaching.

373
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
Why is he preaching?

374
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Well, because Cornelius had a vision,

375
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,300
and in that vision, Cornelius is told to send for Peter,

376
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,800
and Peter at the same time is having that vision, right?

377
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
He's hungry and he has this vision,

378
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
and God instructs him to go with these

379
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,980
that would come to the house, and we find that he does,

380
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,640
and as he finds himself there,

381
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,540
the Bible tells us, as they enter in Caesarea

382
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,280
in verse number 24, that Cornelius waited for them

383
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

384
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,040
I mean, this is an awesome opportunity.

385
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,780
Cornelius is gonna hear, listen,

386
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,580
the angel could not tell Cornelius how to be saved.

387
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,980
All the angel could do was tell Cornelius

388
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,000
where he had to go in order to get the true message,

389
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and so Peter comes, and we find that as he arrives,

390
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
there's this crowd here that's gathered,

391
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,940
and the introduction has gone on.

392
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,460
Notice, if you will, pick it up with me

393
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,120
in verse number 33, immediately therefore I sent to thee,

394
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,660
this is Cornelius speaking,

395
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,200
and thou hast well done that thou art come.

396
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,360
He's talking to Peter.

397
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
He says at the end of verse 33,

398
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,160
now therefore are we all here present before God

399
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,700
to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

400
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,340
Then Peter opened his mouth.

401
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,440
What an easy sermon to preach.

402
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,380
I mean, honestly, Cornelius has done all the work

403
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,740
to gather all the people and said,

404
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,580
we're here to hear what you have to say,

405
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,500
and he opens his mouth and begins to preach,

406
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,740
and what does he begin to preach?

407
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,200
He begins to preach about the Lord Jesus Christ.

408
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,780
By the way, that's our message, preaching Christ.

409
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,380
Amen?

410
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,580
We find that he says this.

411
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,220
Notice, I'm gonna jump right in the middle of his message.

412
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,760
He then gets into the death, burial, and resurrection,

413
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,220
but notice in verse 38,

414
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,220
a pursuit of good is our thought

415
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,020
from 1 Thessalonians 5, 15.

416
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,260
I said to do good is to be like Jesus.

417
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,940
Notice in verse 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
with the Holy Ghost and with power

419
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,640
who went about doing good

420
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,600
and healing all that were oppressed of the devil,

421
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,340
for God was with him, and we are witnesses of all things,

422
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,940
which he did both in the land of the Jews

423
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,340
and in Jerusalem, who they slew

424
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,420
and hanged on a tree.

425
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,920
Him, God raised up the third day and showed him openly,

426
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,720
and so we see that he preaches the gospel,

427
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
but notice in verse 38, he says,

428
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,880
who went about doing good.

429
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,260
Who went about doing good.

430
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,320
The instruction there in 1 Thessalonians

431
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,720
is that we're to ever follow that which is good,

432
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,160
that we're to be pursuing good.

433
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,900
You're only gonna determine what is good

434
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,460
as you dig into God's word and you decide

435
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,100
that God will have the authority and the standard

436
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,500
for determining what is good and right,

437
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,340
that which is upright and honorable.

438
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,240
How is it that we're to live,

439
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,540
and what is it that we're to do

440
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,700
in this perverse generation in which we live?

441
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,620
We live in a crooked and perverse generation.

442
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,080
Paul said that to the believers in Philippi.

443
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,420
And so we find that we live in that situation,

444
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,620
but we're to shine as lights in a dark place,

445
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,960
and that's what we're to do.

446
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,660
And so we find that here, Paul is giving this instruction

447
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,300
of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

448
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,860
to the church at Thessalonica,

449
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,700
and he says there's this principle of grace

450
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,600
and there's this pursuit of good,

451
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,140
and we find that in both of those truths

452
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,640
that are given in verse 15 of chapter five,

453
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,400
that really what Paul is saying

454
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,880
to the believers in Thessalonica

455
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
and what God is saying to us tonight

456
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
is that we're to be like Jesus.

457
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
That's not what Christians are supposed to be.

458
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
Why were they first called Christians in Antioch?

459
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,160
Well, because they were like Christ.

460
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,080
And we find that we as Christians,

461
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,560
someone said this, I like your Christ,

462
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,880
but I don't like your Christians.

463
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
He went on to say this,

464
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,260
the reason why he made that statement

465
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,260
is because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

466
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,980
Now that's a heavy indictment, is it not?

467
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,340
He said, I like your Christ, but not your Christians.

468
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,180
Why?

469
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,140
Because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

470
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,280
We've lost our way, we've lost our identity.

471
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,020
If we're standing up on a platform,

472
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,460
kicking a Bible around,

473
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,580
and that would never happen here, I understand that,

474
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,900
and I think for all of us that are here this evening,

475
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,140
that if you found yourself in a church like that

476
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,900
on a Sunday morning by accident,

477
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,020
I hope you would get up and walk out, amen?

478
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,900
But the reality is that there are,

479
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,780
this is happening all around America.

480
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,140
It's sickening.

481
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,060
You know, it's interesting, C.H. Spurgeon said this,

482
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,420
and C.H. Spurgeon, I don't know, 150 years ago roughly,

483
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,700
somewhere in that ballpark,

484
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,620
and so C.H. Spurgeon said this,

485
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,900
what's happening too often,

486
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,380
it was a downgrade controversy,

487
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,280
you can read about it, all this stuff that's going on,

488
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,780
but he made this statement, he wrote an article about it,

489
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,020
really a great statement,

490
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,940
and once thought what was happening,

491
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,120
he said, the church is entertaining the goats.

492
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,660
If it was true then, oh, how it's become true today.

493
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,120
And you know, there are these churches that think,

494
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,620
well, we have a big crowd.

495
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,700
So what?

496
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,660
It's not about the number of people.

497
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,520
It's about, listen, God is the one

498
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,500
that determines how we worship, amen?

499
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,260
Not everything that's called worship today is worship.

500
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,860
He said you're to worship me in spirit and in truth.

501
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,700
And he is a holy, reverent God.

502
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,660
What happened when the boys tried to offer

503
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,820
some strange fire in the Old Testament?

504
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,660
They died.

505
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,140
What happened when they decided

506
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,780
they were gonna move the ark on the cart

507
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,020
and Uzzah's gonna hold it?

508
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,860
What happens?

509
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,660
He dies, right?

510
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,740
We serve a holy God.

511
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,300
We have to enter into his presence accordingly.

512
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,860
And so what Paul is saying is that we're to live like Jesus.

513
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,900
We're to be like Jesus.

514
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,580
Because to be gracious is to be like our Savior.

515
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,740
To do good is to be like our Savior.

516
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,380
And so look in John chapter 15.

517
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,660
I said we'd finish here and I want you to notice.

518
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,880
We're gonna read five verses

519
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,960
and then we'll be done this evening.

520
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,500
We'll get into our prayer time.

521
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,740
In John 15 and verse number one,

522
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,800
no doubt you're familiar with the portion of Scripture,

523
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,400
but I think it's important that we read it

524
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,840
and we get it just solidified in our minds

525
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,000
once again this evening.

526
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,120
Jesus says, I am the true vine.

527
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,480
My father's the husbandman.

528
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit,

529
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
he taketh away.

530
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
And every branch that beareth fruit,

531
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,420
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

532
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,160
Now you're clean through the word

533
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,360
which I have spoken unto you.

534
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,940
Abide in me and I in you.

535
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,240
Notice that the branch cannot bear fruit of itself

536
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,440
except it abide in the vine.

537
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,580
No more can he except you abide in me.

538
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,160
We understand this from a physical perspective.

539
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,600
How many of you, well, I don't wanna have you

540
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,560
raise your hands because maybe you get in trouble,

541
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
but some people probably bought flowers

542
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,460
for their spouse on Valentine's Day.

543
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,800
And you bought those flowers

544
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,920
and man, they were probably beautiful

545
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,240
when you picked them up and you took them home

546
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
and they looked real nice.

547
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,780
But today, a week later, they probably don't look as nice.

548
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,460
Maybe you've already had to throw them out.

549
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,720
Maybe you got them from somewhere

550
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
where they just didn't last

551
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,400
as long as you'd hoped that they'd last.

552
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,640
Why is it that they die?

553
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
Why do the petals fall off?

554
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,840
Why do they droop over and turn colors?

555
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,400
Well, because they've been severed, right?

556
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,000
They've been cut from the source,

557
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,120
the vine that gives them life.

558
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,440
So you can change the water, you can put the food in,

559
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,280
you can do all the stuff that you wanna do,

560
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
but it's gonna just be short-lived.

561
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,420
So Jesus uses this illustration,

562
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,420
it'll be very easy for people to understand and relate to,

563
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,820
and he says in verse number five,

564
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,560
I am the vine, ye are the branches.

565
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
By the way, it's a good thing for us

566
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,040
to recognize and remember our place.

567
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,240
We are not the vine, he is the vine.

568
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,600
Sometimes we think we're the ones

569
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
that are in control of my life, I'm gonna do,

570
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,020
no, no, we're just the branch, he is the vine.

571
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,580
He is the vine, and he says this,

572
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,500
he that abideth in me and I in him,

573
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,260
the same bringeth forth much fruit,

574
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,180
for without me ye can do nothing.

575
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,060
You know what I fear?

576
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I fear that a lot of people really don't believe that verse.

577
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,940
I fear that a lot of people actually think

578
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,980
they can do a lot of things without God.

579
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
I really do.

580
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,380
But can I tell you this evening,

581
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,660
it's only by God's grace

582
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
that you can even take your next breath.

583
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,720
Only by his grace you can take your next breath.

584
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,180
Our God is gracious, our God is a good God.

585
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,860
He went about doing good.

586
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,580
So what is Paul saying in verse 15

587
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,460
of 1 Thessalonians chapter number five?

588
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,260
Well, we must die to self.

589
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,820
It's absolutely imperative that we're filled

590
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,060
with the spirit of God, that we do as Paul said,

591
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,140
I am crucified with Christ, I die daily,

592
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,060
so that we might walk in the spirit

593
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,780
because I cannot do the work

594
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,180
that God has called me to do in my own flesh.

595
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,580
It's not natural.

596
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
And so he says we're to be like Christ,

597
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,460
we're to be like Jesus.

598
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,940
He left us an example, according to 1 Peter 2,

599
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,480
that we should follow his steps.

600
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
And those that named the name of Christ

601
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,120
were to be different, were to behave differently.

602
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
People were able to see our lives

603
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,760
and to see how we live,

604
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,600
to see that we can overcome evil with good.

605
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,360
I often, as I think about this truth

606
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
in 1 Thessalonians five and verse 15,

607
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,480
and also there in Romans chapter 12,

608
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
I often think about David

609
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,040
as David was being continually hunted by Saul.

610
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,480
And Saul, the Bible says, made David his enemy continually.

611
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,640
There were opportunities that David had

612
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,800
where he could have taken the life of Saul.

613
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,720
Saul. There are opportunities that David had where actually others said they would take

614
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:16,680
the life of Saul. And David says, I'm going to leave it in God's hands. His day will

615
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:25,760
come that he goes into battle. Did that happen? Absolutely. And guess what? David didn't

616
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,540
have any blood on his hands. Because David took that high road. David's not perfect.

617
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:39,320
But I think about David in the context of this. Because though Saul made David his enemy

618
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:47,760
continually, David never really looked at Saul as being his enemy. He said, who have

619
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,440
you come out to fight? A dead dog? What's he saying? Like, I'm not going to fight you.

620
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm not going to take your life. And when he did cut off part of the garment of Saul,

621
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:08,000
after he calls and shows that he could have taken his heart, he was convicted over that.

622
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,680
What a great picture for us tonight. And so we're to see that no man render evil for evil

623
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:23,120
to any man. We're to ever follow after that which is good. Not only among ourselves, but

624
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,320
to all men. Principle of grace and a pursuit of good. Really, boil it all down, it's just

625
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,720
to be like Jesus. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You

626
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,720
for Your many blessings. Thank You for the instruction that You give us. And Lord, I

627
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,840
pray that in the simplicity of the instruction, as far as understanding it, Lord, that we'd

628
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,720
apply it. That we would determine that we will live like Christ. Understanding that

629
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,800
we cannot do it in our own power. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. The

630
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,440
Spirit in the flesh there at enmity one with the other. And so God, I pray that You'd help

631
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,720
us to abide in You. I pray, God, that You'd help us to walk in the Spirit. Help us to

632
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:22,200
live as Christians. To live like Jesus. To follow the example that was left for us. When

633
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:29,480
He was reviled, He reviled not again. Lord, help us to overcome evil with good. I pray

634
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,800
that You'd bless our time of prayer. We thank You for the privilege. I pray that You'd work

635
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,820
in a distinct way. We'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Anyone need

636
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,760
a prayer bulletin tonight? You did not get one on your way in? Anyone need one?
