00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Kimberly, they'll be leaving bright and early.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.720
Actually, it'll be dark when you leave tomorrow morning,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.280
but we use the expression bright and early.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.359
Their flight leaves real early tomorrow morning,

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.000
so you pray for them.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.960
Of course, as we've mentioned several times

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.239
here in the last week, brother Sommerdorf's dad,

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.360
so Kimberly's grandfather,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.079
went home to be with the Lord last week,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.079
and so the funeral is on Friday,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.600
and so if you would pray for the Sommerdorf family.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.399
My great aunt passed away yesterday,

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.559
and I got the information today,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.600
and I was told that for years, unknown to me,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.720
for years, she has said that she wants me

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.639
to preach her funeral, and I found that out today.

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.560
I found out she died yesterday, and I found out today,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.040
and so I'm assuming on Saturday,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.860
I'm gonna be making a trip up to New Jersey

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.560
to preach a funeral for my great aunt,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.360
and if you would pray for that, I would appreciate it,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.720
and we got a number of family members that are not saved,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.360
a number of family members that come together for funerals,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.119
as perhaps many of you have that same situation,

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.040
and I'll preach the gospel.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.159
She was a lady that I believe,

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.479
through conversation with her,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.919
she knew the Lord as her Savior,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:05.760
so we're thankful for that,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.319
but I know we have a lot of family members

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.040
that do not know the Lord as their Savior,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.360
and so we certainly would appreciate your prayers

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360
with regard to that.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.680
First Thessalonians chapter number five this evening.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.440
First Thessalonians chapter number five,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.440
and be looking at verse number 15.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.800
Of course, over the last several weeks,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.879
this is actually lesson number eight,

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:28.040
as we have studied through this very concise,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.639
yet applicable instruction that God gives

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.000
to the church at Thessalonica

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760
at the end of this particular letter.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.000
Again, the end of chapter number three of the second letter,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.300
we find another list of bullet point instruction,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.139
if you will, and we've gone through each Wednesday evening

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.940
looking at these pieces of instruction

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.279
as we've sought to be able to apply

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:52.599
this truth in our lives.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.519
The Christian life, we know,

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:58.279
must be lived through the power of the Holy Spirit.

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.400
You try to live the Christian life in your own flesh,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.559
your own power, it's gonna be frustrating,

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:07.080
and this is the truth that God did not design

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600
that we would live the Christian life

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.919
in our own flesh, in our own power.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.160
Remember, Jesus said in John 15,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.820
without me, ye can do nothing,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.559
and it's very interesting how often we find in the scriptures

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.080
that God instructs us to not do certain things

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.080
that would be natural to do in our flesh,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.679
and so he instructs us not to do those things,

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.119
and then there are things that God instructs us to do

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.039
that naturally we don't wanna do in our flesh,

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.160
and why do we find those instructions?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.139
Well, because God says this is what pleases me,

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.360
and so he instructs us accordingly,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.880
and then we understand that we must live in dependence

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.440
on the Lord and the power of the Holy Spirit

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.600
in order to do the work that God has called us to do.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.039
We must die to self, we must walk in the Spirit.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.779
It is imperative that we are emptied of self

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.419
so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit of God.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.580
You're not gonna be, we understand the truth,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.279
the teaching that we are indwelled with the Spirit of God

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.880
at the moment of salvation,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.960
but understand, though we received all of the Holy Spirit

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.479
at the moment of salvation that we'll ever have,

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.080
the reality is that he doesn't have all of you

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.080
or all of me on any given day,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.600
and so we must yield ourselves,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.119
we must be dead to self, emptied of self

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.559
so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.559
We find here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 15,

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.279
notice the Bible says this.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240
See that none render evil for evil unto any man,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.080
but ever follow that which is good,

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.520
both among yourselves and to all men.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.300
Hold your place here and turn to the book of Romans,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.279
if you will, Romans chapter 12.

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:53.839
I wanna take a look at the instruction

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.320
that is given here in Romans chapter number 12

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.880
that really is a sister passage of scripture

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.759
with what we've just read in 1 Thessalonians 5.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.880
Notice in Romans 12, beginning in verse number 17,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.660
notice what the Bible says.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.600
Recompense to no man evil for evil.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.100
Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.239
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.720
live peaceably with all men.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.839
Notice 19, dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.799
but rather give place unto wrath,

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:25.519
for it is written, vengeance is mine,

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.839
I will repay, saith the Lord.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:31.440
Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.600
If he thirst, give him drink.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600
For in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:42.299
Verse 21, be not overcome of evil,

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:45.480
but overcome evil with good.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.320
This is not natural.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.880
It's not natural for your flesh or for my flesh,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.959
but we find that the Lord gives us this instruction,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.160
and as he gives us this instruction,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.359
it reveals to us how desperately we need the Lord

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:03.440
in order to fulfill the instruction that he's provided.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.579
Notice with me, I wanna mention two portions

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.119
of scripture principles, if you will,

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:09.519
from the book of Proverbs,

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.079
and then we'll get back to 1 Thessalonians chapter five.

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.799
Turn over very quickly, if you will, to Proverbs 24,

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:17.760
and look at verse number 29 with me,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.760
Proverbs 24 and verse number 29.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.299
The Bible says here, say not, I will do so to him

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:28.200
as he hath done to me.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.579
I will render to the man according to his work.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:35.920
You find in chapter 25, maybe on the same page there

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.239
as Proverbs 24, verse 29, but in chapter 25

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:41.959
and verse number 21, notice what the Bible says.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.200
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.000
and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.600
Does it sound like Romans chapter 12?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.160
We just read it a moment ago.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.480
Sounds awfully similar.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.480
Verse 22, for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.679
and the Lord shall reward thee.

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.959
As we look at these portions of scripture

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.760
and turn back to 1 Thessalonians chapter five,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.320
and we find that God is giving this instruction

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.399
to this local church, and he says,

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:15.339
see that none render evil for evil unto any man,

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.040
but ever follow that which is good,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.480
both among yourselves and to all men.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.799
No doubt in our lives, and maybe you experience this

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:26.399
personally before you trust that Christ is your Savior,

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:29.119
and we see it as we live life,

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:31.200
there are people that have the idea,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.839
I'll do good to you as long as you do good to me,

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.760
and if you do evil to me, I'll do evil to you,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.200
and it's kind of like that situation.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.339
That's not how God has instructed believers to live,

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:46.119
and we find in this portion of scripture,

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:48.040
I'm gonna use a title from the verse

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.600
over in Romans chapter number 12, verse 21,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.279
the title overcome evil with good.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.880
Overcome evil with good.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.320
I notice two principles here,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.200
really we're gonna look at these tonight,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.519
and I hope that as we make application

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.119
that we'd be challenged in our walk with the Lord,

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.679
remember the title for this entire series

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:10.959
is Walk Worthy, Please God,

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.880
and so we notice number one, if you're taking notes,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.760
a principle of grace, a principle of grace.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.760
He says, see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.279
No doubt the people, the church members

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.839
of the church at Thessalonica,

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:29.000
as they interacted with people in the society,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.320
we've already talked about the way

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.880
in which they suffered persecution,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.160
and they were dealing with all sorts of things,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.959
and no doubt they had interactions with people

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:41.640
where people treated them wrong.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.359
And here, the Lord, the Holy Spirit of God

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:45.559
is the author of scripture.

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:48.920
He says, see that none render evil for evil,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.320
notice, unto any man.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.760
We find that the word see is an interesting word

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.600
for it really carries with it the idea

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.579
in this particular context of looking

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:59.959
at this verse of scripture is take heed.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:03.279
In fact, the same Greek word is translated take heed

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.279
in Matthew 18 in verse number 10.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.480
We're not gonna turn over there.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.839
It's a different, it doesn't have anything to do

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.820
with this lesson this evening,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.440
but we see that the word is translated that way.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.279
And so the idea as we look at verse 15,

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.279
why is it that we need to be careful?

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.760
Why is it that we need to take heed?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.279
Well, I believe the reason is because your flesh

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.760
desires to react in a certain way.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.559
And my flesh desires to react in a certain way.

00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:34.719
Someone said this as I was considering

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:35.919
and looking through things here.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.320
It says if somebody punches you,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.280
the first thing you wanna do is punch them back.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.039
Right, we all can relate and understand that.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.960
And so we need to take heed.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.520
We need to, as it says here,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.200
see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.820
Your flesh has a desire to react in situations

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.239
in a certain way.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.960
And we find that as we look at this portion of Scripture

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.580
and with God's help, we can be gracious.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.440
Again, it's a principle of grace,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.440
and we can respond as opposed to reacting.

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:09.880
And see, there's always a situation

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.320
when you deal with things in life,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.000
when I deal with things in life,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.719
are we reacting to that thing

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.000
or are we responding to that thing?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.840
There's a difference between reacting and responding.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.280
And we find this evening that here,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.039
this principle of grace where he says,

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:28.700
see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.940
We are to be gracious.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.340
In fact, we find that even in our speech,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.020
Paul encourages the believers in Colossae

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.659
that they're to let their speech be,

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.500
what, it's supposed to be gracious,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.580
seasoned with salt, right?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.900
He says in Colossians 4 and verse number six,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.679
let your speech be always with grace.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:50.159
If we'd examine our speech,

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:53.219
if we would listen to the things that we say,

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:55.679
no doubt there are times in which our speech

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.679
is not always with grace.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.080
And we're to be gracious.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.600
I've heard people say I want to give him a piece of my mind and I'll jokingly respond

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.720
make sure it's not the last piece.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.480
And the reality is that we need to always, as he says in Colossians 4 and verse 6, speak

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.620
with grace.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:22.760
Let me say this tonight, to be gracious is to be like Jesus.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.560
To overcome evil with good is to be like the Lord.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.320
Do you remember what Jesus endured when he was going to the cross of Calvary?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.200
Do you remember all that he suffered?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.820
And yes we understand as he suffered and he bled and died he was paying for our sin but

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.840
we understand that as he was reviled he reviled not again.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.960
We find that the Lord Jesus Christ he said this, Father forgive them for they know not

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960
what they do.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.640
Can you imagine the grace?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.160
We understand that our God is gracious and as his people we too are to be gracious.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.200
Look over if you will to 1 Peter chapter number 2, I referenced a portion of one of the verses

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.680
here that we're going to look at in 1 Peter chapter number 2.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.080
But notice with me beginning in verse number 21 as we think about this principle of grace,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.760
this principle of grace.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.120
You know God's people are to be gracious people.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.600
I'm thankful that we serve a gracious God and that we have received grace and then we

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.800
too are to give grace, we're to be gracious.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:36.740
In 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, notice what the Bible says, for even here unto were ye called.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.280
Because Christ also suffered for us.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.920
Notice what it says, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.360
Now if it ended there we could say yes as we examine the life of Christ we understand

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.480
that he left us an example, there's so many things we could study within the life of Christ

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.240
and say what an example that is to us.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.480
But we find that the Holy Spirit of God in this portion of scripture zeroes into something

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.000
specifically with regard to the example that he's speaking of.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.560
Notice in verse 22, who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.480
We understand the just for the unjust as he'll say in chapter number 3.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:29.600
We find that it says this in verse 23, who when he was reviled, reviled not again.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:40.400
When he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.780
You know so often if we're not careful as we live in this world and we deal with individuals

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.980
and we have interactions and we deal with hardships and difficulties, we can be tempted

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:57.520
to respond in the flesh because we want to get even, we want to get back this idea maybe

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.260
if you could look at this portion of scripture with the thought of one that would be seeking

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.180
revenge.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:10.540
And yet we find that the Holy Spirit of God so often as he's speaking to his people in

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.020
the New Testament, as he's giving us the word of God, he's writing to us and he's giving

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.900
us instruction that at the face value we look at it and say how in the world could

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.900
I do this?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.380
Well you can't apart from the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.860
And Christians are to be different.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.740
You know I think that's one of the problems that we have in America today is that so many

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.100
Christians have, Christians quote unquote because probably a lot of them aren't even

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:42.520
saved people, but they've so assimilated to the world and they want to be accepted by

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.680
the world, they don't want to ruffle any feathers so to speak, that there's no difference.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.880
They don't see any difference in our behavior.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.080
I was sent some email or I was sent some videos and I saw them and I talked to a pastor friend

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.400
about one of them yesterday, but I was given some videos of some quote unquote churches

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.200
in America that a couple of weeks ago on Super Bowl Sunday, some of the things that happened

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.800
in their churches in the name of Christianity, it was absolutely appalling.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.920
It was blasphemous.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:21.360
They were literally kicking a Bible on the platform like it was a football.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.400
That's unbelievable to me.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.200
We're called to be different.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.720
What did Jesus say in Matthew 5?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.800
Look if you do good to those that do good to you, like even the publicans do that.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.040
Publicans are to be different.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:45.320
And so he says, see that none render evil for evil unto any man.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.400
You want to see just how alive your flesh is?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.160
Let somebody treat you wrong, amen?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:01.240
And you're going to find out in a hurry how alive that old man can be revived, amen?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.600
You let somebody treat you wrong and it's amazing.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.720
You can, I'm telling you, I've experienced, you can be walking in the spirit, you can

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.200
be singing the sweet songs from our hymnal and just rejoicing in the Lord, and then somebody

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.640
does something and man that old man is just like, bam.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.840
I mean he's alive and well, but we're to crucify him.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.960
We cannot do this in our own power.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.080
The instruction that we find is instruction that helps us recognize how desperately we

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.100
need the Lord.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.880
He said, and we'll look at it in John 15, we'll look at the two verses at the end, but

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.160
without me you can do nothing.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.680
Notice a principle of grace, notice number two as we look at the remainder of the verse

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.520
of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 15, a pursuit of good.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:58.280
A pursuit of good, notice what he says, but ever follow that, which is good, literally

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.040
the idea of follow that is pursuing after, and so he says, but ever follow that which

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040
is good.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.680
Then he says this, both among yourselves, remember who's he writing to, he's writing

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:17.080
to the church at Thessalonica, so among yourselves, but then notice he says, and to all men.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.360
And so we are to be doing good, not only doing good, but pursuing good.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:28.680
The word good, it carries with it that idea of that which is upright, that which is honorable.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.640
How do we determine what is good?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.200
Is it for your determination?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200
Am I the standard?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.680
No, God is the standard.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.560
And when we understand that we're pursuing and we're seeking to do that which is right,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.480
that which is upright and honorable, that which is pleasing to God, he says that we're

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.600
to do good, we're to follow after, but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.200
and to all men.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.200
Looking, again, not only doing what's good, but pursuing good.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.280
And notice he says, not only among yourselves, but to all men.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.000
So we see this principle of grace that we find at the beginning of chapter 5 and verse

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.160
number 15, see that none render evil for evil unto any man, but then we see this pursuit

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.000
of good, and we understand, remember the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly ministry,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.760
one man comes to him and calls him good.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.560
He says, why callest thou me good?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.760
And we find this evening that we live in a society where they call evil good and good

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760
evil.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.760
We understand that.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.360
The prophets speak of that, and no doubt we live in that situation.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.140
I had to be on the phone today with someone from Fairfax County, and I said, so and so,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.280
with all due respect, I want to make a comment that I do not want you to respond to, because

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.680
I wasn't trying to get them in trouble.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.280
But what they were telling me was absolutely ludicrous.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.240
And I said, what you're telling me is you're violating our constitutional rights to live

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.440
out our faith.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
It's bizarre.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.920
But we're to do good.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.320
We're to do good.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.080
God determines what is good.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.520
We live in a society that is upside down.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.680
I mean, they don't have the right moral code.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.840
And we find that as we go to God's Word, we can't be influenced by the society, by the

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
culture.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.640
We can't say, well, everyone else is doing it.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.240
You ever hear somebody say that?

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240
Your kids want to do something, and you say, well, why do you want to do that?

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.720
Well, everyone else is doing it.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:34.440
I remember with our children, because it was said to me, they said, well, if, my parents

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.160
said, if your brother jumps off a bridge, are you going to jump off a bridge?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.080
I don't know if any of you heard that when you were growing up or said that to your children.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.600
So, I said that to Joseph one day, and he says, with all sincerity, he says, yes.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.600
And I said, Joseph, if your sister jumps off the bridge, are you going to jump off the

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600
bridge too?

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600
And he's like, yes.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.760
I said, bud, did you understand the question?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.239
He says, yes.

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:04.320
She's going to need help, so I'm going to try to help her.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.119
And I thought, well, that just fell apart on me.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.440
I mean, it's just terrible, right?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.080
Like, what do you say?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.080
But we notice when God says that we're to pursue that which is good ever, but ever follow

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.960
that which is good, don't allow the society in which we're living where everyone else

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.360
is doing it, and it just seems to be accepted.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.040
Maybe even people within churches, those that call themselves believers and Christians,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.679
they're doing these things and say, well, I guess it's okay.

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:33.679
No, no.

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:37.119
We need to go to God and figure out what's good.

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:38.720
Live accordingly.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.840
I said this, to be gracious is to be like Jesus.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.679
Let me say this, to do good is to be like Jesus.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:52.760
Notice in Acts chapter 10, if you will, in Acts chapter number 10, we find that we pick

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:59.200
ourselves up in this portion of Scripture where Peter is preaching.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.160
Why is he preaching?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.160
Well, because Cornelius had a vision,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.300
and in that vision, Cornelius is told to send for Peter,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.800
and Peter at the same time is having that vision, right?

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.700
He's hungry and he has this vision,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.700
and God instructs him to go with these

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.980
that would come to the house, and we find that he does,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.640
and as he finds himself there,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.540
the Bible tells us, as they enter in Caesarea

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.280
in verse number 24, that Cornelius waited for them

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.720
and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.040
I mean, this is an awesome opportunity.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.780
Cornelius is gonna hear, listen,

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.580
the angel could not tell Cornelius how to be saved.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.980
All the angel could do was tell Cornelius

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:45.000
where he had to go in order to get the true message,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
and so Peter comes, and we find that as he arrives,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
there's this crowd here that's gathered,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.940
and the introduction has gone on.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.460
Notice, if you will, pick it up with me

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.120
in verse number 33, immediately therefore I sent to thee,

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.660
this is Cornelius speaking,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.200
and thou hast well done that thou art come.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.360
He's talking to Peter.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360
He says at the end of verse 33,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.160
now therefore are we all here present before God

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.700
to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.340
Then Peter opened his mouth.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.440
What an easy sermon to preach.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.380
I mean, honestly, Cornelius has done all the work

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.740
to gather all the people and said,

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.580
we're here to hear what you have to say,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.500
and he opens his mouth and begins to preach,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.740
and what does he begin to preach?

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.200
He begins to preach about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.780
By the way, that's our message, preaching Christ.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.380
Amen?

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.580
We find that he says this.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.220
Notice, I'm gonna jump right in the middle of his message.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.760
He then gets into the death, burial, and resurrection,

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.220
but notice in verse 38,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.220
a pursuit of good is our thought

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.020
from 1 Thessalonians 5, 15.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.260
I said to do good is to be like Jesus.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.940
Notice in verse 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.800
with the Holy Ghost and with power

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.640
who went about doing good

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.600
and healing all that were oppressed of the devil,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.340
for God was with him, and we are witnesses of all things,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.940
which he did both in the land of the Jews

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.340
and in Jerusalem, who they slew

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.420
and hanged on a tree.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.920
Him, God raised up the third day and showed him openly,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.720
and so we see that he preaches the gospel,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.480
but notice in verse 38, he says,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.880
who went about doing good.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.260
Who went about doing good.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.320
The instruction there in 1 Thessalonians

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.720
is that we're to ever follow that which is good,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.160
that we're to be pursuing good.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.900
You're only gonna determine what is good

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.460
as you dig into God's word and you decide

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.100
that God will have the authority and the standard

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.500
for determining what is good and right,

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.340
that which is upright and honorable.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.240
How is it that we're to live,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.540
and what is it that we're to do

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.700
in this perverse generation in which we live?

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.620
We live in a crooked and perverse generation.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.080
Paul said that to the believers in Philippi.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.420
And so we find that we live in that situation,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.620
but we're to shine as lights in a dark place,

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.960
and that's what we're to do.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.660
And so we find that here, Paul is giving this instruction

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.300
of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.860
to the church at Thessalonica,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.700
and he says there's this principle of grace

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.600
and there's this pursuit of good,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.140
and we find that in both of those truths

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.640
that are given in verse 15 of chapter five,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.400
that really what Paul is saying

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.880
to the believers in Thessalonica

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.960
and what God is saying to us tonight

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.600
is that we're to be like Jesus.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.520
That's not what Christians are supposed to be.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.760
Why were they first called Christians in Antioch?

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.160
Well, because they were like Christ.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.080
And we find that we as Christians,

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.560
someone said this, I like your Christ,

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.880
but I don't like your Christians.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.240
He went on to say this,

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.260
the reason why he made that statement

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:47.260
is because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.980
Now that's a heavy indictment, is it not?

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.340
He said, I like your Christ, but not your Christians.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.180
Why?

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.140
Because your Christians are nothing like your Christ.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.280
We've lost our way, we've lost our identity.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.020
If we're standing up on a platform,

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.460
kicking a Bible around,

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.580
and that would never happen here, I understand that,

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.900
and I think for all of us that are here this evening,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.140
that if you found yourself in a church like that

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.900
on a Sunday morning by accident,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.020
I hope you would get up and walk out, amen?

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.900
But the reality is that there are,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.780
this is happening all around America.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.140
It's sickening.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.060
You know, it's interesting, C.H. Spurgeon said this,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.420
and C.H. Spurgeon, I don't know, 150 years ago roughly,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.700
somewhere in that ballpark,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.620
and so C.H. Spurgeon said this,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.900
what's happening too often,

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.380
it was a downgrade controversy,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.280
you can read about it, all this stuff that's going on,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.780
but he made this statement, he wrote an article about it,

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.020
really a great statement,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.940
and once thought what was happening,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.120
he said, the church is entertaining the goats.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.660
If it was true then, oh, how it's become true today.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.120
And you know, there are these churches that think,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.620
well, we have a big crowd.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.700
So what?

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.660
It's not about the number of people.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.520
It's about, listen, God is the one

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.500
that determines how we worship, amen?

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.260
Not everything that's called worship today is worship.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.860
He said you're to worship me in spirit and in truth.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.700
And he is a holy, reverent God.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.660
What happened when the boys tried to offer

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.820
some strange fire in the Old Testament?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.660
They died.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.140
What happened when they decided

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.780
they were gonna move the ark on the cart

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.020
and Uzzah's gonna hold it?

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.860
What happens?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.660
He dies, right?

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.740
We serve a holy God.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.300
We have to enter into his presence accordingly.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.860
And so what Paul is saying is that we're to live like Jesus.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.900
We're to be like Jesus.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.580
Because to be gracious is to be like our Savior.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.740
To do good is to be like our Savior.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.380
And so look in John chapter 15.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.660
I said we'd finish here and I want you to notice.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.880
We're gonna read five verses

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.960
and then we'll be done this evening.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.500
We'll get into our prayer time.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.740
In John 15 and verse number one,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.800
no doubt you're familiar with the portion of Scripture,

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.400
but I think it's important that we read it

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.840
and we get it just solidified in our minds

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.000
once again this evening.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.120
Jesus says, I am the true vine.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.480
My father's the husbandman.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.200
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200
he taketh away.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.720
And every branch that beareth fruit,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.420
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.160
Now you're clean through the word

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.360
which I have spoken unto you.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.940
Abide in me and I in you.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.240
Notice that the branch cannot bear fruit of itself

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.440
except it abide in the vine.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.580
No more can he except you abide in me.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.160
We understand this from a physical perspective.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.600
How many of you, well, I don't wanna have you

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.560
raise your hands because maybe you get in trouble,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.560
but some people probably bought flowers

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.460
for their spouse on Valentine's Day.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.800
And you bought those flowers

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.920
and man, they were probably beautiful

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.240
when you picked them up and you took them home

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240
and they looked real nice.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.780
But today, a week later, they probably don't look as nice.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.460
Maybe you've already had to throw them out.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.720
Maybe you got them from somewhere

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720
where they just didn't last

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.400
as long as you'd hoped that they'd last.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.640
Why is it that they die?

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.000
Why do the petals fall off?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.840
Why do they droop over and turn colors?

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.400
Well, because they've been severed, right?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.000
They've been cut from the source,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.120
the vine that gives them life.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.440
So you can change the water, you can put the food in,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.280
you can do all the stuff that you wanna do,

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.280
but it's gonna just be short-lived.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.420
So Jesus uses this illustration,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.420
it'll be very easy for people to understand and relate to,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.820
and he says in verse number five,

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.560
I am the vine, ye are the branches.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.000
By the way, it's a good thing for us

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.040
to recognize and remember our place.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.240
We are not the vine, he is the vine.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.600
Sometimes we think we're the ones

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.000
that are in control of my life, I'm gonna do,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.020
no, no, we're just the branch, he is the vine.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.580
He is the vine, and he says this,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.500
he that abideth in me and I in him,

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.260
the same bringeth forth much fruit,

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.180
for without me ye can do nothing.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.060
You know what I fear?

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.060
I fear that a lot of people really don't believe that verse.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.940
I fear that a lot of people actually think

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.980
they can do a lot of things without God.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.240
I really do.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.380
But can I tell you this evening,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.660
it's only by God's grace

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.660
that you can even take your next breath.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.720
Only by his grace you can take your next breath.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.180
Our God is gracious, our God is a good God.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.860
He went about doing good.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.580
So what is Paul saying in verse 15

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.460
of 1 Thessalonians chapter number five?

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.260
Well, we must die to self.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.820
It's absolutely imperative that we're filled

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.060
with the spirit of God, that we do as Paul said,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.140
I am crucified with Christ, I die daily,

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.060
so that we might walk in the spirit

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.780
because I cannot do the work

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.180
that God has called me to do in my own flesh.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.580
It's not natural.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.620
And so he says we're to be like Christ,

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.460
we're to be like Jesus.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.940
He left us an example, according to 1 Peter 2,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.480
that we should follow his steps.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.400
And those that named the name of Christ

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.120
were to be different, were to behave differently.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.120
People were able to see our lives

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.760
and to see how we live,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.600
to see that we can overcome evil with good.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.360
I often, as I think about this truth

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.200
in 1 Thessalonians five and verse 15,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.480
and also there in Romans chapter 12,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.080
I often think about David

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.040
as David was being continually hunted by Saul.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.480
And Saul, the Bible says, made David his enemy continually.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.640
There were opportunities that David had

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.800
where he could have taken the life of Saul.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.720
Saul. There are opportunities that David had where actually others said they would take

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:16.680
the life of Saul. And David says, I'm going to leave it in God's hands. His day will

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:25.760
come that he goes into battle. Did that happen? Absolutely. And guess what? David didn't

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.540
have any blood on his hands. Because David took that high road. David's not perfect.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:39.320
But I think about David in the context of this. Because though Saul made David his enemy

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:47.760
continually, David never really looked at Saul as being his enemy. He said, who have

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:53.440
you come out to fight? A dead dog? What's he saying? Like, I'm not going to fight you.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.600
I'm not going to take your life. And when he did cut off part of the garment of Saul,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:08.000
after he calls and shows that he could have taken his heart, he was convicted over that.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.680
What a great picture for us tonight. And so we're to see that no man render evil for evil

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:23.120
to any man. We're to ever follow after that which is good. Not only among ourselves, but

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:30.320
to all men. Principle of grace and a pursuit of good. Really, boil it all down, it's just

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.720
to be like Jesus. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.720
for Your many blessings. Thank You for the instruction that You give us. And Lord, I

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:47.840
pray that in the simplicity of the instruction, as far as understanding it, Lord, that we'd

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:54.720
apply it. That we would determine that we will live like Christ. Understanding that

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:01.800
we cannot do it in our own power. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit of God. The

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.440
Spirit in the flesh there at enmity one with the other. And so God, I pray that You'd help

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.720
us to abide in You. I pray, God, that You'd help us to walk in the Spirit. Help us to

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:22.200
live as Christians. To live like Jesus. To follow the example that was left for us. When

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.480
He was reviled, He reviled not again. Lord, help us to overcome evil with good. I pray

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.800
that You'd bless our time of prayer. We thank You for the privilege. I pray that You'd work

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.820
in a distinct way. We'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Anyone need

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.760
a prayer bulletin tonight? You did not get one on your way in? Anyone need one?
