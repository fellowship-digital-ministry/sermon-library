1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
this morning that I'll be preaching from this passage of Scripture. And this, as far as I am

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,279
aware, this will be the final message that I'll preach here in 2020. I'll give a thought on

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,319
Wednesday evening during our Christmas service, but I won't be preaching a full message. We'll

4
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:20,000
have a number of other things going on. I do encourage you to be here. I'm sure it will be

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,639
a blessing to you on Wednesday evening, our Christmas service. But this evening, as we look

6
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:30,959
at this portion of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 23. And as we look

7
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:36,720
at the passage of Scripture, I am mindful of what the psalmist declared. And I want to read to you

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,080
a text of Scripture from the book of Psalms. You stay here in 1 Samuel 14. I'm just going to read

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,200
it and then use it as a springboard to come back to our passage here. But in Psalm 119, in verse

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:57,439
126, the psalmist declared, it is time for thee, Lord, to work. For they have made void thy law.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,040
I understand that at the time of the event that we'll look at this evening in 1 Samuel 14, at the

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,639
time of this event, Psalm 119 had not yet been written. I understand that Jonathan could not go

13
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:18,239
to the book of Psalms and read Psalm 119 and verse number 126. But as we look at this passage

14
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,239
of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, no doubt there was an understanding to the circumstances in which

15
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,800
they were facing and the need for God to work. I believe that throughout the history of mankind,

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,919
that as we have had the verse of Scripture in Psalm 119 and verse 126, that many times

17
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:46,080
this verse has been quoted, many times men of God and people of God have pleaded with God

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,519
to work. And I'm thankful that God is able to work. I'm thankful that God is working.

19
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,879
I am thankful that God is always at work. The reality is that there are times in our lives

20
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,599
when we do not see exactly how the Lord is working. And perhaps it is some point down the future

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,639
that we can look back at the events and we can say, that's how God was working.

22
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,000
That's what God was doing. That's what God was orchestrating. And at the very moment as we're

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,199
living life, as we're going through the events, maybe we don't really see what God is doing or

24
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,880
how God is working, but we can rest in the fact that God is working. I also consider the words

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:32,080
of the psalmist in Psalm 109, verses 26 and 27, when the psalmist said this, help me, O Lord my God.

26
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:40,559
O save me according to thy mercy. Notice that they may know that this is thy hand,

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,080
that thou Lord has done it. I believe that we would echo the words of the psalmist in Psalm

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,199
119 and verse 126. It is time for thee Lord to work for they have made void thy law. But I long

29
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:01,199
to see God work in such a manner as what the psalmist declares in Psalm 109, verses 26 and 27,

30
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,800
that it would be absolutely clear, abundantly known that it was God that worked. That it is

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,800
not man that has orchestrated some things, that it's not just our scheme and our plan. Know that

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,119
God has worked. As we look at the passage of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, we read this event in

33
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:27,279
the life of Jonathan, and I want to draw your attention to verse number six. I'll begin in

34
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,399
verse number one as we get into the message, but notice in verse number six, I'll give you the

35
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,559
title and we'll get going. The Bible says, and Jonathan said to the young man that bear his

36
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:42,960
armor, come and let us go over under the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the Lord

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:52,399
will work for us for there's no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. I've taken part

38
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:59,279
of this sixth verse of 1 Samuel 14 to use as our title this evening. It may be that the Lord will

39
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:05,279
work for us. It may be that the Lord will work for us. Notice if we dig into the passage in verses

40
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:10,320
one through seven, if you're taking notes this evening, number one, the expectation of Jonathan.

41
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,639
The Bible says in 1 Samuel 14 in verse number one, it says, now it came to pass upon a day

42
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,640
that Jonathan, the son of Saul said unto the young man that bear his armor, come and let us go over

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,239
the Philistines garrison that is on the other side, but he told not his father. Now who's Jonathan's

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,519
father? Saul, the king of Israel. And we find that Jonathan is there and this young man, his armor

45
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,000
bearer, we do not know his name at this point. We find that Jonathan is there and he's in this

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,480
situation and he says to this man, it's interesting that it says that it came upon a day. And Jonathan

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Saul's son, the son of the king, he says to his armor bearer, come and let us go over to the

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,679
Philistines garrison that is on the other side. Now in the next few verses of scripture, really in

49
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,359
verses two through five, it's almost like a parenthetical where God is helping us to understand

50
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:07,040
the scene, that he's setting for us the scene, the backdrop for what is happening in Israel during

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,200
this particular time. The Bible says in verse number two, and Saul tarried in the uttermost

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,279
part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree, which is in Migron. And the people that were with him

53
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,799
were about 600 men. Now keep in mind that Saul is the king and he is the king and he's there and

54
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:31,679
he's under this pomegranate tree in this particular area. It's in Migron according to verse number two

55
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:37,200
and with him are about 600 men. It continues in verse number three and tells us that Ahiah,

56
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,040
the son of Ahitab, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest,

57
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,760
and Shiloh wearing an ephod. So he's there as well. And it says that the people knew not

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,359
that Jonathan was gone. And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over into the

59
00:05:55,359 --> 00:06:00,079
Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side.

60
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,480
And the name of the one was Boaz and the name of the other was Sina. The forefront of the one was

61
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,720
Situate northward and against Michmash and the other southward over against Gibeah. And so as

62
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,600
we look at verses two through five, we find that God is providing for us again, setting the scene

63
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,839
and helping us to understand what's going on. Saul is there. He's got all of these men with

64
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:28,480
them. And Jonathan says to his armor bearer, let us go over and let us go over to the Philistines'

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,279
garrison that is on the other side. The details that are provided in verses four and five with

66
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,119
regard to these sharp rocks, of course, this doesn't mean a whole lot to us if we've not

67
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:42,880
traveled and studied the geography. But we find that for the original recipients of this book,

68
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,480
as they would be reading about the history, they would have an understanding exactly of the layout

69
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,959
of where they were and what was going on. And as we find that God would give us that parenthetical

70
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,559
to help us see what's going on, I want you to keep in mind that Jonathan, as we look in verse

71
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:06,320
number one again in verse number six, that his expectation is clearly seen. In verse number six,

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,040
Jonathan then says to the young man that bear his armor, come and let us go over under the

73
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,320
garrison to these uncircumcised. Speaking of the Philistines, again, he says this, it may be that

74
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,799
the Lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. I believe

75
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:28,000
that as we look here in verse one, in verse number six, and we begin to see the expectation of

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Jonathan, I believe that he had confidence in the fact that God was able to work. I believe that

77
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,559
Jonathan was able to demonstrate to his armor bearer, not only his confidence, but his faith

78
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,920
that God was going to work. Why? Because the armor bearer is going to go with them.

79
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:50,559
And we find that at the end of verse number six, that Jonathan says this, there is no restraint to

80
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:57,760
the Lord to save by many or by few. Now you are mindful that Jonathan says to his armor bearer,

81
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,760
let us go over under the garrison of the Philistines. How many people are going?

82
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:09,119
Come on, this isn't hard. Two. Thank you. All right. Jonathan and his armor bearer, two.

83
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:18,079
Saul is back under the pomegranate tree with how many? 600. Right? That's kind of a big difference.

84
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,320
Right? But what's Jonathan saying? Listen, Saul's under there. He's over under the pomegranate tree.

85
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,399
There's this situation that's going on with the Philistines and all that's taking place.

86
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,119
And Jonathan says, I believe that God is able to do something. I believe that God is able to work.

87
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:38,080
And listen, it is, there's no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,479
God can work and God does work. And oftentimes he works in situations in which he alone would

89
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:50,640
be the one to receive the glory. He's going to use Jonathan and his armor bearer here in amazing way.

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,919
As we study through the passage of scripture, we're going to see what unfolds and we'll see

91
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:00,000
how God works and what God does. But we notice here that Jonathan, what is it that he was

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,440
expecting? I believe with all of my heart, as I read this passage of scripture, that he was expecting

93
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,000
God to work. He says, it may be that the Lord will work for us. I don't think that that's a

94
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:18,239
statement or a declaration of, well, it might happen kind of a situation. He's understanding

95
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:23,200
that God is able, as we mentioned already, as we looked at the Psalmist in Psalm 119, when he says

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,400
it is time for thee to work Lord, that we have seen throughout the history of mankind, that we

97
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,840
have experienced in our own lives, the work of God. And when God is engaged in doing a work, when God

98
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,479
is doing something and he's using his people, how he alone is glorified and we see the impact of God

99
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:49,679
working. And I believe this evening that Jonathan had every expectation that God was going to work.

100
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:56,000
And I wonder at the onset of the message this evening, do we as God's people in 2020,

101
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,840
are we expecting God to work? Are we expecting God?

102
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
to do something?

103
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,380
Are we looking to the Lord God Almighty,

104
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,220
Jehovah, El Shaddai?

105
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,260
Are we looking to Him to work?

106
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,020
To do something?

107
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,600
There are times in which we look at

108
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,260
the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

109
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,800
and during His life and ministry,

110
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,460
that short period of time

111
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,300
in which His public ministry is recounted for us

112
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,060
in the Gospel records,

113
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,400
we find that on a number of occasions,

114
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,860
that individuals came to the Lord Jesus Christ

115
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,640
asking Him to work.

116
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,720
Heal my son.

117
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,840
Heal my daughter.

118
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,180
Deal with my servant.

119
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,600
Help in this situation.

120
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,880
And this evening, we understand

121
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,600
that there is no restraint on God working

122
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,000
and on God saving by many or by few.

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,960
There are times in which we falsely

124
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
have come to the conclusion

125
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
or we have had the belief

126
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,560
that God needs this great number of people

127
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,840
in order to do something.

128
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,740
We sing the hymn.

129
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,780
It's not in our hymnal,

130
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
but we sing the hymn,

131
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,420
Little Is Much When God Is In It.

132
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,540
And I like that hymn.

133
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,620
I love that song.

134
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,900
What a powerful truth is contained

135
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,300
within the words of that wonderful hymn.

136
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,220
Little is much when God is in it.

137
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,180
And I believe that.

138
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,220
And here we find that Jonathan,

139
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,100
as we look at this passage,

140
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,980
we begin to see what he expected.

141
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,860
In v. 7, his armor bearer said unto him,

142
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,420
he responds to Jonathan,

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,260
it says,

144
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,000
Do all that is in thine heart, turn thee.

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,320
Again, no doubt that Jonathan was able

147
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,400
to have an influence upon his armor bearer.

148
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Again, as you look at the situation

149
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,800
and you look at all that's going on,

150
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,440
Saul over here with these 600 men,

151
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,520
the priest is there,

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,280
and Jonathan says to his armor bearer,

153
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,120
two of them, let us go over

154
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,480
unto the garrison of these Philistines.

155
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,700
And the armor bearer,

156
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,220
as he hears and understands what Jonathan is saying,

157
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,460
the armor bearer says,

158
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,340
Do all that is in thine heart, turn thee.

159
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

160
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,660
I'm thankful that the armor bearer

161
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,260
responded the way that he did.

162
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,720
Because he was going to have a great experience.

163
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,560
He could have said,

164
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,660
No, Jonathan, you know what?

165
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,860
You're going to fly solo tonight.

166
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm not interested in going.

167
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,260
But Jonathan influenced this armor bearer

168
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,480
to the point that the armor bearer agrees to go

169
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,720
and tells him that he would be with him.

170
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
Not only do we see the expectation,

171
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,660
I want you to notice the explanation of the plan.

172
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,480
In verses eight through 10,

173
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Jonathan is going to explain this plan to his armor bearer.

174
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,100
I would say this,

175
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,280
if I were to just kind of summarize these verses,

176
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,760
this is a declaration of his faith.

177
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,440
The Bible says that as he is going through this plan

178
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,200
and explaining it to the armor bearer,

179
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
really, it's a simple plan.

180
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,580
Jonathan said, notice in verse number eight,

181
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,660
then said, Jonathan, behold,

182
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,940
we will pass over unto these men

183
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,940
and we will discover ourselves unto them.

184
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
So in other words,

185
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,180
we're going to go and let them know that we're here.

186
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,180
Now I've never been in any kind of a covert operation.

187
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,860
I've never been in the armed forces,

188
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,060
but something about some of the strategy begins to say,

189
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,540
why are you going to make yourself known?

190
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,980
Because they're expecting God to work.

191
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,740
It wasn't based upon what they were going to do.

192
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,960
It was based upon what God was going to do

193
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
and how God was going to work.

194
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,520
And we notice that Jonathan says,

195
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,160
we're going to discover ourselves unto them.

196
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,720
And then we're going to wait for their response.

197
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
And how they respond is going to dictate what we do.

198
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
That's what he says.

199
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,200
Notice in verse number nine,

200
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,560
if they, these Philistines,

201
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
if they say unto us,

202
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,120
Terry, until we come to you,

203
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,640
then we will stand still in our place

204
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
and will not go up unto them.

205
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,880
So we're going to make ourselves known.

206
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,620
We're going to discover ourselves unto them.

207
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,660
And we're going to wait to see what they say.

208
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,460
And if they say, hey, you, Terry there,

209
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
we're going to come to you.

210
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,780
Then we're just going to stand still

211
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,100
and wait for them to come.

212
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,100
Verse number 10.

213
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,100
But if they say thus, come up unto us,

214
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,500
then we will go up for the Lord

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,880
hath delivered them into our hand.

216
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,660
And this shall be a sign unto us.

217
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,260
We find that Jonathan explains this very simple plan

218
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,440
to his armor bearer.

219
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
And we notice at the end of verse number 10,

220
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,340
that he says that this would be the sign

221
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,180
for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand.

222
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,540
And as soon as you come to verse number 11,

223
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,180
not, I mean, the explanation of the plan is pretty simple,

224
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,340
but now let's notice the execution of the plan

225
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,120
in verses 11 through 14.

226
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,700
As we make our way through the passage,

227
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
the Bible says in verse number 11,

228
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,560
and both of them, who's that?

229
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
That's Jonathan and the armor bearer.

230
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,620
They both discover themselves

231
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,680
under the garrison of the Philistines.

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,640
Now, can you imagine being there?

233
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,400
I mean, honestly, put yourself in a situation

234
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,720
and you're going to just go ahead and make yourself,

235
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,880
there's two of you,

236
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,000
and you're going to discover yourselves.

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,480
You're going to make yourself known

238
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,120
to this group of these Philistines.

239
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,820
The enemies, as we find,

240
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,220
as you look throughout the pages of 1 Samuel in particular,

241
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,540
you'll find a number of times in which

242
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,260
the nation of Israel is in battle against the Philistines.

243
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,340
And you find this continuing going on.

244
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,020
And you find that in verse number 11,

245
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,860
it says, and both of them discovered themselves

246
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,540
under the garrison of the Philistines.

247
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,780
Notice the Philistines said,

248
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,100
behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes

249
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,940
where they had hid themselves.

250
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,360
Now, why were they hiding?

251
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm assuming they were hiding in this passage

252
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,660
the same reason they were hiding in 1 Samuel 17.

253
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,980
We're very familiar with 1 Samuel 17

254
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,740
because it's in 1 Samuel 17 that we read

255
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,020
of when David slew Goliath.

256
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,660
We're very familiar with the passage of scripture

257
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,020
in 1 Samuel 17.

258
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,100
And we understand, again, as I mentioned,

259
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,460
that for this period of time in Israel's history,

260
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,580
there's a continual battle

261
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,780
between the Philistines and the children of Israel.

262
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,260
It's just an ongoing saga that happens over and over

263
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,800
and there's one side wins

264
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,860
and then they come back and so on and so forth.

265
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,260
And we find that in 1 Samuel 17,

266
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,580
the Bible tells us that they're all hiding, right?

267
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,860
The giant of the Philistines, Goliath,

268
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,020
he would come out and he would give his challenge.

269
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,780
And what was Saul and all the men of war,

270
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,620
what were they doing?

271
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,440
They were hiding.

272
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,220
And David comes and he hears what's declared

273
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,740
and he says, is there not a cause?

274
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,980
And we, of course, understand as we read

275
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,300
through the 17th chapter.

276
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,140
But here in chapter number 14,

277
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,460
we find that Jonathan and his armor bearer

278
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,200
discover themselves to these Philistines

279
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,720
and they say, behold, the Hebrews come forth

280
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,240
out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

281
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,320
The men of the garrison answered Jonathan

282
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,040
and his armor bearer and said, come up to us.

283
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,840
I think those were good words that they heard, amen?

284
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,760
I think that Jonathan and his armor bearer

285
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,260
as they heard these Philistines,

286
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,920
as they discovered themselves,

287
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,080
they made themselves known,

288
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,640
their selves known to these Philistines.

289
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,260
And the Philistines say in verse number 12,

290
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,420
come up to us.

291
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,620
And then they say this, and we will show you a thing.

292
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm not sure all that's meant within that statement.

293
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,220
I'm not sure of the talking trash,

294
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,220
if we could use that terminology of this particular era,

295
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,580
but they say, come up to us

296
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,980
and we're gonna show you a thing.

297
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,860
Little did they know that Jonathan and his armor bearer

298
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,820
were going in the power of God.

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,000
They had already, Jonathan had already declared

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,520
the fact that God was able to work.

301
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,720
He'd already had this expectation

302
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,360
that God was going to work.

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,360
His plan from a military perspective,

304
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,960
from a combat perspective,

305
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
if he sat in a room with a bunch of generals

306
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
and said, here's what we're gonna do.

307
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,680
We know that the enemy's over there

308
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,280
and we're gonna make ourselves known to the enemy.

309
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,600
We're gonna do what?

310
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Why would we do that?

311
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,180
Because we're expecting God to work.

312
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,780
And they say, come up to us

313
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,860
and we will show you a thing.

314
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,220
And Jonathan said unto his armor bearer,

315
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,140
and I think he said it with excitement,

316
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,140
come up after me, for the Lord hath delivered them

317
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,780
into the hands, excuse me, the hand of Israel.

318
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,059
As I mentioned that the explanation of the plan

319
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,980
would be that of maybe declaring faith,

320
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,400
I would say that the execution of the plan

321
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,280
would be exercising faith.

322
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,160
See, it's one thing to say,

323
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,080
I believe that God's going to work.

324
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,360
It's another thing to say, here's how God is able to work.

325
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,640
But then when do you actually discover yourself

326
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,540
to the Philistines, you understand?

327
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,320
That's that taking the step of faith.

328
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,340
That's the exercising faith.

329
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,760
That's saying, I'm not just gonna talk about it

330
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,180
in some kind of think tank, kind of a possible way,

331
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,240
hypothetical, it could, it couldn't.

332
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
No, I'm expecting God to work

333
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,020
and I'm going to exercise faith.

334
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,820
I'm gonna discover myself to these Philistines.

335
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,660
And the Bible tells us as we look here

336
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,720
at the passage of Scripture that once again,

337
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
that Jonathan would declare his confidence

338
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,880
in God's ability to work where the Bible says,

339
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,880
the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

340
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,580
At this particular time, there's not even been a skirmish.

341
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,660
The first person has not yet been slain.

342
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,100
But yet Jonathan understands that through this process

343
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,340
of time and through all that has taken place,

344
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,000
that this was the sign.

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Remember he says in verse number 10,

346
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,860
this shall be a sign unto us.

347
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
And the way in which things have unfolded

348
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
in the execution of the plan,

349
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,860
he has this great confidence that God would give them

350
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,980
And the victory, verse number 13, and Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,

351
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,380
his armor bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan and his armor bearer slew

352
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,040
after him.

353
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,920
And that first water which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about 20 men, within

354
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,320
as it were and half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

355
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,680
Now I'm thankful that Jonathan had the faith and the expectation to see God work and to

356
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,920
actually take that step of faith.

357
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,640
Again, as I mentioned a moment ago, there comes a point in our lives where we have to

358
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,680
exercise that faith that we say, I believe that God can work.

359
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't think there's one amongst us, in fact, I don't think there are many within the broad

360
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,760
category of Christendom that if you were to ask them the question, do you believe that

361
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,560
God can work?

362
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm not sure many would say no.

363
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,880
I think most people, most Bible-believing Christians, most followers of Christ, if they

364
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,400
were asked the question, do you believe that God is able to work?

365
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,920
That we'd say yes.

366
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,840
We believe that God is able to work.

367
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,880
But are we letting Him?

368
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:19,000
Are we yielding ourselves that He would use us in what He's seeking to accomplish?

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,240
See, I believe, as we look throughout the pages of Scripture, that God uses individuals.

370
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Amen?

371
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,360
God uses people.

372
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,440
You look all throughout the Scriptures, in fact, if you go to the book of Ezekiel, you'll

373
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,920
find that the Bible says that He sought for a man and found none.

374
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,160
That's a sad commentary, is it not?

375
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:46,120
I hope that it would never be said in this congregation, in this region, in our land,

376
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,120
that it would be said that God was seeking for an individual and He found none.

377
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,040
Oh, that we would be yielded.

378
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,520
Listen, we believe that God will work, but are we willing to yield ourselves that God

379
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,120
would use us to accomplish the work that He's seeking to accomplish, that He would work

380
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,260
in and through us?

381
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,840
As we look at the passage of Scripture, and as we've mentioned already, the expectation,

382
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,640
and then of course there's an explanation, an execution of the plan, I want you to notice

383
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
with me the evidence of God working.

384
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,720
As we finish up and look at verses 15 through 23 this evening, we'll notice that there's

385
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,520
great evidence in the passage of Scripture how God was working.

386
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520
It always blesses my heart, as I mentioned by way of introduction, as we looked at those

387
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,000
two passages or referenced those two passages from the book of Psalms.

388
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,260
It's always a blessing when you're able to see that this is the hand of God at work.

389
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,500
As the psalmist said in Psalm 109, that they may know that this is thy hand, that thou,

390
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,580
Lord, hast done it.

391
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,100
And that ought to be our prayer.

392
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,700
See, we're not desirous that God would work in and through us so that we could be recognized

393
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,380
and so that someone would sing our praise and our applause and lift us up.

394
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,820
No, we're seeking that God would use us so that He would be glorified, so that He would

395
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,980
be magnified, so that He would get all of the glory which is due unto His name.

396
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,900
And here we find that in verse number 15, it says, there was trembling in the host,

397
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,300
in the field, and among all the people.

398
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,660
The garrison and the spoilers, they also trembled.

399
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,580
Notice this, and the earth quaked.

400
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,020
So it was a very great trembling.

401
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,180
Did Jonathan and his armor-bearer make the earthquake?

402
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,460
Can't do it, amen?

403
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,020
But God can.

404
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
God can make the earthquake.

405
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,140
Now, I want you to understand something.

406
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,700
Jonathan and his armor-bearer had to make themselves known to the Philistines, right?

407
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,020
They take that step of faith, and listen, I understand, I'd rather God cause the earth

408
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,380
to quake first, amen?

409
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,340
And then I'll discover myself to the Philistines.

410
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,940
But they discover themselves to the Philistines, 20 men are slain, as we find in verse number

411
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,100
14, and then in verse number 15, the Bible tells us the earth quaked.

412
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,660
So it was a very great trembling.

413
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,060
We notice how God is working, and again, we're looking at the evidence of God working.

414
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,060
This is something that Jonathan and his armor-bearer could not do.

415
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,140
They could not take credit for the earth quaking.

416
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,220
As you read through the book of Joshua, as we studied the book of Joshua this year in

417
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,180
the beginning of our COVID shutdown and all the things that were going on as we went through

418
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,180
the book of Joshua, we noticed on a number of occasions in the battles and when they

419
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,700
would go in to conquer the land, how that God worked in very distinct ways.

420
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,900
Why?

421
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,980
So that He would be glorified.

422
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,140
So that it would not be that the people of Israel, the children of Israel, would look

423
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,780
to some military leader to look to some human being, Joshua as being some great leader.

424
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,620
No, God worked miraculously.

425
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Joshua couldn't take credit for having the walls of Jericho fall down flat.

426
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,620
All they did was march around the city.

427
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,100
God did it, amen?

428
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,740
And we can go on and on and look through the book of Joshua, but notice as we continue

429
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,380
to look through this passage, we begin to see how God is working.

430
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,060
It says in verse 16, again, as we look at these next few verses, kind of the scene goes

431
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:37,340
back to the men there at Gibeah, as you notice in verses two through five, as we mentioned,

432
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,540
the scene being set that Saul is there with those 600 men in Ahiah, the priest is there

433
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,540
and the Bible says in verse number 16, the watchmen of Saul and Gibeah of Benjamin looked.

434
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,220
Behold, the multitude melted away.

435
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,100
They went on beating down one another and this caused them to be perplexed as to what's

436
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
going on.

437
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,020
And so Saul said unto the people that were with him in verse number 17, number now and

438
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,700
see who has gone from us.

439
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,420
When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.

440
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,580
Remember, the Bible told us in the beginning of this passage, we began to study in verse

441
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,820
number one, the last statement, but he told not his father, Jonathan did not let Saul

442
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,460
know that he and the armor bearer were leaving.

443
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,100
And here we find that as these that were left, saw in the men that were left back, according

444
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,260
to verses two through five, that they now see what's happening.

445
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,420
They behold, the multitude melted away and they, they, they see this that is unfolding.

446
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,300
And he says, number the people.

447
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,420
They want to see who has gone and they find that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not

448
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
there.

449
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Saul said unto Ahiah, verse number 18, bring hither the ark of God for the ark of God

450
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,060
was at that time with the children of Israel and it came to pass while Saul talked unto

451
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,180
the priest that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased.

452
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,220
And Saul said unto the priest, withdraw thine hand.

453
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,840
And Saul said, excuse me, in verse 20, and Saul and all the people that were with him

454
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,620
assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold, every man's sword was against

455
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,660
his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture.

456
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,180
As we notice in verse number 20, as we continue to understand how that God is working, we

457
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,880
see this on a number of occasions throughout the Old Testament where God will cause such

458
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,020
confusion and chaos that the enemy turns against themselves.

459
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,460
They begin to fight against each other.

460
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,780
Their sword is against one another.

461
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,820
And we find here in verse number 20, it says that they came to the battle.

462
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,060
Behold, every man's sword was against his fellow.

463
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,140
Notice it says, and there was a very great discomfiture.

464
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:37,780
Again, that word has the idea of being a great confusion amongst the people.

465
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,920
No doubt that the earthquaking, as we mentioned in verse number 15, had some influence upon

466
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,540
this which was happening.

467
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,020
It says in verse number 21, interesting note that is made to us here in verse number 21.

468
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,900
Moreover, the Hebrews, notice what it says, that were with the Philistines before that

469
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,760
time, which went up with them into the camp from the country roundabout, even they also

470
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,760
turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

471
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,360
I notice in verse number 21 as I look at what's happening here that there were some children

472
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,560
of Israel, some Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time.

473
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,800
There were some folks that maybe we'd call them traitors.

474
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,040
They were there with the Philistines.

475
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,440
And here the Bible tells us in verse number 21 that those that were with them, that were

476
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,000
with the Philistines before that time, that went into the camp from the country roundabout,

477
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,200
even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

478
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,920
Likewise, verse 22, all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim,

479
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,160
when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in

480
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
the battle.

481
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,840
Now, we notice in verse number 22 that all of those that were hiding, they come out of

482
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,800
their hiding and they follow hard after them in the battle.

483
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,680
Now we see that also in chapter number 17 with the account with David and Goliath, do

484
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
we not?

485
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Everyone's hiding.

486
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,480
David goes out to fight against Goliath and God gives him the victory.

487
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,240
Goliath is slain.

488
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
And then what happens?

489
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,960
Well, the children of Israel come out, right, and they pursue after the Philistines that

490
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,800
are fleeing.

491
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
It's easy.

492
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Let me say this.

493
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,040
It's easier to be on this side than to be the Jonathan and the armor bearer, right?

494
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,840
After you already see something happening, you say, yeah, I'll be part of this.

495
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,840
This is great.

496
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,480
It's easy to be there hiding and see David run out and go into battle against Goliath

497
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,400
and say, you go, David, I'm cheering for you as I'm hiding behind my rock.

498
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,760
Then after David, through the Lord, has victory and the Philistines are running the other

499
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,800
way, we get from behind our rock and say, yeah, we're going forward, right?

500
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,920
It's easier.

501
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,880
But I'm saying who's going to be Jonathan and the armor

502
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,600
bear? Who's going to be the David? Who's going to be the one that has the expectation that God's

503
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,040
going to work and we're going to just trust God to work? We're going to step out of the boat,

504
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,840
so to speak. We're going to be the Peter. You remember in the, uh, the gospel accounts when

505
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,360
Peter and the others are on the ship and they encounter the storm and, uh, it's another storm.

506
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,600
There are many times in which they encountered storms and Jesus comes walking on the water

507
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,120
and they see, and they're frightened at first. And then they understand that it's the Lord.

508
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,840
And Peter says, Lord, if it's thou bid me come unto thee.

509
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,120
And what does Jesus say? Come. What does Peter do? He gets out of the boat.

510
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,640
I don't know how many steps he took on the water before he began to sink, but he took more than me.

511
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,000
He took more than John. He took more than James. Amen. There are other disciples in the boat.

512
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,720
I don't know what they were saying when they were on the boat. I don't know how they were

513
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,560
cheering on Peter or saying you're crazy, Peter. I don't know what they were saying.

514
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:07,240
God doesn't tell us in his word. Maybe someone like Thomas, right? He gets that kind of, uh,

515
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,360
you know, recognition of being doubting Thomas. Maybe when Peter begins, I told you,

516
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,760
you're going to sink. I don't know. I'm not saying that's Bible. I'm just saying,

517
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,440
I don't know what they're saying on the boat, but Peter stepped out of the boat.

518
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,320
Who's going to be the Peter? Who's going to say, I believe God. If you tell me to come,

519
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,480
I don't know how, but I believe I can. He began to sink. We understand that he got his eyes off

520
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,960
of the Lord. The, the wind and the waves were boisterous before he ever stepped out of the boat.

521
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,120
Right? And then he gets his eyes on the circumstances and sees what he's doing.

522
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,080
And maybe in that moment, as he gets his eyes on those things, the Bible tells us that it begins

523
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,440
to sink. And he says, Lord, and he says, save me, help me. And we see that Jesus picks him up.

524
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,760
I believe with all my heart that however far Peter got out of the boat to Jesus,

525
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,400
that he and Jesus walked on water back to the boat.

526
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,520
I don't know how many steps it was. I have no idea. The Bible doesn't tell us,

527
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,160
but again, it was more than James or John or Thomas, or you name all the disciples. They

528
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:24,440
didn't get out of the boat. In fact, as far as we read the scriptures, none of them even had the

529
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,760
thought of saying, if it's thee, bid me come to thee. Peter, Peter.

530
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,240
So as we look at this passage of scripture, as we begin to see Jonathan and the armor baron,

531
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,560
we use other examples throughout the scripture, that of David in the 17th chapter of this same

532
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,640
book, that of Peter. And again, there are countless other examples that we could use in the word of

533
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,240
God. I wonder this evening, which one among us would be the one that would say, Lord, I believe

534
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,720
that you're able to work and I just want to yield myself and let you use me. I want to be a vessel

535
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,440
fit for the master's use. I want to see you work. I don't want to be on the sidelines.

536
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,640
I know that not everyone is into sports and athletics, and I'm certainly not as much as I was

537
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,920
when I was younger. And in fact, I told the family last night, as I was walking down steps, I said,

538
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,840
man, I feel like I'm getting old. And they said, you are. I got encouraging family members. Amen.

539
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:30,520
And so the reality is that when I was younger and I played sports very competitively,

540
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,080
I didn't like being on the sideline. I didn't practice all week so I could sit on the bench.

541
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,560
You understand what I mean? I want to be in the game. And I remember being able to play and

542
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:52,120
to be engaged in the games and to feel as if you had spent all that you had to spend. You had no

543
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,520
energy left, but yet you still wanted to go back out there because you want to get in the game.

544
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:04,280
You want to play. I don't want to be a spectator. And we think about the work of God. I don't want

545
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:11,480
to sit back and watch others be used of God. I want God to use me. I want to be in the work.

546
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,240
I want to see what God's able to do. And I believe God is able to work. And I just,

547
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,560
as we look at what's happening here in chapter number 14, and we noticed that the end of the

548
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,200
passage, it goes, bad Saul makes some rash bowels and everything that happens. And it's a real

549
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,760
mess of a situation. But in these first verses of chapter number 14, I see Jonathan sitting there

550
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,920
and saying, what are we doing sitting here? We serve the Lord God Almighty. He is able to work.

551
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,920
In fact, it's time for him to work. I understand Psalm 119, 126 had not been written yet,

552
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,600
but you understand that it's appropriate that he would have that same thought and that same idea.

553
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,080
God is able and it is time for God to work. And he makes himself available. And he goes and he says,

554
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,560
we're going to make ourselves known to these Philistines. And they're going to respond.

555
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,720
And based upon the response determines our next steps. And they say, come up and we're

556
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:16,200
going to show you something. And they come up and they slay them. And God is going to give victory

557
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:29,560
as we notice in verse number 23, look what the Bible says. So the what? The Lord, not Jonathan,

558
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:41,000
the Prince, not the armor bearer, not Saul, the King, the Lord saved Israel that day.

559
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:49,000
And the battle passed over onto Beth-Avin. It's very interesting as you study the word of God

560
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,000
that you will find that there are many examples, historical records that God has given us in his

561
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,480
word that would record for us times in which God worked apart from using men. In fact, when we

562
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,440
looked at our passage of scripture just a few weeks ago and looked at the situation of Jehoshaphat

563
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,680
and all that was taking place when he said, we don't know what to do, but our eyes are upon

564
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,120
thee. God said, the battle's not yours. It's mine. It's God's. It's the Lord's. And he said,

565
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,720
you're not going to have to do anything. Stand still and see what God's going to do.

566
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,160
And there are times such as the event that we're looking at this evening in first Samuel 14,

567
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,360
when God is using people. I believe that oftentimes we look throughout the scriptures

568
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:41,560
that many times God is using people. He's using men and women. You read through the period of the

569
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,680
judges. You read about all of the oppression and difficulties in which the children of Israel

570
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,640
suffered and dealt with. And God raised up a judge, a man, an individual, a person. We know

571
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,680
that Deborah was used as well there in the book of Judges. And we find that God would raise them up

572
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,720
and he would use them and bring deliverance to his people. Is God able to work without you?

573
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,360
Sure he is. But in God's plan, he's decided, he has determined that he's going to use people.

574
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,880
He's going to use people. I'm thankful that God used Peter. I'm thankful that God used Paul.

575
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,000
We can spend hours speaking about the Apostle Paul.

576
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,560
We can see how that through the persecution of the church and all that was going on and

577
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,680
all that he was dealing with, and then his just conversion, great transformation that took place,

578
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,800
and then how God would use him on the first, second, and third missionary journeys. And he

579
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,280
would go into these places where the gospel had not yet been preached. And he would go in and

580
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,640
he would preach the gospel with power. Why? Because he was yielded.

581
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,160
God was going to get the gospel into these regions, and God used Paul because Paul was available.

582
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,400
There are times in which we look at the Apostle Paul and we say, oh, what a great man of God.

583
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,160
And he was. But he says of himself that he's the chief of sinners, the least of the apostles.

584
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:23,000
But what did he do? He was available. He was surrendered. I am crucified with Christ.

585
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,360
For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. Those are some of the statements of the Apostle

586
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,440
Paul when he's giving his testimony, when he's speaking to the believers in the region of

587
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,200
Galatia, when he's speaking to the believers in Philippi. These are two of the places in

588
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,600
which during those missionary journeys the Apostle Paul went and ministered, and God

589
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:50,440
worked miraculously. God used Paul because Paul made himself available. We could go throughout

590
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,880
modern Bible history and begin to look at various aspects of how God has used people throughout the

591
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,600
centuries and how God has used individuals to get the gospel into certain places, and we could speak

592
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,320
about some of the pioneer missionaries. That when these pioneer missionaries felt the burden,

593
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,640
the call to go to a place like Burma or Myanmar or go to a place of China and some of these other

594
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,560
places in Asia when it was not very common, there weren't other people there, and we find that they

595
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:27,800
received opposition even from the people of God. They went and they labored, and they labored.

596
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:35,880
Why? Because they expected God to work. They expected that God would work. And maybe it

597
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,800
didn't happen immediately. It required years of labor and faithfulness, and they endured hardship

598
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,080
and difficulty and opposition. We read of some of those great, maybe we would use the terminology,

599
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,440
heroes of the faith of modern Christianity, and we'd read of those that went to these

600
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,880
places, and Adonai and Judson perhaps, and...

601
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,340
and some others that labored for years

602
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,360
before finding their first convert,

603
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,140
but yet they remained faithful.

604
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,700
And I just wonder this evening in 2020,

605
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,840
as we look at these passages of scriptures,

606
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,820
we look at these individuals that were used of the Lord,

607
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,980
I wonder who God's gonna use today.

608
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,760
I wonder if we're making ourselves available

609
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,160
for God to use today.

610
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,320
I wonder if we're coming to that place where you say,

611
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,120
I believe that God can work.

612
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,960
But it's not just a hypothetical kind of a thing.

613
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,360
It's not just a theory kind of a thing.

614
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,800
Like I'm actually willing to climb out of the boat thing.

615
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,920
Like I really believe that Jesus,

616
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,920
if you said, come to you, Peter,

617
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,760
that I can walk on that water.

618
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,080
I can't explain it.

619
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,580
I don't know how it's gonna happen, right?

620
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,500
It's against all laws of science, right?

621
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,820
I mean, you're not gonna walk on water,

622
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,060
but Jesus said, come.

623
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,660
So what did he do?

624
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,820
He got out of the boat.

625
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,100
And we know that God uses people just as he used here,

626
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,700
Jonathan and his armor bearer.

627
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,800
The Lord saved Israel that day.

628
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,420
It was God that did the work, but he used his servants.

629
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,380
He used Jonathan, he used the armor bearer.

630
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,480
And will we make ourselves available for God to use?

631
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,920
I understand that we're living in a time of just craziness.

632
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,640
And perhaps there are times in which we scratch our heads

633
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,900
and wonder, what is God doing?

634
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,340
God's at work.

635
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,820
I don't know all that God is doing,

636
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,360
but I know God's at work.

637
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,400
And I want God to use me.

638
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,740
I wanna just make myself available.

639
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,640
We sing a song, I Surrender All.

640
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,500
Someone told me a number of years ago,

641
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,680
they have moved to a different state now,

642
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,700
so no longer attend our church.

643
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,640
But they told me how that the words of that song,

644
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,860
probably 20 years ago,

645
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,180
had such a profound impact in their life.

646
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,120
I surrender all.

647
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,020
And they mentioned that when they came

648
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,660
to one of our services,

649
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,660
that they heard during our invitation that song played

650
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,120
and how it impacted them.

651
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,020
I often have thought this,

652
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,620
and perhaps I've even said it on a number of occasion,

653
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,380
but these are the words of this individual to me,

654
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,820
is that far too often,

655
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,380
a more honest rendition of that song

656
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,980
would be I Surrender Some.

657
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,660
Because too often, we really don't surrender all.

658
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,060
And I thought, it's pretty accurate.

659
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,940
And I wanna be in a place where I say,

660
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,780
I'm all in, surrender all.

661
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,620
Because I believe that God is able to work.

662
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,420
I believe that he is able,

663
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,960
and I believe he uses people.

664
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,660
And this evening, he wants to use you.

665
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,860
He wants to use you for his honor and for his glory.

666
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,260
It is time for thee to work, Lord.

667
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,780
Would you agree that it's time for God to work?

668
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,140
They have made void thy law.

669
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,580
If they made void thy law in Psalm 119, 126,

670
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,400
wow, have they made void God's law today.

671
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,180
It's time for God to work, and God will use people.

672
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,020
Let's pray.

673
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,540
Father, thank you for the passage of scripture

674
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,900
that is before us.

675
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,000
The record of Jonathan and his armor bearer.

676
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm thankful that he had an expectation of you working,

677
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,880
and he communicated that,

678
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,280
and he was willing to not only declare his faith,

679
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,360
but to exercise his faith.

680
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,260
I thank you for how you worked,

681
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,040
what you did on this particular day in saving Israel,

682
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,000
providing victory for your people.

683
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,680
And God, this evening,

684
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,320
we live in a completely different era,

685
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,560
completely different circumstances and situations

686
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,760
in which we face.

687
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,000
But you never change.

688
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,500
You're still upon your throne.

689
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,440
I believe that you're at work,

690
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,620
and I believe there's a great work

691
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,160
that you want to accomplish.

692
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,560
And I pray that your people

693
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,000
would be willing to be a Jonathan,

694
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
an unnamed armor bearer, a David, a Peter, a Paul,

695
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,120
that we would surrender all,

696
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,340
and be in a place where you would use us,

697
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,300
not so that we might be recognized,

698
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,180
not so that man would sing praise or applaud us,

699
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,500
but God, so that you would be exalted,

700
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,500
so that you would be glorified.

701
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,860
It was our prayer, my heart's desire.

702
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,700
I pray that in the few moments of invitation this evening,

703
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,720
that you would work in the hearts of your people.

704
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,500
I pray that decisions would be made

705
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,980
that would not be made out of emotion,

706
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,700
but decisions would be made this evening that would endure

707
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,140
because they're based upon the truth of your word,

708
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,940
and that God, you would use us

709
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,180
to exalt and magnify your name.

710
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,660
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do.

711
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,860
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

712
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,740
Would you stand with me?

713
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,820
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

714
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,020
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.
