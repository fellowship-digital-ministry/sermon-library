00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
this morning that I'll be preaching from this passage of Scripture. And this, as far as I am

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.279
aware, this will be the final message that I'll preach here in 2020. I'll give a thought on

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.319
Wednesday evening during our Christmas service, but I won't be preaching a full message. We'll

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:20.000
have a number of other things going on. I do encourage you to be here. I'm sure it will be

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.639
a blessing to you on Wednesday evening, our Christmas service. But this evening, as we look

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:30.959
at this portion of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 23. And as we look

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:36.720
at the passage of Scripture, I am mindful of what the psalmist declared. And I want to read to you

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.080
a text of Scripture from the book of Psalms. You stay here in 1 Samuel 14. I'm just going to read

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.200
it and then use it as a springboard to come back to our passage here. But in Psalm 119, in verse

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:57.439
126, the psalmist declared, it is time for thee, Lord, to work. For they have made void thy law.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.040
I understand that at the time of the event that we'll look at this evening in 1 Samuel 14, at the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.639
time of this event, Psalm 119 had not yet been written. I understand that Jonathan could not go

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:18.239
to the book of Psalms and read Psalm 119 and verse number 126. But as we look at this passage

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:24.239
of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, no doubt there was an understanding to the circumstances in which

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:30.800
they were facing and the need for God to work. I believe that throughout the history of mankind,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.919
that as we have had the verse of Scripture in Psalm 119 and verse 126, that many times

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:46.080
this verse has been quoted, many times men of God and people of God have pleaded with God

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.519
to work. And I'm thankful that God is able to work. I'm thankful that God is working.

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:56.879
I am thankful that God is always at work. The reality is that there are times in our lives

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:03.599
when we do not see exactly how the Lord is working. And perhaps it is some point down the future

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.639
that we can look back at the events and we can say, that's how God was working.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.000
That's what God was doing. That's what God was orchestrating. And at the very moment as we're

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.199
living life, as we're going through the events, maybe we don't really see what God is doing or

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:24.880
how God is working, but we can rest in the fact that God is working. I also consider the words

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.080
of the psalmist in Psalm 109, verses 26 and 27, when the psalmist said this, help me, O Lord my God.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:40.559
O save me according to thy mercy. Notice that they may know that this is thy hand,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.080
that thou Lord has done it. I believe that we would echo the words of the psalmist in Psalm

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.199
119 and verse 126. It is time for thee Lord to work for they have made void thy law. But I long

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:01.199
to see God work in such a manner as what the psalmist declares in Psalm 109, verses 26 and 27,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:08.800
that it would be absolutely clear, abundantly known that it was God that worked. That it is

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.800
not man that has orchestrated some things, that it's not just our scheme and our plan. Know that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.119
God has worked. As we look at the passage of Scripture in 1 Samuel 14, we read this event in

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.279
the life of Jonathan, and I want to draw your attention to verse number six. I'll begin in

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.399
verse number one as we get into the message, but notice in verse number six, I'll give you the

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.559
title and we'll get going. The Bible says, and Jonathan said to the young man that bear his

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:42.960
armor, come and let us go over under the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the Lord

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:52.399
will work for us for there's no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. I've taken part

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:59.279
of this sixth verse of 1 Samuel 14 to use as our title this evening. It may be that the Lord will

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:05.279
work for us. It may be that the Lord will work for us. Notice if we dig into the passage in verses

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:10.320
one through seven, if you're taking notes this evening, number one, the expectation of Jonathan.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.639
The Bible says in 1 Samuel 14 in verse number one, it says, now it came to pass upon a day

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.640
that Jonathan, the son of Saul said unto the young man that bear his armor, come and let us go over

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.239
the Philistines garrison that is on the other side, but he told not his father. Now who's Jonathan's

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.519
father? Saul, the king of Israel. And we find that Jonathan is there and this young man, his armor

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:36.000
bearer, we do not know his name at this point. We find that Jonathan is there and he's in this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.480
situation and he says to this man, it's interesting that it says that it came upon a day. And Jonathan

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.040
Saul's son, the son of the king, he says to his armor bearer, come and let us go over to the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.679
Philistines garrison that is on the other side. Now in the next few verses of scripture, really in

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:01.359
verses two through five, it's almost like a parenthetical where God is helping us to understand

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:07.040
the scene, that he's setting for us the scene, the backdrop for what is happening in Israel during

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.200
this particular time. The Bible says in verse number two, and Saul tarried in the uttermost

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.279
part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree, which is in Migron. And the people that were with him

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:24.799
were about 600 men. Now keep in mind that Saul is the king and he is the king and he's there and

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:31.679
he's under this pomegranate tree in this particular area. It's in Migron according to verse number two

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:37.200
and with him are about 600 men. It continues in verse number three and tells us that Ahiah,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.040
the son of Ahitab, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord's priest,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.760
and Shiloh wearing an ephod. So he's there as well. And it says that the people knew not

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.359
that Jonathan was gone. And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over into the

00:05:55.359 --> 00:06:00.079
Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.480
And the name of the one was Boaz and the name of the other was Sina. The forefront of the one was

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.720
Situate northward and against Michmash and the other southward over against Gibeah. And so as

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.600
we look at verses two through five, we find that God is providing for us again, setting the scene

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.839
and helping us to understand what's going on. Saul is there. He's got all of these men with

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:28.480
them. And Jonathan says to his armor bearer, let us go over and let us go over to the Philistines'

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.279
garrison that is on the other side. The details that are provided in verses four and five with

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.119
regard to these sharp rocks, of course, this doesn't mean a whole lot to us if we've not

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:42.880
traveled and studied the geography. But we find that for the original recipients of this book,

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:48.480
as they would be reading about the history, they would have an understanding exactly of the layout

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.959
of where they were and what was going on. And as we find that God would give us that parenthetical

00:06:54.959 --> 00:07:00.559
to help us see what's going on, I want you to keep in mind that Jonathan, as we look in verse

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:06.320
number one again in verse number six, that his expectation is clearly seen. In verse number six,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.040
Jonathan then says to the young man that bear his armor, come and let us go over under the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.320
garrison to these uncircumcised. Speaking of the Philistines, again, he says this, it may be that

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.799
the Lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. I believe

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:28.000
that as we look here in verse one, in verse number six, and we begin to see the expectation of

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.600
Jonathan, I believe that he had confidence in the fact that God was able to work. I believe that

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.559
Jonathan was able to demonstrate to his armor bearer, not only his confidence, but his faith

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:43.920
that God was going to work. Why? Because the armor bearer is going to go with them.

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:50.559
And we find that at the end of verse number six, that Jonathan says this, there is no restraint to

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:57.760
the Lord to save by many or by few. Now you are mindful that Jonathan says to his armor bearer,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760
let us go over under the garrison of the Philistines. How many people are going?

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:09.119
Come on, this isn't hard. Two. Thank you. All right. Jonathan and his armor bearer, two.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:18.079
Saul is back under the pomegranate tree with how many? 600. Right? That's kind of a big difference.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.320
Right? But what's Jonathan saying? Listen, Saul's under there. He's over under the pomegranate tree.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.399
There's this situation that's going on with the Philistines and all that's taking place.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:33.119
And Jonathan says, I believe that God is able to do something. I believe that God is able to work.

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:38.080
And listen, it is, there's no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:46.479
God can work and God does work. And oftentimes he works in situations in which he alone would

00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:50.640
be the one to receive the glory. He's going to use Jonathan and his armor bearer here in amazing way.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.919
As we study through the passage of scripture, we're going to see what unfolds and we'll see

00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:00.000
how God works and what God does. But we notice here that Jonathan, what is it that he was

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.440
expecting? I believe with all of my heart, as I read this passage of scripture, that he was expecting

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.000
God to work. He says, it may be that the Lord will work for us. I don't think that that's a

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:18.239
statement or a declaration of, well, it might happen kind of a situation. He's understanding

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:23.200
that God is able, as we mentioned already, as we looked at the Psalmist in Psalm 119, when he says

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.400
it is time for thee to work Lord, that we have seen throughout the history of mankind, that we

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.840
have experienced in our own lives, the work of God. And when God is engaged in doing a work, when God

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.479
is doing something and he's using his people, how he alone is glorified and we see the impact of God

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:49.679
working. And I believe this evening that Jonathan had every expectation that God was going to work.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:56.000
And I wonder at the onset of the message this evening, do we as God's people in 2020,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.840
are we expecting God to work? Are we expecting God?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840
to do something?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.380
Are we looking to the Lord God Almighty,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.220
Jehovah, El Shaddai?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.260
Are we looking to Him to work?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.020
To do something?

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.600
There are times in which we look at

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.260
the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.800
and during His life and ministry,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.460
that short period of time

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.300
in which His public ministry is recounted for us

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.060
in the Gospel records,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.400
we find that on a number of occasions,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.860
that individuals came to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.640
asking Him to work.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.720
Heal my son.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.840
Heal my daughter.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.180
Deal with my servant.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.600
Help in this situation.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.880
And this evening, we understand

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.600
that there is no restraint on God working

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.000
and on God saving by many or by few.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.960
There are times in which we falsely

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.760
have come to the conclusion

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.760
or we have had the belief

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.560
that God needs this great number of people

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.840
in order to do something.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.740
We sing the hymn.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.780
It's not in our hymnal,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.780
but we sing the hymn,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.420
Little Is Much When God Is In It.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.540
And I like that hymn.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.620
I love that song.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.900
What a powerful truth is contained

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.300
within the words of that wonderful hymn.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.220
Little is much when God is in it.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.180
And I believe that.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.220
And here we find that Jonathan,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.100
as we look at this passage,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.980
we begin to see what he expected.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.860
In v. 7, his armor bearer said unto him,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.420
he responds to Jonathan,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.260
it says,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.000
Do all that is in thine heart, turn thee.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.320
Again, no doubt that Jonathan was able

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.400
to have an influence upon his armor bearer.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.320
Again, as you look at the situation

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.800
and you look at all that's going on,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.440
Saul over here with these 600 men,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.520
the priest is there,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.280
and Jonathan says to his armor bearer,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.120
two of them, let us go over

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.480
unto the garrison of these Philistines.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.700
And the armor bearer,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.220
as he hears and understands what Jonathan is saying,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.460
the armor bearer says,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.340
Do all that is in thine heart, turn thee.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.340
Behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.660
I'm thankful that the armor bearer

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.260
responded the way that he did.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.720
Because he was going to have a great experience.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.560
He could have said,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.660
No, Jonathan, you know what?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.860
You're going to fly solo tonight.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.780
I'm not interested in going.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.260
But Jonathan influenced this armor bearer

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.480
to the point that the armor bearer agrees to go

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.720
and tells him that he would be with him.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.480
Not only do we see the expectation,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.660
I want you to notice the explanation of the plan.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.480
In verses eight through 10,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.160
Jonathan is going to explain this plan to his armor bearer.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.100
I would say this,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.280
if I were to just kind of summarize these verses,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.760
this is a declaration of his faith.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.440
The Bible says that as he is going through this plan

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.200
and explaining it to the armor bearer,

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.800
really, it's a simple plan.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.580
Jonathan said, notice in verse number eight,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.660
then said, Jonathan, behold,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.940
we will pass over unto these men

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.940
and we will discover ourselves unto them.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.940
So in other words,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.180
we're going to go and let them know that we're here.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.180
Now I've never been in any kind of a covert operation.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.860
I've never been in the armed forces,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.060
but something about some of the strategy begins to say,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.540
why are you going to make yourself known?

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.980
Because they're expecting God to work.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.740
It wasn't based upon what they were going to do.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.960
It was based upon what God was going to do

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.960
and how God was going to work.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.520
And we notice that Jonathan says,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.160
we're going to discover ourselves unto them.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.720
And then we're going to wait for their response.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.720
And how they respond is going to dictate what we do.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.560
That's what he says.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.200
Notice in verse number nine,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.560
if they, these Philistines,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.560
if they say unto us,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.120
Terry, until we come to you,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.640
then we will stand still in our place

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.540
and will not go up unto them.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.880
So we're going to make ourselves known.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.620
We're going to discover ourselves unto them.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.660
And we're going to wait to see what they say.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.460
And if they say, hey, you, Terry there,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.300
we're going to come to you.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.780
Then we're just going to stand still

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.100
and wait for them to come.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.100
Verse number 10.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.100
But if they say thus, come up unto us,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.500
then we will go up for the Lord

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.880
hath delivered them into our hand.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.660
And this shall be a sign unto us.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.260
We find that Jonathan explains this very simple plan

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.440
to his armor bearer.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.600
And we notice at the end of verse number 10,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.340
that he says that this would be the sign

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.180
for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.540
And as soon as you come to verse number 11,

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.180
not, I mean, the explanation of the plan is pretty simple,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.340
but now let's notice the execution of the plan

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.120
in verses 11 through 14.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.700
As we make our way through the passage,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.480
the Bible says in verse number 11,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.560
and both of them, who's that?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.160
That's Jonathan and the armor bearer.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.620
They both discover themselves

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.680
under the garrison of the Philistines.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.640
Now, can you imagine being there?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.400
I mean, honestly, put yourself in a situation

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.720
and you're going to just go ahead and make yourself,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.880
there's two of you,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.000
and you're going to discover yourselves.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.480
You're going to make yourself known

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.120
to this group of these Philistines.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.820
The enemies, as we find,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.220
as you look throughout the pages of 1 Samuel in particular,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.540
you'll find a number of times in which

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.260
the nation of Israel is in battle against the Philistines.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.340
And you find this continuing going on.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.020
And you find that in verse number 11,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.860
it says, and both of them discovered themselves

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.540
under the garrison of the Philistines.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.780
Notice the Philistines said,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.100
behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.940
where they had hid themselves.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.360
Now, why were they hiding?

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.300
I'm assuming they were hiding in this passage

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.660
the same reason they were hiding in 1 Samuel 17.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.980
We're very familiar with 1 Samuel 17

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.740
because it's in 1 Samuel 17 that we read

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.020
of when David slew Goliath.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.660
We're very familiar with the passage of scripture

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.020
in 1 Samuel 17.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.100
And we understand, again, as I mentioned,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.460
that for this period of time in Israel's history,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.580
there's a continual battle

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.780
between the Philistines and the children of Israel.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.260
It's just an ongoing saga that happens over and over

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.800
and there's one side wins

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.860
and then they come back and so on and so forth.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.260
And we find that in 1 Samuel 17,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.580
the Bible tells us that they're all hiding, right?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.860
The giant of the Philistines, Goliath,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.020
he would come out and he would give his challenge.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.780
And what was Saul and all the men of war,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.620
what were they doing?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.440
They were hiding.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.220
And David comes and he hears what's declared

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.740
and he says, is there not a cause?

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.980
And we, of course, understand as we read

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.300
through the 17th chapter.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.140
But here in chapter number 14,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.460
we find that Jonathan and his armor bearer

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.200
discover themselves to these Philistines

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.720
and they say, behold, the Hebrews come forth

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.240
out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.320
The men of the garrison answered Jonathan

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.040
and his armor bearer and said, come up to us.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.840
I think those were good words that they heard, amen?

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.760
I think that Jonathan and his armor bearer

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.260
as they heard these Philistines,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.920
as they discovered themselves,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.080
they made themselves known,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.640
their selves known to these Philistines.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.260
And the Philistines say in verse number 12,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.420
come up to us.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.620
And then they say this, and we will show you a thing.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.980
I'm not sure all that's meant within that statement.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.220
I'm not sure of the talking trash,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.220
if we could use that terminology of this particular era,

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.580
but they say, come up to us

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.980
and we're gonna show you a thing.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.860
Little did they know that Jonathan and his armor bearer

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.820
were going in the power of God.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.000
They had already, Jonathan had already declared

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.520
the fact that God was able to work.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.720
He'd already had this expectation

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.360
that God was going to work.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.360
His plan from a military perspective,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.960
from a combat perspective,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.360
if he sat in a room with a bunch of generals

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.960
and said, here's what we're gonna do.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.680
We know that the enemy's over there

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.280
and we're gonna make ourselves known to the enemy.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.600
We're gonna do what?

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.600
Why would we do that?

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.180
Because we're expecting God to work.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.780
And they say, come up to us

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.860
and we will show you a thing.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.220
And Jonathan said unto his armor bearer,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.140
and I think he said it with excitement,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.140
come up after me, for the Lord hath delivered them

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.780
into the hands, excuse me, the hand of Israel.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.059
As I mentioned that the explanation of the plan

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.980
would be that of maybe declaring faith,

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.400
I would say that the execution of the plan

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.280
would be exercising faith.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.160
See, it's one thing to say,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.080
I believe that God's going to work.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.360
It's another thing to say, here's how God is able to work.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.640
But then when do you actually discover yourself

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.540
to the Philistines, you understand?

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.320
That's that taking the step of faith.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.340
That's the exercising faith.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.760
That's saying, I'm not just gonna talk about it

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.180
in some kind of think tank, kind of a possible way,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.240
hypothetical, it could, it couldn't.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.880
No, I'm expecting God to work

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.020
and I'm going to exercise faith.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.820
I'm gonna discover myself to these Philistines.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.660
And the Bible tells us as we look here

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.720
at the passage of Scripture that once again,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.600
that Jonathan would declare his confidence

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.880
in God's ability to work where the Bible says,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.880
the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.580
At this particular time, there's not even been a skirmish.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.660
The first person has not yet been slain.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.100
But yet Jonathan understands that through this process

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.340
of time and through all that has taken place,

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.000
that this was the sign.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.900
Remember he says in verse number 10,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.860
this shall be a sign unto us.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.860
And the way in which things have unfolded

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.260
in the execution of the plan,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.860
he has this great confidence that God would give them

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.980
And the victory, verse number 13, and Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.380
his armor bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan and his armor bearer slew

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.040
after him.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.920
And that first water which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about 20 men, within

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:23.320
as it were and half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.680
Now I'm thankful that Jonathan had the faith and the expectation to see God work and to

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.920
actually take that step of faith.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.640
Again, as I mentioned a moment ago, there comes a point in our lives where we have to

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.680
exercise that faith that we say, I believe that God can work.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.320
I don't think there's one amongst us, in fact, I don't think there are many within the broad

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.760
category of Christendom that if you were to ask them the question, do you believe that

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.560
God can work?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.400
I'm not sure many would say no.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.880
I think most people, most Bible-believing Christians, most followers of Christ, if they

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.400
were asked the question, do you believe that God is able to work?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.920
That we'd say yes.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.840
We believe that God is able to work.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.880
But are we letting Him?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:19.000
Are we yielding ourselves that He would use us in what He's seeking to accomplish?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.240
See, I believe, as we look throughout the pages of Scripture, that God uses individuals.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.240
Amen?

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.360
God uses people.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.440
You look all throughout the Scriptures, in fact, if you go to the book of Ezekiel, you'll

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.920
find that the Bible says that He sought for a man and found none.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.160
That's a sad commentary, is it not?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:46.120
I hope that it would never be said in this congregation, in this region, in our land,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.120
that it would be said that God was seeking for an individual and He found none.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.040
Oh, that we would be yielded.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.520
Listen, we believe that God will work, but are we willing to yield ourselves that God

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.120
would use us to accomplish the work that He's seeking to accomplish, that He would work

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.260
in and through us?

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.840
As we look at the passage of Scripture, and as we've mentioned already, the expectation,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.640
and then of course there's an explanation, an execution of the plan, I want you to notice

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.880
with me the evidence of God working.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.720
As we finish up and look at verses 15 through 23 this evening, we'll notice that there's

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.520
great evidence in the passage of Scripture how God was working.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.520
It always blesses my heart, as I mentioned by way of introduction, as we looked at those

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.000
two passages or referenced those two passages from the book of Psalms.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.260
It's always a blessing when you're able to see that this is the hand of God at work.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:47.500
As the psalmist said in Psalm 109, that they may know that this is thy hand, that thou,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.580
Lord, hast done it.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.100
And that ought to be our prayer.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.700
See, we're not desirous that God would work in and through us so that we could be recognized

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.380
and so that someone would sing our praise and our applause and lift us up.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.820
No, we're seeking that God would use us so that He would be glorified, so that He would

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.980
be magnified, so that He would get all of the glory which is due unto His name.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.900
And here we find that in verse number 15, it says, there was trembling in the host,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.300
in the field, and among all the people.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.660
The garrison and the spoilers, they also trembled.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.580
Notice this, and the earth quaked.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.020
So it was a very great trembling.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.180
Did Jonathan and his armor-bearer make the earthquake?

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.460
Can't do it, amen?

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.020
But God can.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.020
God can make the earthquake.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.140
Now, I want you to understand something.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:52.700
Jonathan and his armor-bearer had to make themselves known to the Philistines, right?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.020
They take that step of faith, and listen, I understand, I'd rather God cause the earth

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.380
to quake first, amen?

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.340
And then I'll discover myself to the Philistines.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.940
But they discover themselves to the Philistines, 20 men are slain, as we find in verse number

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.100
14, and then in verse number 15, the Bible tells us the earth quaked.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.660
So it was a very great trembling.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.060
We notice how God is working, and again, we're looking at the evidence of God working.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.060
This is something that Jonathan and his armor-bearer could not do.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.140
They could not take credit for the earth quaking.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.220
As you read through the book of Joshua, as we studied the book of Joshua this year in

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.180
the beginning of our COVID shutdown and all the things that were going on as we went through

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.180
the book of Joshua, we noticed on a number of occasions in the battles and when they

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.700
would go in to conquer the land, how that God worked in very distinct ways.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.900
Why?

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.980
So that He would be glorified.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.140
So that it would not be that the people of Israel, the children of Israel, would look

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.780
to some military leader to look to some human being, Joshua as being some great leader.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.620
No, God worked miraculously.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.620
Joshua couldn't take credit for having the walls of Jericho fall down flat.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.620
All they did was march around the city.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.100
God did it, amen?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.740
And we can go on and on and look through the book of Joshua, but notice as we continue

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.380
to look through this passage, we begin to see how God is working.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:31.060
It says in verse 16, again, as we look at these next few verses, kind of the scene goes

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:37.340
back to the men there at Gibeah, as you notice in verses two through five, as we mentioned,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.540
the scene being set that Saul is there with those 600 men in Ahiah, the priest is there

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:47.540
and the Bible says in verse number 16, the watchmen of Saul and Gibeah of Benjamin looked.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.220
Behold, the multitude melted away.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.100
They went on beating down one another and this caused them to be perplexed as to what's

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.100
going on.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:02.020
And so Saul said unto the people that were with him in verse number 17, number now and

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.700
see who has gone from us.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.420
When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.580
Remember, the Bible told us in the beginning of this passage, we began to study in verse

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.820
number one, the last statement, but he told not his father, Jonathan did not let Saul

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.460
know that he and the armor bearer were leaving.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.100
And here we find that as these that were left, saw in the men that were left back, according

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.260
to verses two through five, that they now see what's happening.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.420
They behold, the multitude melted away and they, they, they see this that is unfolding.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.300
And he says, number the people.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.420
They want to see who has gone and they find that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.420
there.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.140
Saul said unto Ahiah, verse number 18, bring hither the ark of God for the ark of God

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.060
was at that time with the children of Israel and it came to pass while Saul talked unto

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.180
the priest that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.220
And Saul said unto the priest, withdraw thine hand.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.840
And Saul said, excuse me, in verse 20, and Saul and all the people that were with him

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.620
assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold, every man's sword was against

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.660
his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.180
As we notice in verse number 20, as we continue to understand how that God is working, we

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.880
see this on a number of occasions throughout the Old Testament where God will cause such

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.020
confusion and chaos that the enemy turns against themselves.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.460
They begin to fight against each other.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.780
Their sword is against one another.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.820
And we find here in verse number 20, it says that they came to the battle.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.060
Behold, every man's sword was against his fellow.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.140
Notice it says, and there was a very great discomfiture.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:37.780
Again, that word has the idea of being a great confusion amongst the people.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.920
No doubt that the earthquaking, as we mentioned in verse number 15, had some influence upon

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.540
this which was happening.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.020
It says in verse number 21, interesting note that is made to us here in verse number 21.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.900
Moreover, the Hebrews, notice what it says, that were with the Philistines before that

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:00.760
time, which went up with them into the camp from the country roundabout, even they also

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.760
turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.360
I notice in verse number 21 as I look at what's happening here that there were some children

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.560
of Israel, some Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.800
There were some folks that maybe we'd call them traitors.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.040
They were there with the Philistines.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.440
And here the Bible tells us in verse number 21 that those that were with them, that were

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.000
with the Philistines before that time, that went into the camp from the country roundabout,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.200
even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.920
Likewise, verse 22, all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:45.160
when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160
the battle.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.840
Now, we notice in verse number 22 that all of those that were hiding, they come out of

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.800
their hiding and they follow hard after them in the battle.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.680
Now we see that also in chapter number 17 with the account with David and Goliath, do

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680
we not?

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680
Everyone's hiding.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.480
David goes out to fight against Goliath and God gives him the victory.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.240
Goliath is slain.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240
And then what happens?

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.960
Well, the children of Israel come out, right, and they pursue after the Philistines that

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.800
are fleeing.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800
It's easy.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800
Let me say this.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.040
It's easier to be on this side than to be the Jonathan and the armor bearer, right?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.840
After you already see something happening, you say, yeah, I'll be part of this.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.840
This is great.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:37.480
It's easy to be there hiding and see David run out and go into battle against Goliath

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:45.400
and say, you go, David, I'm cheering for you as I'm hiding behind my rock.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.760
Then after David, through the Lord, has victory and the Philistines are running the other

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.800
way, we get from behind our rock and say, yeah, we're going forward, right?

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.920
It's easier.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.880
But I'm saying who's going to be Jonathan and the armor

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.600
bear? Who's going to be the David? Who's going to be the one that has the expectation that God's

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.040
going to work and we're going to just trust God to work? We're going to step out of the boat,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.840
so to speak. We're going to be the Peter. You remember in the, uh, the gospel accounts when

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.360
Peter and the others are on the ship and they encounter the storm and, uh, it's another storm.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.600
There are many times in which they encountered storms and Jesus comes walking on the water

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.120
and they see, and they're frightened at first. And then they understand that it's the Lord.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.840
And Peter says, Lord, if it's thou bid me come unto thee.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:38.120
And what does Jesus say? Come. What does Peter do? He gets out of the boat.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.640
I don't know how many steps he took on the water before he began to sink, but he took more than me.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:51.000
He took more than John. He took more than James. Amen. There are other disciples in the boat.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.720
I don't know what they were saying when they were on the boat. I don't know how they were

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.560
cheering on Peter or saying you're crazy, Peter. I don't know what they were saying.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:07.240
God doesn't tell us in his word. Maybe someone like Thomas, right? He gets that kind of, uh,

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.360
you know, recognition of being doubting Thomas. Maybe when Peter begins, I told you,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.760
you're going to sink. I don't know. I'm not saying that's Bible. I'm just saying,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.440
I don't know what they're saying on the boat, but Peter stepped out of the boat.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:27.320
Who's going to be the Peter? Who's going to say, I believe God. If you tell me to come,

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.480
I don't know how, but I believe I can. He began to sink. We understand that he got his eyes off

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:39.960
of the Lord. The, the wind and the waves were boisterous before he ever stepped out of the boat.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.120
Right? And then he gets his eyes on the circumstances and sees what he's doing.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.080
And maybe in that moment, as he gets his eyes on those things, the Bible tells us that it begins

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.440
to sink. And he says, Lord, and he says, save me, help me. And we see that Jesus picks him up.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.760
I believe with all my heart that however far Peter got out of the boat to Jesus,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.400
that he and Jesus walked on water back to the boat.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.520
I don't know how many steps it was. I have no idea. The Bible doesn't tell us,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:17.160
but again, it was more than James or John or Thomas, or you name all the disciples. They

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:24.440
didn't get out of the boat. In fact, as far as we read the scriptures, none of them even had the

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.760
thought of saying, if it's thee, bid me come to thee. Peter, Peter.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.240
So as we look at this passage of scripture, as we begin to see Jonathan and the armor baron,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.560
we use other examples throughout the scripture, that of David in the 17th chapter of this same

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.640
book, that of Peter. And again, there are countless other examples that we could use in the word of

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:51.240
God. I wonder this evening, which one among us would be the one that would say, Lord, I believe

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:57.720
that you're able to work and I just want to yield myself and let you use me. I want to be a vessel

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.440
fit for the master's use. I want to see you work. I don't want to be on the sidelines.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:11.640
I know that not everyone is into sports and athletics, and I'm certainly not as much as I was

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.920
when I was younger. And in fact, I told the family last night, as I was walking down steps, I said,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:22.840
man, I feel like I'm getting old. And they said, you are. I got encouraging family members. Amen.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:30.520
And so the reality is that when I was younger and I played sports very competitively,

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.080
I didn't like being on the sideline. I didn't practice all week so I could sit on the bench.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:45.560
You understand what I mean? I want to be in the game. And I remember being able to play and

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:52.120
to be engaged in the games and to feel as if you had spent all that you had to spend. You had no

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.520
energy left, but yet you still wanted to go back out there because you want to get in the game.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:04.280
You want to play. I don't want to be a spectator. And we think about the work of God. I don't want

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.480
to sit back and watch others be used of God. I want God to use me. I want to be in the work.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.240
I want to see what God's able to do. And I believe God is able to work. And I just,

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.560
as we look at what's happening here in chapter number 14, and we noticed that the end of the

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.200
passage, it goes, bad Saul makes some rash bowels and everything that happens. And it's a real

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.760
mess of a situation. But in these first verses of chapter number 14, I see Jonathan sitting there

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:40.920
and saying, what are we doing sitting here? We serve the Lord God Almighty. He is able to work.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.920
In fact, it's time for him to work. I understand Psalm 119, 126 had not been written yet,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:52.600
but you understand that it's appropriate that he would have that same thought and that same idea.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:59.080
God is able and it is time for God to work. And he makes himself available. And he goes and he says,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.560
we're going to make ourselves known to these Philistines. And they're going to respond.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.720
And based upon the response determines our next steps. And they say, come up and we're

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:16.200
going to show you something. And they come up and they slay them. And God is going to give victory

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:29.560
as we notice in verse number 23, look what the Bible says. So the what? The Lord, not Jonathan,

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:41.000
the Prince, not the armor bearer, not Saul, the King, the Lord saved Israel that day.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:49.000
And the battle passed over onto Beth-Avin. It's very interesting as you study the word of God

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:57.000
that you will find that there are many examples, historical records that God has given us in his

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.480
word that would record for us times in which God worked apart from using men. In fact, when we

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.440
looked at our passage of scripture just a few weeks ago and looked at the situation of Jehoshaphat

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.680
and all that was taking place when he said, we don't know what to do, but our eyes are upon

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.120
thee. God said, the battle's not yours. It's mine. It's God's. It's the Lord's. And he said,

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.720
you're not going to have to do anything. Stand still and see what God's going to do.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.160
And there are times such as the event that we're looking at this evening in first Samuel 14,

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.360
when God is using people. I believe that oftentimes we look throughout the scriptures

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:41.560
that many times God is using people. He's using men and women. You read through the period of the

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.680
judges. You read about all of the oppression and difficulties in which the children of Israel

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:53.640
suffered and dealt with. And God raised up a judge, a man, an individual, a person. We know

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.680
that Deborah was used as well there in the book of Judges. And we find that God would raise them up

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:05.720
and he would use them and bring deliverance to his people. Is God able to work without you?

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:14.360
Sure he is. But in God's plan, he's decided, he has determined that he's going to use people.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:21.880
He's going to use people. I'm thankful that God used Peter. I'm thankful that God used Paul.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.000
We can spend hours speaking about the Apostle Paul.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.560
We can see how that through the persecution of the church and all that was going on and

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:40.680
all that he was dealing with, and then his just conversion, great transformation that took place,

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.800
and then how God would use him on the first, second, and third missionary journeys. And he

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.280
would go into these places where the gospel had not yet been preached. And he would go in and

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.640
he would preach the gospel with power. Why? Because he was yielded.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:05.160
God was going to get the gospel into these regions, and God used Paul because Paul was available.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.400
There are times in which we look at the Apostle Paul and we say, oh, what a great man of God.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.160
And he was. But he says of himself that he's the chief of sinners, the least of the apostles.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:23.000
But what did he do? He was available. He was surrendered. I am crucified with Christ.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.360
For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. Those are some of the statements of the Apostle

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.440
Paul when he's giving his testimony, when he's speaking to the believers in the region of

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.200
Galatia, when he's speaking to the believers in Philippi. These are two of the places in

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.600
which during those missionary journeys the Apostle Paul went and ministered, and God

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:50.440
worked miraculously. God used Paul because Paul made himself available. We could go throughout

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.880
modern Bible history and begin to look at various aspects of how God has used people throughout the

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.600
centuries and how God has used individuals to get the gospel into certain places, and we could speak

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:07.320
about some of the pioneer missionaries. That when these pioneer missionaries felt the burden,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.640
the call to go to a place like Burma or Myanmar or go to a place of China and some of these other

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:19.560
places in Asia when it was not very common, there weren't other people there, and we find that they

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:27.800
received opposition even from the people of God. They went and they labored, and they labored.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:35.880
Why? Because they expected God to work. They expected that God would work. And maybe it

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:43.800
didn't happen immediately. It required years of labor and faithfulness, and they endured hardship

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:51.080
and difficulty and opposition. We read of some of those great, maybe we would use the terminology,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.440
heroes of the faith of modern Christianity, and we'd read of those that went to these

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.880
places, and Adonai and Judson perhaps, and...

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.340
and some others that labored for years

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.360
before finding their first convert,

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.140
but yet they remained faithful.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.700
And I just wonder this evening in 2020,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.840
as we look at these passages of scriptures,

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.820
we look at these individuals that were used of the Lord,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.980
I wonder who God's gonna use today.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.760
I wonder if we're making ourselves available

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.160
for God to use today.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.320
I wonder if we're coming to that place where you say,

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.120
I believe that God can work.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.960
But it's not just a hypothetical kind of a thing.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.360
It's not just a theory kind of a thing.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.800
Like I'm actually willing to climb out of the boat thing.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.920
Like I really believe that Jesus,

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.920
if you said, come to you, Peter,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.760
that I can walk on that water.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.080
I can't explain it.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.580
I don't know how it's gonna happen, right?

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.500
It's against all laws of science, right?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.820
I mean, you're not gonna walk on water,

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.060
but Jesus said, come.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.660
So what did he do?

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.820
He got out of the boat.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.100
And we know that God uses people just as he used here,

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.700
Jonathan and his armor bearer.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.800
The Lord saved Israel that day.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.420
It was God that did the work, but he used his servants.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.380
He used Jonathan, he used the armor bearer.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.480
And will we make ourselves available for God to use?

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.920
I understand that we're living in a time of just craziness.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.640
And perhaps there are times in which we scratch our heads

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.900
and wonder, what is God doing?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.340
God's at work.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.820
I don't know all that God is doing,

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.360
but I know God's at work.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.400
And I want God to use me.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.740
I wanna just make myself available.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:58.640
We sing a song, I Surrender All.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.500
Someone told me a number of years ago,

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.680
they have moved to a different state now,

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.700
so no longer attend our church.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.640
But they told me how that the words of that song,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.860
probably 20 years ago,

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.180
had such a profound impact in their life.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.120
I surrender all.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.020
And they mentioned that when they came

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.660
to one of our services,

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.660
that they heard during our invitation that song played

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.120
and how it impacted them.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.020
I often have thought this,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.620
and perhaps I've even said it on a number of occasion,

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.380
but these are the words of this individual to me,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.820
is that far too often,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.380
a more honest rendition of that song

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.980
would be I Surrender Some.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.660
Because too often, we really don't surrender all.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.060
And I thought, it's pretty accurate.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.940
And I wanna be in a place where I say,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.780
I'm all in, surrender all.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.620
Because I believe that God is able to work.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.420
I believe that he is able,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.960
and I believe he uses people.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.660
And this evening, he wants to use you.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.860
He wants to use you for his honor and for his glory.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.260
It is time for thee to work, Lord.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.780
Would you agree that it's time for God to work?

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.140
They have made void thy law.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.580
If they made void thy law in Psalm 119, 126,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.400
wow, have they made void God's law today.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.180
It's time for God to work, and God will use people.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.020
Let's pray.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.540
Father, thank you for the passage of scripture

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.900
that is before us.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.000
The record of Jonathan and his armor bearer.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I'm thankful that he had an expectation of you working,

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.880
and he communicated that,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.280
and he was willing to not only declare his faith,

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.360
but to exercise his faith.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.260
I thank you for how you worked,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.040
what you did on this particular day in saving Israel,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.000
providing victory for your people.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.680
And God, this evening,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.320
we live in a completely different era,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.560
completely different circumstances and situations

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.760
in which we face.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.000
But you never change.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.500
You're still upon your throne.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.440
I believe that you're at work,

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.620
and I believe there's a great work

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.160
that you want to accomplish.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.560
And I pray that your people

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.000
would be willing to be a Jonathan,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
an unnamed armor bearer, a David, a Peter, a Paul,

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.120
that we would surrender all,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.340
and be in a place where you would use us,

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.300
not so that we might be recognized,

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.180
not so that man would sing praise or applaud us,

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.500
but God, so that you would be exalted,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.500
so that you would be glorified.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.860
It was our prayer, my heart's desire.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.700
I pray that in the few moments of invitation this evening,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.720
that you would work in the hearts of your people.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.500
I pray that decisions would be made

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.980
that would not be made out of emotion,

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.700
but decisions would be made this evening that would endure

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.140
because they're based upon the truth of your word,

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.940
and that God, you would use us

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.180
to exalt and magnify your name.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.660
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.860
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.740
Would you stand with me?

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.820
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.020
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.
