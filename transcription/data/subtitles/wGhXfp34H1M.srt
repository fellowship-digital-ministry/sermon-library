1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,199
And Luke chapter 11, and for the next several Wednesday evenings, we're going to study through

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:08,479
this portion of Scripture.

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:12,600
And if you say, well, I thought we were studying through the Leviticus, I did too, but the

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,879
Holy Spirit and God is in control, and He has led me, I believe, thoroughly believe,

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,459
to deal with this subject matter over the next several weeks.

6
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:28,299
And really, the passage that is before us is a familiar passage.

7
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:35,240
The subject of prayer is a subject that has been often discussed, probably, for each of

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,959
us as the people of God, if we'd be honest before the Lord and transparent with ourselves,

9
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:47,880
we would say that it's this area of our lives that needs the most regular evaluation, the

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,479
area of our prayer life.

11
00:00:50,479 --> 00:01:00,459
And the reality is that we need a revival of prayer in our personal lives, in our homes,

12
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,459
in our churches.

13
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:07,660
The Lord Jesus Christ said that the church was to be a house of prayer.

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:15,059
If you look across the landscape of our nation, you find that the house of God, quote-unquote,

15
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:18,379
has become an entertainment house.

16
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,379
It's unfortunate.

17
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,319
It's to be a house of prayer.

18
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,559
I will be honest and transparent with you this evening that two of the last three Sunday

19
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:32,440
mornings as we've been teaching and preaching through the book of Colossians, the subject

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,199
matter has been on prayer.

21
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:41,199
And God has used those portions of Scripture as I have had the opportunity not only to

22
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:47,000
prepare them and meditate upon them as I would prepare the messages, but then even as I would

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,319
deliver the messages, God has used the truths of those passages to encourage me, yes, but

24
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,459
to convict me greatly.

25
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,379
And I hope that God's Word convicts you in your life as well.

26
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,819
It's supposed to.

27
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,779
Conviction's a good thing, amen?

28
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:11,339
Sometimes we look at conviction as being a bad thing, but the reality is that it's good

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,740
for me to be convicted when I read and study the Word of God, when I hear the Word of God

30
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,000
preached and taught for the Holy Spirit of God to use the Word of God to speak to the

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,639
heart of man.

32
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,520
That's a precious thing.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,960
And the reality is that as we've studied those portions of Scripture, the conviction I would

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,520
say that I've experienced personally, I hope that you too, as you've listened to those

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,199
messages and allowed the Holy Spirit of God to use His Word in your life, I hope that

36
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,979
perhaps we would evaluate our lives and say, how is my prayer life?

37
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,360
How is my prayer life?

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,039
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message this evening,

39
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,000
teach us to pray.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Teach us to pray.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,279
And over the next several weeks, we're going to go little by little through this passage

43
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:13,839
of Scripture, and we will learn, hopefully, what it is that God wants us to learn from

44
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:18,880
this portion of Scripture, but as we would learn this, the important thing of prayer

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,300
is not to simply be able to talk about prayer.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,919
The reality is that many people can talk about the subject of prayer.

47
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:35,039
In fact, I would say this, it is easier for me to preach or teach a message on prayer

48
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,600
than to pray.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,160
It is.

50
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:47,440
It is easier to teach about prayer, to preach about prayer, than it is to actually engage

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,000
in prayer.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,259
Why is that?

53
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,720
Because prayer is a spiritual battle.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,320
And the reality this evening is that as we look at this familiar passage of Scripture,

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:08,160
the Bible tells us, and it came to pass in Luke 11, and it came to pass, notice this,

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,199
that as He was praying in a certain place, the He is Jesus.

57
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,920
The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, God in flesh, He is praying, He's in a certain

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,600
place, and no doubt as we would look at the passage of Scripture and we'd understand what's

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,880
taking place, we'd have to conclude that the disciples had observed what was taking

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
place.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,239
The disciples saw the Lord Jesus Christ engaged in prayer.

62
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:45,559
For the Bible tells us that He was praying in a certain place, notice this, when He ceased,

63
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:58,000
one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,399
We'll only get into the first part of verse number two this evening because we're going

65
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,839
to take little snippets of this passage of Scripture over the next several weeks and

66
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,720
spend some time studying the Word of God, and then most importantly spend some time

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,799
implementing the truth of the Word of God and praying.

68
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:20,440
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I would simply say this, number one, the request

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
of the disciples.

70
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,720
You say, well, this is a pretty easy outline, I agree.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,760
But as we think about the request of the disciples, we understand that they only make the request

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,200
because of what they observed.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,640
If they did not observe the Lord Jesus Christ praying, no doubt they wouldn't have said,

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,899
teach us to pray.

75
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:45,660
But they observed the Lord Jesus Christ engaged in prayer, which leads to one of the disciples

76
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,420
saying to the Lord, teach us to pray.

77
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,859
It's a simple yet profound request.

78
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,619
They recognized the position of Jesus Christ.

79
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:08,140
You know in the passage that the disciples said unto Him, Lord, He is Lord, Lord, teach

80
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,820
us to pray.

81
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,980
Have you ever considered how many things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach

82
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,339
them?

83
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:24,779
Honestly, how many things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach them?

84
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:31,040
What we have recorded in the Word of God is but one request from the disciples with regard

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,859
to what they desire Jesus to teach them, and it's here.

86
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:39,660
Teach us to pray.

87
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,500
They had seen Jesus, they had heard Jesus, maybe it would be a better way to say it,

88
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,260
they had heard Jesus teach, no doubt, and preach.

89
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,779
But they never said, Lord, teach us to preach.

90
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,940
We don't read it in the Scriptures.

91
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,700
They never said, Lord, teach us how to teach.

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,200
They'd seen the Lord perform a number of miracles.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,559
They never said, Lord, teach us how to do these miracles.

94
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:13,559
They had the opportunity to see the Lord Jesus Christ heal many people.

95
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,079
They never said, Lord, teach us how to heal.

96
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:24,519
But when they observed the Lord Jesus Christ in prayer, they said, Lord, teach us to pray.

97
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,959
I wonder this evening if we would think about the subject specifically of the first statement

98
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,359
that I made with regard to hearing the Lord Jesus Christ teach and preach, and I'll use

99
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:43,239
this because it fits for me personally as the application, if I would learn to pray

100
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:50,399
as I ought to pray, the teaching and preaching would be power-filled by the Holy Spirit of

101
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,239
God.

102
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,760
I need to learn how to pray.

103
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,239
The disciples need to learn how to pray.

104
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,480
Teach us to pray.

105
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,679
As we think about the request of these disciples and we think about the fact that the Word

106
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:10,079
of God in all of the Gospel accounts, as the record is given, that we have in Holy Scripture

107
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:17,839
of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, these disciples make this simple request.

108
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,480
Simple yet profound.

109
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,920
You note with me in the text of Scripture that they say, Lord, teach us to pray.

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,440
They don't say, Lord, teach us how to pray.

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,919
It's not a formula that we pray.

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,359
The reality is the passage of Scripture that is before us, coupled with, if you were to

113
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:42,159
go to Matthew chapter number 6 and look at the record of Matthew 6 of this same account

114
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,320
that is given, you will find that many people within the broad category of Christendom have

115
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,559
referred to this passage as the Lord's Prayer.

116
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,880
And unfortunately, there are many people groups, the religions, organized religions,

117
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,599
that would pray verbatim the words of this passage of Scripture.

118
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,640
They've memorized it.

119
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,880
It's just a memorized prayer.

120
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,080
Jesus did not tell His disciples to pray this prayer.

121
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,359
They did not ask to teach us how to pray, though Jesus would give them instruction on

122
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,200
how to pray, but teach us to pray.

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:36,080
If we're not careful, if I'm not careful, sometimes prayer can become just rote religion.

124
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,479
Just a religious exercise that we've kind of memorized some little kind of a prayer.

125
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:48,559
Maybe it's not the same type of memorized prayer that some denomination uses, but for

126
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,359
us, we have our Baptist memorized prayers, if you will, and it's very possible for us

127
00:09:55,359 --> 00:10:01,280
to just kind of get into a routine, if you will, where we're almost on autopilot.

128
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,520
You ever get on autopilot in your life?

129
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Let me ask you this.

130
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,799
Is there a place, maybe, I know we're kind of different now because of driving not as

131
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,880
much with people working from home and what have you, but is there ever a time, if you

132
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,039
can think way back to 2019 when you would drive to and from work every day, has there

133
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:26,400
been a time that you've been so just on autopilot that you're driving and you go through a few

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
intersections, you know, I don't even know if that light was green or not.

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
I mean, I'm pretty sure it was green.

136
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Have you been there?

137
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,559
You're just on autopilot.

138
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,520
Can I tell you if we're not careful, we can do that in our prayer life, that it just becomes

139
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
routine.

140
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,080
It just becomes, this is my prayers.

141
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm saying my prayers, quote, unquote, do you understand what I'm saying?

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,200
And we understand that when these disciples come and they say, teach us to, when this

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,280
disciple, really, they were all there, but there was one of them that comes and says,

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,080
teach us to pray.

145
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,900
He says, as John also taught his disciples.

146
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,340
We don't have all of the record of that, but evidently John the Baptist has taught his

147
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,979
disciples with regard to the subject of prayer.

148
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:18,539
And so this disciple, as he observed the Lord Jesus Christ, engaged in prayer.

149
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:28,820
When Jesus finished praying, he says, Lord, teach us to pray.

150
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,219
The request of the disciples, number two, the response of the Lord.

151
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:41,500
I love that the Lord Jesus Christ responds to the disciples in answering their question.

152
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,719
Answering this disciple's question, Lord, teach us to pray.

153
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:55,099
And he said unto them, see, the reality is that I believe that this is a request that

154
00:11:55,099 --> 00:12:00,739
is made in verse number one that Jesus delighted in answering.

155
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,380
He understood the importance of prayer.

156
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,059
He's God, but he's praying.

157
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,979
He had a certain place.

158
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:10,460
If you go over to the book of John, we won't take time to do that, but you remember during

159
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,260
the trial and all that takes place and when they're going to come and get him, there was

160
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,380
a Judas knew of the place.

161
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,840
Jesus had a place.

162
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,979
And we find here in the text of Scripture that Jesus, he, in verse number two, it says,

163
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,219
and he said unto them.

164
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:35,500
Now, consider with me that in verse number one of chapter 11, the Bible says this, that

165
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,780
Jesus, it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased, one of

166
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,859
his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray.

167
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:54,500
And then it says in verse number two, and he said unto them.

168
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,299
Not unto him, but unto them.

169
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,940
Why?

170
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,580
Because the request of the one was something that all of them needed to hear.

171
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,419
Amen?

172
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:14,739
Because this matter of prayer is a vital importance to the people of God.

173
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:18,539
It's a unique privilege to pray.

174
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:24,260
I know we speak often, I've preached I don't know how many messages over the last nine

175
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,979
and a half years on the subject matter of prayer.

176
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:33,419
I don't know how many times it comes up through the portions of Scripture and books of the

177
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,580
Bible that I've taught and preached through.

178
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,619
But the reality is that this is something that we regularly need to revisit.

179
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:46,900
Because our prayer life is so vital.

180
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:55,260
And we see here that the Bible says, he said unto them, when ye pray.

181
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
When ye pray.

182
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,539
Now, he did not say if you pray.

183
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,099
He said when you pray.

184
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:08,419
Now, if you think this evening that the subject matter before us is not as significant as

185
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:15,380
it is that I'm portraying it to be and not as needful, I would encourage you to recognize

186
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,140
that broadly speaking within some of the best churches across the land of this nation, their

187
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,979
least attended service of the week is prayer meeting.

188
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:31,260
It's the case for us.

189
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,419
The least attended service is prayer meeting.

190
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:37,419
Prayer meeting.

191
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,179
We're to be a house of prayer.

192
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,979
Our God hears and answers prayer.

193
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:48,260
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

194
00:14:48,380 --> 00:15:01,260
But yet, too many, far too many of God's people for far too long have placed little emphasis

195
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,900
on the prayer meeting.

196
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,140
Many of you have read about C.H. Spurgeon, great preacher of yesteryear.

197
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,900
London England had the opportunity to go to the Metropolitan Tabernacle several years ago

198
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,219
when we visited England.

199
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:23,260
And I made a request when we went into that Metropolitan Tabernacle, I did not understand

200
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,580
the recent history of things that had taken place since the end of Spurgeon's ministry

201
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,900
and all that had taken place with the church.

202
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,500
But I made this request of the gentleman in the bookstore, I have read and I have heard

203
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,299
and perhaps you have as well, that there was a place under the pulpit where Spurgeon preached

204
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,380
in the basement that he called the Power Room.

205
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,659
And every time that he would preach, there were about a hundred to a hundred and twenty

206
00:15:50,659 --> 00:16:00,219
people that were in that place praying, praying during the message.

207
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:07,099
And he often would say that it was the answer of the prayers of those people that allowed

208
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:12,900
for the Word of God to go so powerfully from the pulpit of that church.

209
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,700
I did not know that the church had been decreased significantly in size.

210
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,099
The building at some point, they thought they were going to have to sell the entire building,

211
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:28,020
but they were able to do some modifications and they had sold the back part of the building

212
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,820
and they had some big reconstruction projects that had taken place.

213
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,780
Really the place in which the pulpit sits today at the Metropolitan Tabernacle is far

214
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,460
removed from where it was when Spurgeon was pastoring there.

215
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,820
And so it was not possible for me to go into the basement of that room and to see that

216
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
place, though I made the request.

217
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,619
The man at the bookstore knew exactly what I was speaking of, but wherever that quote

218
00:16:55,619 --> 00:17:00,859
unquote location would be, would be in another building at this particular time.

219
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:05,579
What I'm saying is that prayer is important.

220
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,140
The disciples, of all the things they could ask the Lord Jesus Christ to teach them, teach

221
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,900
us to pray.

222
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,939
Teach us to pray.

223
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:28,140
And Jesus said unto them, when ye pray, and he says, say, our Father which art in heaven,

224
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,739
I'm not going to read the entire thing.

225
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:35,219
I will just say this, kind of a preview to next week's lesson.

226
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:40,780
You understand that it starts out by saying, our Father which art in heaven.

227
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,540
Obviously, through the way in which it begins, it helps us to understand the place in which

228
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
he resides.

229
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
Sure, that's fine.

230
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
That's understood.

231
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,300
But I want you to think about the relationship that is revealed.

232
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,540
Our Father.

233
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,380
What gives me the opportunity to pray is that I'm a child of God.

234
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,180
That I belong to him.

235
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,819
John 1 and verse number 12, but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become

236
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,900
the sons of God.

237
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:18,420
And so because I have relationship with God, I can go into the presence of God as his child.

238
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,040
Our Father, which art in heaven.

239
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,839
And this evening, when we see this statement, when he says, when he said unto them, when

240
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:37,000
ye pray, I believe that the request of this disciple, and the response of the Lord to

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,780
the disciples, the verbiage that is selected, you understand that every word of God is pure.

242
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,060
And when Jesus responded by saying, when ye pray, what is he communicating to them?

243
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,300
This is something you're going to do, right?

244
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,979
If you ask me how to do something, I say, well, if you do that, if you happen to go

245
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:03,979
here…

246
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,380
In fact, I shared with somebody that we were going to go to a certain destination.

247
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,859
They said, oh man, if you're going to go there, you should do this.

248
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,939
The reservations are made, now they could say, when you go there, do this.

249
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:21,979
Jesus is saying, when ye pray.

250
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:32,300
And I wonder this evening, as we just… it's a simple thought, but sometimes it's these

251
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:40,900
simple things of the Christian life that we can kind of overlook.

252
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,939
And you understand tonight, the devil doesn't want you to pray.

253
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:48,099
No, he doesn't want you to pray.

254
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:51,500
The early church, they prayed.

255
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,060
They prayed.

256
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,939
They prayed together.

257
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:58,180
They saw amazing answers to prayer.

258
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:06,979
We've read in Colossians 1, the content of the prayer for the Colossians that Paul prayed.

259
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:12,739
As we studied a couple of weeks ago on Sunday morning, and this evening, I just want us

260
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:20,760
to focus upon this simple yet profound request of the disciples.

261
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,739
And then I'd like for us to just personally evaluate our own prayer life, not only tonight,

262
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:27,739
but this week.

263
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:31,380
How's my prayer life?

264
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Someone…

265
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,939
There's a lot of quotes out there about prayer.

266
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,939
You can look it up.

267
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:40,739
You can find all kinds of cute little sayings about prayer.

268
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,819
Should be our first response, not our last resort.

269
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:49,219
Do we treat prayer like we treat maybe a spare tire?

270
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,339
I don't even have a spare tire in my car.

271
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,540
It's a bad deal, isn't it?

272
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
I honestly don't.

273
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,819
In my car, there's no spare tire.

274
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:02,579
But if you have a spare tire, how often do you check it?

275
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:05,660
When do you check if your spare tire is good?

276
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,859
Jared, how long have you had your car?

277
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:11,859
Have you ever checked it?

278
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,900
Do you even have one?

279
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Are you sure?

280
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah?

281
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,540
I thought I had one too, and then I found out I don't.

282
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,140
Thankfully, I didn't have a flat tire.

283
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,300
Sam, how often do you check your spare tire?

284
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Every day.

285
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
He is such a…

286
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,020
This guy over here, man.

287
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,260
Just so you folks on livestream know, he's lying.

288
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,579
Every day.

289
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,339
Honestly though, you know when you check your spare tire?

290
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,900
When you need it.

291
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
When you need it.

292
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,339
Is that how we pray?

293
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:53,339
We just need something.

294
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,339
We're in a pickle.

295
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:55,339
We've got a problem.

296
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,900
Oh God, we need you to do something.

297
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,060
We're in a mess.

298
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
We pray.

299
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,619
That's not how it should be.

300
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,300
We should pray.

301
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,339
The Bible says, pray without ceasing.

302
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:12,339
Be in that spirit of prayer.

303
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:21,780
But the disciples, they say, Lord, sorry, one disciple says, Lord, teach us to pray.

304
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,500
We're going to have to spend more time in prayer on Wednesday nights.

305
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,140
I think it's important.

306
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,579
And I hope that we would take the simple truth of the Word of God over the next several

307
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:42,459
weeks as we study through the passage, and that we'd allow God to give us a revival

308
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:46,859
of prayer.

309
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,380
Somebody said this, the only place, again, another cute little saying about prayer.

310
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:58,739
The only place power comes before prayer is the dictionary.

311
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:03,300
The only place power comes before prayer is the dictionary.

312
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:11,020
John R. Rice was famously known as saying, much prayer, much power.

313
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,839
Little prayer, little power.

314
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,780
No prayer, no power.

315
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:30,099
We have a unique privilege in all that we would not take it lightly, overlook it, but

316
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:37,739
that we would truly say, God, would you help me to have a revival in my prayer life?

317
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:40,439
Because God hears and answers prayer.

318
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,020
He hears and answers prayer.

319
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,180
We need a revival of prayer in our homes, in our church.

320
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Revival of prayer.

321
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:49,579
Let's pray.

322
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:50,579
Father, we love you.

323
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:51,579
Thank you for loving us.

324
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,060
I pray that you'd bless our time.

325
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,699
I pray that the folks that are tuned in on live stream this evening, I pray that they

326
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:05,180
would take the prayer bulletin that was emailed to them, that they would get together if they're

327
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,459
by themselves, they would spend time in prayer if they're with their family, that they would

328
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:14,699
get together and pray, just as we will here at the church house.

329
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:21,300
