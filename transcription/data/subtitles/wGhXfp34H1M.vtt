WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.199
And Luke chapter 11, and for the next several Wednesday evenings, we're going to study through

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:08.479
this portion of Scripture.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.600
And if you say, well, I thought we were studying through the Leviticus, I did too, but the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.879
Holy Spirit and God is in control, and He has led me, I believe, thoroughly believe,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.459
to deal with this subject matter over the next several weeks.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:28.299
And really, the passage that is before us is a familiar passage.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:35.240
The subject of prayer is a subject that has been often discussed, probably, for each of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.959
us as the people of God, if we'd be honest before the Lord and transparent with ourselves,

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:47.880
we would say that it's this area of our lives that needs the most regular evaluation, the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.479
area of our prayer life.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:01:00.459
And the reality is that we need a revival of prayer in our personal lives, in our homes,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.459
in our churches.

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:07.660
The Lord Jesus Christ said that the church was to be a house of prayer.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.059
If you look across the landscape of our nation, you find that the house of God, quote-unquote,

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.379
has become an entertainment house.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.379
It's unfortunate.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.319
It's to be a house of prayer.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.559
I will be honest and transparent with you this evening that two of the last three Sunday

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:32.440
mornings as we've been teaching and preaching through the book of Colossians, the subject

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.199
matter has been on prayer.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:41.199
And God has used those portions of Scripture as I have had the opportunity not only to

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:47.000
prepare them and meditate upon them as I would prepare the messages, but then even as I would

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.319
deliver the messages, God has used the truths of those passages to encourage me, yes, but

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.459
to convict me greatly.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.379
And I hope that God's Word convicts you in your life as well.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:04.819
It's supposed to.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.779
Conviction's a good thing, amen?

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:11.339
Sometimes we look at conviction as being a bad thing, but the reality is that it's good

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.740
for me to be convicted when I read and study the Word of God, when I hear the Word of God

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:21.000
preached and taught for the Holy Spirit of God to use the Word of God to speak to the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.639
heart of man.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.520
That's a precious thing.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.960
And the reality is that as we've studied those portions of Scripture, the conviction I would

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.520
say that I've experienced personally, I hope that you too, as you've listened to those

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.199
messages and allowed the Holy Spirit of God to use His Word in your life, I hope that

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.979
perhaps we would evaluate our lives and say, how is my prayer life?

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.360
How is my prayer life?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.039
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message this evening,

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.000
teach us to pray.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Teach us to pray.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.800
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.279
And over the next several weeks, we're going to go little by little through this passage

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:13.839
of Scripture, and we will learn, hopefully, what it is that God wants us to learn from

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.880
this portion of Scripture, but as we would learn this, the important thing of prayer

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.300
is not to simply be able to talk about prayer.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.919
The reality is that many people can talk about the subject of prayer.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:35.039
In fact, I would say this, it is easier for me to preach or teach a message on prayer

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.600
than to pray.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.160
It is.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.440
It is easier to teach about prayer, to preach about prayer, than it is to actually engage

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.000
in prayer.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.259
Why is that?

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.720
Because prayer is a spiritual battle.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.320
And the reality this evening is that as we look at this familiar passage of Scripture,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:08.160
the Bible tells us, and it came to pass in Luke 11, and it came to pass, notice this,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.199
that as He was praying in a certain place, the He is Jesus.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:19.920
The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, God in flesh, He is praying, He's in a certain

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.600
place, and no doubt as we would look at the passage of Scripture and we'd understand what's

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.880
taking place, we'd have to conclude that the disciples had observed what was taking

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880
place.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.239
The disciples saw the Lord Jesus Christ engaged in prayer.

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:45.559
For the Bible tells us that He was praying in a certain place, notice this, when He ceased,

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:58.000
one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.399
We'll only get into the first part of verse number two this evening because we're going

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:06.839
to take little snippets of this passage of Scripture over the next several weeks and

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.720
spend some time studying the Word of God, and then most importantly spend some time

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.799
implementing the truth of the Word of God and praying.

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:20.440
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, I would simply say this, number one, the request

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440
of the disciples.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.720
You say, well, this is a pretty easy outline, I agree.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.760
But as we think about the request of the disciples, we understand that they only make the request

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.200
because of what they observed.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.640
If they did not observe the Lord Jesus Christ praying, no doubt they wouldn't have said,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.899
teach us to pray.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:45.660
But they observed the Lord Jesus Christ engaged in prayer, which leads to one of the disciples

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.420
saying to the Lord, teach us to pray.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.859
It's a simple yet profound request.

00:05:56.859 --> 00:06:00.619
They recognized the position of Jesus Christ.

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:08.140
You know in the passage that the disciples said unto Him, Lord, He is Lord, Lord, teach

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.820
us to pray.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.980
Have you ever considered how many things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.339
them?

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:24.779
Honestly, how many things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach them?

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:31.040
What we have recorded in the Word of God is but one request from the disciples with regard

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.859
to what they desire Jesus to teach them, and it's here.

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:39.660
Teach us to pray.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.500
They had seen Jesus, they had heard Jesus, maybe it would be a better way to say it,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.260
they had heard Jesus teach, no doubt, and preach.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.779
But they never said, Lord, teach us to preach.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:54.940
We don't read it in the Scriptures.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.700
They never said, Lord, teach us how to teach.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.200
They'd seen the Lord perform a number of miracles.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.559
They never said, Lord, teach us how to do these miracles.

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:13.559
They had the opportunity to see the Lord Jesus Christ heal many people.

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:17.079
They never said, Lord, teach us how to heal.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:24.519
But when they observed the Lord Jesus Christ in prayer, they said, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:30.959
I wonder this evening if we would think about the subject specifically of the first statement

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:36.359
that I made with regard to hearing the Lord Jesus Christ teach and preach, and I'll use

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:43.239
this because it fits for me personally as the application, if I would learn to pray

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:50.399
as I ought to pray, the teaching and preaching would be power-filled by the Holy Spirit of

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.239
God.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:53.760
I need to learn how to pray.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.239
The disciples need to learn how to pray.

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.480
Teach us to pray.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:04.679
As we think about the request of these disciples and we think about the fact that the Word

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:10.079
of God in all of the Gospel accounts, as the record is given, that we have in Holy Scripture

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:17.839
of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, these disciples make this simple request.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.480
Simple yet profound.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.920
You note with me in the text of Scripture that they say, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.440
They don't say, Lord, teach us how to pray.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.919
It's not a formula that we pray.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.359
The reality is the passage of Scripture that is before us, coupled with, if you were to

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:42.159
go to Matthew chapter number 6 and look at the record of Matthew 6 of this same account

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:48.320
that is given, you will find that many people within the broad category of Christendom have

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.559
referred to this passage as the Lord's Prayer.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:59.880
And unfortunately, there are many people groups, the religions, organized religions,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.599
that would pray verbatim the words of this passage of Scripture.

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:05.640
They've memorized it.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.880
It's just a memorized prayer.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.080
Jesus did not tell His disciples to pray this prayer.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.359
They did not ask to teach us how to pray, though Jesus would give them instruction on

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:25.200
how to pray, but teach us to pray.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:36.080
If we're not careful, if I'm not careful, sometimes prayer can become just rote religion.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.479
Just a religious exercise that we've kind of memorized some little kind of a prayer.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:48.559
Maybe it's not the same type of memorized prayer that some denomination uses, but for

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:55.359
us, we have our Baptist memorized prayers, if you will, and it's very possible for us

00:09:55.359 --> 00:10:01.280
to just kind of get into a routine, if you will, where we're almost on autopilot.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.520
You ever get on autopilot in your life?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520
Let me ask you this.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.799
Is there a place, maybe, I know we're kind of different now because of driving not as

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:14.880
much with people working from home and what have you, but is there ever a time, if you

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.039
can think way back to 2019 when you would drive to and from work every day, has there

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:26.400
been a time that you've been so just on autopilot that you're driving and you go through a few

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.400
intersections, you know, I don't even know if that light was green or not.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.840
I mean, I'm pretty sure it was green.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840
Have you been there?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.559
You're just on autopilot.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:41.520
Can I tell you if we're not careful, we can do that in our prayer life, that it just becomes

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520
routine.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.080
It just becomes, this is my prayers.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.000
I'm saying my prayers, quote, unquote, do you understand what I'm saying?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.200
And we understand that when these disciples come and they say, teach us to, when this

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.280
disciple, really, they were all there, but there was one of them that comes and says,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.080
teach us to pray.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.900
He says, as John also taught his disciples.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.340
We don't have all of the record of that, but evidently John the Baptist has taught his

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.979
disciples with regard to the subject of prayer.

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:18.539
And so this disciple, as he observed the Lord Jesus Christ, engaged in prayer.

00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:28.820
When Jesus finished praying, he says, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:34.219
The request of the disciples, number two, the response of the Lord.

00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:41.500
I love that the Lord Jesus Christ responds to the disciples in answering their question.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.719
Answering this disciple's question, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:55.099
And he said unto them, see, the reality is that I believe that this is a request that

00:11:55.099 --> 00:12:00.739
is made in verse number one that Jesus delighted in answering.

00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:02.380
He understood the importance of prayer.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.059
He's God, but he's praying.

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.979
He had a certain place.

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.460
If you go over to the book of John, we won't take time to do that, but you remember during

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.260
the trial and all that takes place and when they're going to come and get him, there was

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.380
a Judas knew of the place.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.840
Jesus had a place.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.979
And we find here in the text of Scripture that Jesus, he, in verse number two, it says,

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:29.219
and he said unto them.

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:35.500
Now, consider with me that in verse number one of chapter 11, the Bible says this, that

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.780
Jesus, it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased, one of

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.859
his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:54.500
And then it says in verse number two, and he said unto them.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.299
Not unto him, but unto them.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.940
Why?

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.580
Because the request of the one was something that all of them needed to hear.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.419
Amen?

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:14.739
Because this matter of prayer is a vital importance to the people of God.

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:18.539
It's a unique privilege to pray.

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:24.260
I know we speak often, I've preached I don't know how many messages over the last nine

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.979
and a half years on the subject matter of prayer.

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:33.419
I don't know how many times it comes up through the portions of Scripture and books of the

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:36.580
Bible that I've taught and preached through.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.619
But the reality is that this is something that we regularly need to revisit.

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:46.900
Because our prayer life is so vital.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:55.260
And we see here that the Bible says, he said unto them, when ye pray.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.260
When ye pray.

00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:00.539
Now, he did not say if you pray.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.099
He said when you pray.

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:08.419
Now, if you think this evening that the subject matter before us is not as significant as

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:15.380
it is that I'm portraying it to be and not as needful, I would encourage you to recognize

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:22.140
that broadly speaking within some of the best churches across the land of this nation, their

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.979
least attended service of the week is prayer meeting.

00:14:27.979 --> 00:14:31.260
It's the case for us.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.419
The least attended service is prayer meeting.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:37.419
Prayer meeting.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:40.179
We're to be a house of prayer.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.979
Our God hears and answers prayer.

00:14:42.979 --> 00:14:48.260
He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:15:01.260
But yet, too many, far too many of God's people for far too long have placed little emphasis

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.900
on the prayer meeting.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:11.140
Many of you have read about C.H. Spurgeon, great preacher of yesteryear.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.900
London England had the opportunity to go to the Metropolitan Tabernacle several years ago

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.219
when we visited England.

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:23.260
And I made a request when we went into that Metropolitan Tabernacle, I did not understand

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.580
the recent history of things that had taken place since the end of Spurgeon's ministry

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.900
and all that had taken place with the church.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.500
But I made this request of the gentleman in the bookstore, I have read and I have heard

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:42.299
and perhaps you have as well, that there was a place under the pulpit where Spurgeon preached

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:46.380
in the basement that he called the Power Room.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.659
And every time that he would preach, there were about a hundred to a hundred and twenty

00:15:50.659 --> 00:16:00.219
people that were in that place praying, praying during the message.

00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:07.099
And he often would say that it was the answer of the prayers of those people that allowed

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:12.900
for the Word of God to go so powerfully from the pulpit of that church.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:18.700
I did not know that the church had been decreased significantly in size.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.099
The building at some point, they thought they were going to have to sell the entire building,

00:16:22.099 --> 00:16:28.020
but they were able to do some modifications and they had sold the back part of the building

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.820
and they had some big reconstruction projects that had taken place.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.780
Really the place in which the pulpit sits today at the Metropolitan Tabernacle is far

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:43.460
removed from where it was when Spurgeon was pastoring there.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.820
And so it was not possible for me to go into the basement of that room and to see that

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.820
place, though I made the request.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:55.619
The man at the bookstore knew exactly what I was speaking of, but wherever that quote

00:16:55.619 --> 00:17:00.859
unquote location would be, would be in another building at this particular time.

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:05.579
What I'm saying is that prayer is important.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:12.140
The disciples, of all the things they could ask the Lord Jesus Christ to teach them, teach

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.900
us to pray.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.939
Teach us to pray.

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:28.140
And Jesus said unto them, when ye pray, and he says, say, our Father which art in heaven,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.739
I'm not going to read the entire thing.

00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:35.219
I will just say this, kind of a preview to next week's lesson.

00:17:35.219 --> 00:17:40.780
You understand that it starts out by saying, our Father which art in heaven.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.540
Obviously, through the way in which it begins, it helps us to understand the place in which

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.540
he resides.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.540
Sure, that's fine.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.540
That's understood.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.300
But I want you to think about the relationship that is revealed.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.540
Our Father.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.380
What gives me the opportunity to pray is that I'm a child of God.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.180
That I belong to him.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.819
John 1 and verse number 12, but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.900
the sons of God.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:18.420
And so because I have relationship with God, I can go into the presence of God as his child.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.040
Our Father, which art in heaven.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.839
And this evening, when we see this statement, when he says, when he said unto them, when

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:37.000
ye pray, I believe that the request of this disciple, and the response of the Lord to

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.780
the disciples, the verbiage that is selected, you understand that every word of God is pure.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:55.060
And when Jesus responded by saying, when ye pray, what is he communicating to them?

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.300
This is something you're going to do, right?

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.979
If you ask me how to do something, I say, well, if you do that, if you happen to go

00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:03.979
here…

00:19:03.979 --> 00:19:06.380
In fact, I shared with somebody that we were going to go to a certain destination.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:12.859
They said, oh man, if you're going to go there, you should do this.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:17.939
The reservations are made, now they could say, when you go there, do this.

00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:21.979
Jesus is saying, when ye pray.

00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:32.300
And I wonder this evening, as we just… it's a simple thought, but sometimes it's these

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:40.900
simple things of the Christian life that we can kind of overlook.

00:19:40.939 --> 00:19:43.939
And you understand tonight, the devil doesn't want you to pray.

00:19:43.939 --> 00:19:48.099
No, he doesn't want you to pray.

00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:51.500
The early church, they prayed.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.060
They prayed.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.939
They prayed together.

00:19:54.939 --> 00:19:58.180
They saw amazing answers to prayer.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:06.979
We've read in Colossians 1, the content of the prayer for the Colossians that Paul prayed.

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:12.739
As we studied a couple of weeks ago on Sunday morning, and this evening, I just want us

00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:20.760
to focus upon this simple yet profound request of the disciples.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.739
And then I'd like for us to just personally evaluate our own prayer life, not only tonight,

00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:27.739
but this week.

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:31.380
How's my prayer life?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.380
Someone…

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.939
There's a lot of quotes out there about prayer.

00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:35.939
You can look it up.

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:40.739
You can find all kinds of cute little sayings about prayer.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.819
Should be our first response, not our last resort.

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:49.219
Do we treat prayer like we treat maybe a spare tire?

00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:51.339
I don't even have a spare tire in my car.

00:20:51.339 --> 00:20:53.540
It's a bad deal, isn't it?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.540
I honestly don't.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.819
In my car, there's no spare tire.

00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:02.579
But if you have a spare tire, how often do you check it?

00:21:02.579 --> 00:21:05.660
When do you check if your spare tire is good?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.859
Jared, how long have you had your car?

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:11.859
Have you ever checked it?

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:13.900
Do you even have one?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.900
Are you sure?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900
Yeah?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.540
I thought I had one too, and then I found out I don't.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.140
Thankfully, I didn't have a flat tire.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.300
Sam, how often do you check your spare tire?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.300
Every day.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.300
He is such a…

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.020
This guy over here, man.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:35.260
Just so you folks on livestream know, he's lying.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.579
Every day.

00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:43.339
Honestly though, you know when you check your spare tire?

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:45.900
When you need it.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.900
When you need it.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:52.339
Is that how we pray?

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:53.339
We just need something.

00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:54.339
We're in a pickle.

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:55.339
We've got a problem.

00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:58.900
Oh God, we need you to do something.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.060
We're in a mess.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060
We pray.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.619
That's not how it should be.

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.300
We should pray.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.339
The Bible says, pray without ceasing.

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:12.339
Be in that spirit of prayer.

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:21.780
But the disciples, they say, Lord, sorry, one disciple says, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.500
We're going to have to spend more time in prayer on Wednesday nights.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.140
I think it's important.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.579
And I hope that we would take the simple truth of the Word of God over the next several

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:42.459
weeks as we study through the passage, and that we'd allow God to give us a revival

00:22:42.459 --> 00:22:46.859
of prayer.

00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:51.380
Somebody said this, the only place, again, another cute little saying about prayer.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:58.739
The only place power comes before prayer is the dictionary.

00:22:58.739 --> 00:23:03.300
The only place power comes before prayer is the dictionary.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:11.020
John R. Rice was famously known as saying, much prayer, much power.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.839
Little prayer, little power.

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:18.780
No prayer, no power.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:30.099
We have a unique privilege in all that we would not take it lightly, overlook it, but

00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:37.739
that we would truly say, God, would you help me to have a revival in my prayer life?

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:40.439
Because God hears and answers prayer.

00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:42.020
He hears and answers prayer.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.180
We need a revival of prayer in our homes, in our church.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.180
Revival of prayer.

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:49.579
Let's pray.

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:50.579
Father, we love you.

00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:51.579
Thank you for loving us.

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:54.060
I pray that you'd bless our time.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.699
I pray that the folks that are tuned in on live stream this evening, I pray that they

00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:05.180
would take the prayer bulletin that was emailed to them, that they would get together if they're

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.459
by themselves, they would spend time in prayer if they're with their family, that they would

00:24:08.459 --> 00:24:14.699
get together and pray, just as we will here at the church house.

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:21.300
If I pray, you'd give us a revival of prayer.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.260
I pray that you'd work as only you can.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.459
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:31.819
Let's take our prayer bulletin and review some.
