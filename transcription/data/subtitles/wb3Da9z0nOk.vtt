00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
That blessed my heart and I just want to, glad to have the opportunity to share it with

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.380
you this evening.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.860
Did everyone get a prayer bulletin?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.439
If you didn't, please snag one.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.680
In the middle, there's a half piece of paper.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.879
We'll get to it in just a minute, but I just wanted to let you know it's hiding in there

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:17.879
for you.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.040
It's a late Christmas present, all right?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.899
But I want to open up with just one verse from Genesis, chapter 22, and this is the

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:34.259
account of Abraham and Isaac, and they're heading up to Mount Moriah where Isaac is

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.259
to be offered, but he doesn't know it.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:45.659
And the Bible says in Genesis 22, verse 7, Isaac turns to his father, Abraham, and the

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.799
Bible says, and Isaac spake unto Abraham, his father, and said, My father, and he said,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.599
Where am I, my son?

00:00:53.599 --> 00:01:02.119
And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.599
Let's open in a word of prayer.

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:08.160
Dear Heavenly Father, Lord, Lord, it's been a busy week.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.080
Lord, there's a lot of things.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.319
I know folks may be tired tonight.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.559
Our minds may be on a million other things, but Lord, I pray that you would just, Lord,

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:23.800
let us put all those things out of our mind, open our ears, open our hearts, and Lord,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.440
I pray that the message you would have for us to hear tonight would come through.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.000
I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.980
Here we have a very familiar account of the sacrifice on Mount Moriah between Abraham

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.260
and Isaac, and the Old Testament is filled with many different offerings and sacrifices.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.459
You can go all the way back to Genesis chapter 4 with Cain and Abel, the very first offering.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.099
You know, when Abel brought his offering and God honored it, vice Cain, and you go through

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:04.220
Noah, we read in Genesis 8, Noah offered sacrifices to the Lord.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.580
In Genesis 8.20, the Bible says, and Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and took of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.259
every clean beast and every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:19.460
You read about offerings in Job, he offered sacrifices, and Jacob.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.220
And it's not until you get to the book of Exodus and Leviticus that God actually lays

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.259
out specific guidance for the different sacrifices and when and why they were to be offered.

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.619
And if you're like me, if you're going through your Bible reading and you come to Leviticus,

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:39.779
all right, and you're starting to read through all of these different sacrifices and offerings,

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.240
it's like, oh, this is horrible, right?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.399
And you go back, it's like a Burger King menu.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:50.800
You read about national offerings and individual offerings.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.160
There's sin offerings, burnt offerings of different types.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.880
There's meat offerings, which the word meat in our King James Version means food.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.259
And if you look, it's not actual meat, it's bread and grain.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.679
And there's drink offerings.

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.520
There's offerings for different occasions.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.520
There's ceremonial offerings at different festivals.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.399
If you were to dedicate a house, there was an offering that you would bring or the birth

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.279
of a child.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:23.800
And if you're like me, it's pretty easy to read over those passages and just to think,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
well, you know what?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.080
That was the Old Testament.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.360
That was awesome for them.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.199
And there's not really much here for me.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.520
As a matter of fact, the Bible says that all of that is in the past.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.240
In Luke 16, 16, the Bible says, the law and the prophets were until John.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.759
Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.619
So I know that the law, the ceremonial law doesn't apply to me.

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.119
So can't I just skip over those passages?

00:03:53.119 --> 00:04:00.399
I mean, what does it really help me besides knowing that they did them?

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:08.279
Well, I was reminded in 2 Timothy 3, 16, the Bible says, all scripture is given by inspiration

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:18.839
of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, correction, for instruction in righteousness.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.399
Even Leviticus?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.920
Yes.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920
How?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.920
You may be asking, and that's the point of the short, very short message tonight is when

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.720
we look back at the sacrifices, we see a beautiful picture.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.500
You know, when Christ was on, during his three years, his earthly ministry, he taught.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.959
And most of the time when he was teaching, what did he use?

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:47.959
Parables, right?

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:53.480
Pictures, word pictures, so that you could understand something that you can't see, the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.679
kingdom of God, salvation, all right?

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:58.359
Being born again, you can't really see that.

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:01.200
So he would take things that you could see, all right?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.119
So do you understand dirt?

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:04.359
You understand what dirt is?

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:05.359
All right.

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:07.079
Dirt, that is your heart.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:12.559
And he would use a parable to explain something that you couldn't see with your eyes.

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:19.359
And here we have, as we look back into the Old Testament, we know that these sacrifices

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:25.600
and these offerings from Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1, the Bible says, for the law having

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:36.040
a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things, all right, can never

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.839
with these sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.799
perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered.

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:48.519
Here the Bible is saying, yeah, look back at all those sacrifices and offerings that

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.519
they were done.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.519
They were just a shadow.

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.359
They were just a picture.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:58.320
And I realize that we often will understand, especially if you've been in church for a

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.279
little bit, you'll understand, oh, yeah, you know, they had a sacrifice in that picture

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.839
of the coming of Jesus Christ to offer himself on the cross to wash away our sins.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:08.839
And it's true.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:14.040
There was a sin offering in the Old Testament, but there were many others.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.279
What about all those other ones?

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.519
Do they mean anything?

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.119
Was it just something that they did?

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:27.399
Well, I would like you to shift your focus now to the New Testament, and I want to talk

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:31.399
about some New Testament offerings.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:41.160
In 1 Peter 2, verse 9, the Bible says, but ye, Christians, believers, sons and daughters

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:49.640
of God, but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.880
people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.679
into his marvelous light.

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:06.040
And in Revelation 1, verse 5, it says, unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:14.959
in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.600
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
Amen.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
What does that mean?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.119
Well, when we look back in the Old Testament, there were kings and there were priests, people

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:30.920
that were specifically chosen to go into the temple, to stand before God, and to serve

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920
the Lord.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.799
But here, God is calling us priests.

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:40.079
You, if you're sitting here and you know the Lord as your Savior, God is calling you a

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:42.279
king and a priest.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.279
Why?

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:47.000
Well, as a king, we are adopted into the family.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.279
We are the sons and the daughters of the king of kings, and we will reign with him.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.320
That's not a figure of speech.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.799
We literally will reign.

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:59.420
You and I are of the kingdom.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.820
He calls us kings, and we're priests because, like the Old Testament priests, we have access

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.380
to God.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.299
In the Old Testament times, not everyone had that privilege.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:14.739
It was only a select few who could come before the Lord, who could offer the sacrifices.

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:18.119
But today, every one of us can.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:23.179
We have free access to come before the Lord.

00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:32.659
Additionally, as priests in 1 Peter 2.5, we're commanded to bring sacrifices.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.099
In 1 Peter 2.5, the Bible says,

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:40.299
"...Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:46.820
up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:53.820
What are some of the sacrifices today that God wants us to bring to Him?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.820
Anyone?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.820
Anyone come to mind?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.820
What's that?

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.820
Praise?

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.820
Yeah.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.820
How about our bodies, Romans 12.1?

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.820
Yeah, our life.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.820
In Romans, it says,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.739
"...We teach you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:15.820
bodies a living sacrifice."

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.820
Praise, Hebrews 13.15,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.820
"...By Him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually."

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.820
Mercy, in Hebrews 13.16, the next verse,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.820
"...But to do good and to communicate, forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased."

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.820
It goes on here.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.820
So, I see that, I get it.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.820
We're called priests because we have access to God.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.820
But if I look back in the Old Testament, the priests and all those sacrifices and offerings

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.820
that they brought, is there a connection between all of those?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.820
Is there an actual picture that I can look at and be like,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.820
Oh, now I get it.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:06.300
now I understand what God wants to be happening in my life?" And the answer is

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:12.120
yes, and specifically we're going to look at three types of sacrifices, and these

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:21.420
are from Exodus 29, and these are the sacrifices that the priests brought for

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.380
them to be consecrated or set apart for the Lord. These were the sacrifices that

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.460
the priest had to do in order to come to the point where they were set apart,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.580
where they were sanctified and consecrated for the Lord. We, as New

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.780
Testament priests, can learn by looking back at the Old Testament picture, okay?

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:46.740
And what are these three types? There's three groups here. There's actually four

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.540
sacrifices on the little handout that I gave you, and I'm not going to read

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.260
through all the verses, but I just want to skim over. In Exodus chapter 29, verses

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.420
10 through 14, the Bible talks about a bullock being brought, and this was

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.220
specifically for a sin offering. In verse 14, the Bible says,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.020
"...but the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:16.580
fire without the camp." It is a sin offering, and I have a copy of that, too.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.060
I just want to look at this, make sure I'm following along with you guys. The sin

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.580
offering, picture of salvation, the forgiveness of our sins, that came first.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.940
That came first, and if you're curious for more, you can read the first five

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:41.780
chapters of Leviticus, and they expound these sacrifices. But that one

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:48.380
came first. The second one was the burnt offering, verses 15 through 18, and this

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:55.360
was a ram, and it was a burnt offering. That means all of it was burned on the

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.580
altar. Nothing was left. All of it was burned, and this is a beautiful picture

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:09.660
of surrender. All of our hearts offered up to the Lord. And then came, verses 19

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:15.380
through 33, it was a second ram, and also bread, grain. It was the meat offering,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.700
which pictured service. They didn't bring all of it,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.940
they brought some of it to the Lord, and some of it they enjoyed themselves. And

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:35.300
also the peace offering, picturing the beautiful peace of God that we can have

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.940
with him in fellowship. Where some of it was offered on the altar, and some of it

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:48.100
was eaten by the giver. It's a beautiful picture of having supper. Some of it was

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.500
given to the Lord, and some of it, the offer that the person giving it got to

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.500
enjoy themselves. It was having supper together. It's a beautiful picture of

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.820
supplication, having supper, sweet fellowship. That's what it pictured. It

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.380
was a joyous time, and if you look at Leviticus, the sin offering was

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.940
mandatory. All of us must come to Christ, we must be saved, that comes first. But

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.940
the other ones were voluntary. The fellowship, maintaining that fellowship

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.020
with the Lord, if you look, these were free will offerings, all right? They were

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:30.260
given. Well, I'm reminded of Revelation 3.20, talking about supplication. The

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.340
Bible says Jesus is speaking to the church, to believers, and he's saying,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:41.260
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.660
I will come in to him and will sup with him. I want to have supper with you. I

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.020
want to have fellowship, all right? And that's the point here that God

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.980
wants us to get to, but there's a problem.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.820
Perhaps, I know I've been here, all right? Perhaps you've been here as well, perhaps

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.300
you're there right now, you're saying, hey, you know, Jeff, I get it, you know, I'm

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.740
doing these things, I'm sacrificing to the Lord, I'm giving tithes and

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.860
offerings, I'm, you know, I'm here, it's Wednesday night, I'm here in

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.860
church, I'm giving my time, all right? And I'm doing all these things, but it seems

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.860
like I'm not enjoying the peace of God, that sweet fellowship and the blessings.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.500
It just seems like something's missing. What's wrong? What am I missing here?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:42.460
And to answer that, I would like you to notice two details of these sacrifices.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:50.460
The first is the order. The first is the order of them. Salvation comes first, and

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.619
then comes the burnt offering, surrender. You know, when the Bible says, present

00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:03.339
your bodies a living sacrifice, this is a daily surrender. It's obeying God's

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:11.860
Word, it's a humbling of ourselves. Lord, I surrender my will to you. What did

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:19.020
Christ say, not my will but thine be done? It's a surrender. And when we humble

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.339
ourselves, when we surrender our will to Him, there is some beautiful things that

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:29.020
happen. In James, the Bible says, but he giveth more grace, wherefore he saith, God

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.420
resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble, the person who has

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.779
surrendered themselves to the Lord. Lord, I'm not holding anything back. I want your

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:43.899
will to be done. In James 4.10, humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:50.500
He shall lift you up. What comes after salvation? There's a surrender. There's a

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.020
surrendering of our will. There's a humbling of ourselves. And then comes

00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:03.380
service. Then comes the meat offering, all right? Then comes us doing things. You

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.059
know, service, while we still have unsurrendered areas or sins in our life,

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:12.940
will certainly lead to frustration at a minimum. And if we're not careful, it can

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:20.300
quickly lead to a bitter, unfruitful life. God, look at what I'm doing for you. Why

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.860
aren't you blessing me? Bible warns us about this in Hebrews 12. It says,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.619
looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:36.420
bitterness springing up trouble you. I've kind of summed it up this way. Works

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:43.700
without a walk leads to weariness. It's having the wrong order of the

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.660
sacrifices. It's trying to skip the burnt offering and going straight to the meat

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.700
offering and wondering why we don't have the peace of God in our life. It is

00:16:51.700 --> 00:17:02.420
the order here. But I want you to notice a second detail of the sacrifices. And I

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:09.380
was struggling to find another O word, so I used operation, all right? But when that

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.660
offering was brought to the Lord, when the sacrifice was put on the altar, how

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:23.460
was it offered up to God? Did they wave their hands in the air and voila, it was

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:37.179
offered to the Lord? What's that? It was burned. It was burned. In Exodus 29 18,

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:43.020
now shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar. Okay, it is a burnt offering. The

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.700
part that was offered up to God was burned and it was offered up to him in

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:57.540
the smoke. What is that a picture of? Deuteronomy 4 24, the Bible says,

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:10.619
for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. Hmm. In Song of

00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:18.100
Solomon 8 6, set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm. For

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:26.220
love is strong as death. Jealousy is cruel as the grave. The coals thereof are

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:33.460
coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:40.580
love, neither can the floods drown it. What is the Old Testament fire a picture

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:47.780
of? If we're to offer spiritual sacrifices today, what is spiritual fire?

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:57.020
It's love. Putting this together physically, Old Testament, if there was no

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.299
fire, there was no offering. They would bring their sacrifice and plunk, they

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:05.700
would throw it on the altar. Everyone could look at it like, oh wow, did you see

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:13.900
what they brought? But it wasn't offered to the Lord until it was burned. New

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:21.580
Testament, 1st Corinthians 13 3, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.340
poor, that sounds like a sacrifice to me. Plunk, there it is on the altar. And though

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:33.619
I give my body to be burned, that sounds like a sacrifice to me. Plunk, there's

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:44.460
another one. And have not charity, love, it profit me, it profiteth me nothing.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:50.780
Here we have a picture, bringing things, doing things, all right? But there's no

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.340
charity. We're not doing it with a love for God or a love for others. And the

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.780
Bible says, you're not offering it to me. There's no fire.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.080
fire, it's not coming up to me. Oh, you can bring it, plunk it, it's there on the altar

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:11.820
and others can look at it, all right? But it's not being offered to me. So why is it

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.220
that perhaps we ask the question, Lord, I'm doing all these things, why aren't you blessing

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.980
me? Well, number one, do we have the right order? And number two, how's your fire? You

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:34.300
know, we opened with a verse from Abraham and Isaac about Isaac asking his dad the question,

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:44.580
behold, the wood and the fire, but where's the sacrifice? I think, perhaps, I know the

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.780
Lord often answers a question with a question as a way to teach. And I think maybe the question

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:59.300
he would respond to us would be this, behold, the sacrifice and the wood, but where's the

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:06.800
fire? And that's the title for the message tonight, Where's the Fire? How is your fire

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:16.300
doing tonight? Is your passion for the Lord as hot as it should be? If it's not, would

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.620
you allow me to share with you three quick helps in closing tonight? What's the solution?

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:30.300
Perhaps our fire, our zeal, our love for the Lord has gone cold. What can we do? What are

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:37.580
some practical things we can do? Well, I have three quick helps, and I have the mnemonic.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:44.540
Hopefully this is cheesy enough for you to remember it, but it's hot, H-O-T, all right?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:50.260
The first one is put on the helmet of salvation. What does it mean to put on the helmet of

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.380
salvation? Well, if you put something on your head, the helmet, all right, that means you're

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:02.140
thinking about it. What is it that we're to be thinking about every day? What is salvation?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:09.820
It is the gift of God. It's a demonstration of His love for us. In 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:15.040
8, but let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.140
and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. In 1 John 4, 19, hopefully I'm not stealing any

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:29.940
of the pastor's verses coming up in 1 John, but he says, but the Bible says, we love Him

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:37.900
because He first loved us. My friends, if you're thoroughly convinced that God loves

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:45.100
you, it puts a zeal in your heart. It gives you a thirst and a hunger to want to know

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:53.420
more about Him. I know many of you may have remembered an old, I don't know, he was a

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.700
French guy, Victor Hugo, not a Christian, but at least he got it, the picture of love.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.180
He says, the greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved, loved for

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:17.780
ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. We can quickly get discouraged, distracted,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:25.100
and we can lose sight of how much God loves us. And when that happens, boy, it's a downward

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.380
spiral, isn't it? What's the solution? Take some time. When you put the helmet of salvation

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.260
on, you're reflecting, you're remembering all that God has done for us and what He's

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:45.580
going to do for us. What did it cost God to come to the cross to die for you and for me?

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:51.440
It cost Him everything. He gave up heaven. He came to this earth, and He was forsaken

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.940
by all. And He hung on the cross, forsaken by all those who called Him friend and master.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:06.300
They all fled. And if that wasn't enough, His own Father turned His back on Him. And

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:13.940
there He hung, utterly and completely alone. And He did all of that, not for the angels,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:21.540
not for any of the animals, not for any other created being, but you and me. Do you feel

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:31.140
special tonight? You should. You are loved. All right? How often do we forget that? We

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:36.900
need to be daily reminded of it. We need to be getting in God's Word and opening up the

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.700
love letter that He's given to us and remind ourselves how much He loves us. What's the

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.460
first thing that you can do to help rekindle that fire? Put the helmet of salvation on,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:53.820
P-H. Number two, Obey. You know, nothing will cool our hearts faster than unrepentant

00:24:53.820 --> 00:25:02.500
sin. The Bible says in Matthew 24, 12, and because iniquity shall abound, the love of

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:12.540
many shall wax cold. What happens to the fire? It's cold. All right? Because of iniquity.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:18.380
And in John 15, 10, if you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love, even as I have

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:29.900
kept my Father's commandments and abide in His love. Obey. And the last one I have for

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:44.900
you, number T, it's often been said that love is spelled T-I-M-E, time. You will spend

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:50.820
time with those that you love. You'll spend time doing the things that you love. And the

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:58.460
more time that we spend with God, number one, the more that we will be like Him. The Bible

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:05.540
says God is love. The more time that we spend in His Word, more time that we spend in prayer,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:11.380
we can't help it, you will start to become like the people you are next to. I see this,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:16.460
you know, even it's kind of humorous, but some of the couples who've been together for

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.700
a long time, all right, they can't tell, but someone from the outside looking, they start

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.200
sounding like each other. They even start looking like each other. They have the same

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:33.120
facial expressions, same mannerisms. You know, do others see Christ in us? Are we spending

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:41.120
time with Him daily? If so, you can't help it. Love is going to come out of you. He says,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.440
abide in me and I in you. As a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:55.640
vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. It's not a decision. You know what? Jeff,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.720
you're right. I need to be more loving. I've made the decision. I'm going to be more loving.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.200
It's going to last about as long as it takes for you to drive out onto the highway, all

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.200
right? We'll see how far that goes. Where does love come from? It doesn't come from

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.600
us. It comes from God. And if we're not spending time with Him every day, you're not going

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.720
to have the love of God within you. And you know, the more time that we spend with God,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:25.120
not only do we become more like Him, but we become warmed when we're next to the fire.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.400
I'm reminded of the disciples on the road to Emmaus. You know what they said? And they

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.880
turned after the Lord had showed Himself to them and He disappeared. And they said one

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:42.480
to another, did not our hearts burn within us when He talked with us by the way and while

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.240
He opened us the Scriptures? My friends, you don't have to stand alone, cold and miserable

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.320
in this Christian life. God wants you to be near. Draw an eye to God and He will draw

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:58.200
an eye to you. He wants you to be warm. He wants you to be on fire. Spending time with

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.480
God and also spending time with others, you know, love is contagious. Fire is hot, it's

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:10.240
bright and it spreads. In Hebrews 10.24, and let us consider one another to provoke unto

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.440
love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:24.120
of some is, but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.240
Are you encouraging one another? Are you praying for one another? I tell you what, you know,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.240
it's such an encouragement, such a blessing just to get around another brother or sister,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.480
whether it's even a phone call, whether it's to sit down and have a coffee and you just

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:48.840
share what God's doing in your life. It's like, wow, that was good, you know. My friends,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.640
if you need that, so does your brother, so does your sister. You know, in conclusion

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.800
tonight, God wants us to have life and to have it more abundantly. He wants our lives

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.760
to be overflowing with joy and peace and blessings. We will only experience those if our sacrifices

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:16.400
are in the right order and are set aflame. How is your fire tonight? Does it need stoking?

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:24.520
You know, a fire needs daily care. It's a daily walk. Apart from him will quickly grow

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.720
cold. In order, do you have it in the right order? Have you skipped over the burnt offering?

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.580
Are there areas in your life that you haven't surrendered? You know, God isn't asking for

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:43.020
all of our money or all of our time or all of our things. That's the meat offering. Those

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.420
are things that we give back apart to him and we get to enjoy the rest. But there's

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:57.340
one thing that he will not share. The burnt offering was not shared. Matthew 22, 37, and

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.820
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:08.300
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. God wants all of

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:17.940
our hearts to be consumed in flames of passion for Him. You know there's a song,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:25.140
is your all on the altar? The first verse says this, you have longed for sweet

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:32.660
peace, and for faith to increase, and have earnestly, fervently prayed, but you

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:42.300
cannot have rest or be perfectly blessed until all on the altar is laid. I pray

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:49.700
that's an encouragement or a blessing to you tonight, and I don't know how this

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.620
normally goes, a little different tonight, but why don't we close in a word of

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.140
prayer, and then I think Brother Dean, are you coming back up? Okay, all right,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:02.020
well let's just go ahead and go to Lord in prayer. Dear Lord, again I just want to

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.300
thank you for tonight. I want to thank you Lord for giving pastor and the

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.340
family safety as they were driving down lower to North Carolina. I pray that they

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:16.940
have a good time with the family down there, and bring them home safe, and Lord

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:23.300
I just want to thank you for speaking to my heart tonight, and Lord it is good

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:29.980
to be together. Lord, I just want to thank you for all that you do for us. I want to

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.980
thank you for the rest of this evening, and I pray that you'd be with the prayer

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.220
time to follow. In Jesus name I pray, amen.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.820
you

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.260
you

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.740
Thank you.
