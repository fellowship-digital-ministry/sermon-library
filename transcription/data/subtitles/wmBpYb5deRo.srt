1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Ezra chapter number seven, and as we get into the message this evening, of course, we're

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,500
not doing a series through the book of Ezra or even a character study on the life of Ezra.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,719
But Ezra chapter number seven, we'll look at these 10 verses.

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,000
I enjoy the opportunity to study lives of those that have gone before us.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,639
It's exciting to study Bible characters, to go through the word of God and to see men

6
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:31,959
and women that were used of the Lord to accomplish great things.

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:37,119
It's a joy and privilege to have the opportunity to read and study about those that have gone

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:45,419
before us that aren't necessarily Bible characters, but people that God used throughout the centuries.

9
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:50,360
Often I reference several of those individuals and how God used them and what a blessing

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,319
that is.

11
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,400
Oftentimes as we study the lives of those that have gone before us, whether they're

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,680
Bible character or not, we readily understand that they were people just like we're people.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,879
That they live life day by day, just like we live life day by day.

14
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:13,879
That they encountered difficulties and opposition and challenges, that they experienced victory,

15
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:20,519
they experienced just mighty things that God would do in and through their lives.

16
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,360
We find that often as we study the lives of those that have gone before us, that there

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,959
are times in which we see the victory that they experienced.

18
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,760
We see some great work that they were able to be involved in, something that God did

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,760
in and through their lives, and maybe we don't have the knowledge of maybe some preparation,

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,680
of maybe some of the early days.

21
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:51,800
I often think of David, and of course 1 Samuel chapter 17, many times if you ask somebody

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,559
about David, King David, you ask him about one of the greatest events, no doubt within

23
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:02,839
just a small group of people, someone will speak about David and Goliath.

24
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a very well known Bible account and what a great victory that was wrought on that day

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,800
as it's recorded in 1 Samuel 17, but we understand that there was some preparation that took

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,839
place in the life of David prior to him ever encountering Goliath in that valley.

27
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:26,160
It's exciting to study about the preparation.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:34,039
It's exciting, I preached a message once many years ago on training to slay giants, and

29
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:40,080
just the training that David, the experiences and all that God did in and through him, and

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
what a joy that is.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,559
When you think about Ezra, oftentimes some may think about Ezra and you think about him

32
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:54,520
standing upon that pulpit of wood and teaching the people of God the Word of God, and what

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,119
a wonderful account, Nehemiah chapter 8 records that for us, and I mean just an exciting passage

34
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:10,039
of Scripture, but well before he experienced that opportunity, we find that the Bible gives

35
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,479
us some insight into this man, Ezra.

36
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:19,679
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message simply this, Ezra, a ready scribe.

37
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,360
Ezra, a ready scribe.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,240
The Bible says in Ezra 7, in verse number 1, now after these things, in the reign of

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Sariah, the son of Azariah, the son of

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Hilkiah, the son of Shalom, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitab, the son of Amoriah, the

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,000
son of Azariah, the son of Merioth, the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzziah, the son of

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,160
Bukkiah, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,660
chief priest.

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,520
This Ezra, notice in verse number 6, went up from Babylon and he was a ready scribe

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,880
in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given, and the king granted him

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,759
all his requests according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.

47
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,720
Verse number 7, and there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,760
and the Levites and the singers and the porters and the Nethanims unto Jerusalem in the seventh

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,119
year of Artaxerxes the king.

50
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:25,600
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,839
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the

52
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,640
first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon

53
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
him.

54
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Now notice verse number 10.

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,959
The Bible says this, for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and

56
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:54,799
to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

57
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:59,320
Notice the Bible gives us some insight here to the man Ezra.

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,679
His genealogy is described in verses 1 through 5, and we find that it's traced back to Aaron

59
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:13,160
the chief priest, and we find that he is giving us here in this passage of Scripture his genealogy,

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,399
and certainly that's important for us to understand.

61
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,399
And we begin to get into verses 6 through 9, and we begin to understand kind of some

62
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,720
of the circumstances in which Ezra was serving the Lord, and we understand that the book

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,839
of Ezra is capturing for us the promised return of the remnant.

64
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,799
You'll remember that Jeremiah had been prophesying prior to the Babylonian captivity, and during

65
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:45,679
his time of prophecy we find that often throughout the prophecy you would find this truth of

66
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,820
the remnant returning after 70 years.

67
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:55,959
And we find that in the book of Ezra that God is providing us with that decree of Cyrus

68
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,559
that would allow for those people of God, the children of Israel that had been in Babylonian

69
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:04,399
captivity to return back to Jerusalem.

70
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,040
And so we find that there was a number of years that passed between the events in chapters

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,279
1 through 6, and here where we find in chapter number 7 when Ezra is now returning, it says

72
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,239
in verse 8 that he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, and you find that God's hand

73
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:25,459
was upon him, the good hand of his God upon him.

74
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:30,339
We see that in verse number 6, and again in verse number 9, and so we find that the

75
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,380
Bible gives us some understanding of his genealogy, of the circumstances, his arrival there into

76
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,940
Jerusalem, but I want you to focus upon verse number 10, and I'm simply going to break the

77
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,579
verse down and deal with it in individual statements, and trust that it would be a blessing

78
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,940
to you this evening.

79
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,220
It says, first of all, that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

80
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,980
That's a good thing, amen?

81
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,420
He had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

82
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,179
I believe that Ezra had an understanding of the preciousness of God's Word.

83
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,980
We often speak about how precious this book is.

84
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,660
We often hear you hear me say that this book is powerful and that it's precious, it's preserved,

85
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,779
it's perfect, and it's profitable, and we could speak about how wonderful the Word of

86
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,859
God is, and on a daily basis, I thank God for His Word.

87
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:36,019
I thank God for the opportunity as a believer to have the Word of God in my language, that

88
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:41,579
I can go to it and I can read it, that I can seek the law of the Lord.

89
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:48,100
We find that Ezra must have had an understanding of the preciousness of the Word of God, for

90
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:56,019
God tells us in giving us the description of this man's preparation, that he was a ready

91
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,019
scribe.

92
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:02,899
The Bible tells us that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

93
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,500
I wonder, perhaps Ezra had some level of knowledge.

94
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,260
Maybe he was familiar with Psalm 19.

95
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,640
Maybe he was familiar with Psalm 119.

96
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:20,760
We studied Psalm 119 in our adult Sunday school class last year, and we went stanza by stanza

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,720
through that entire Psalm, and how the Psalm reminds us of the preciousness and the importance

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,320
of the Word of God.

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,559
We find that David, of course, in Psalm 19, the law of the Lord is perfect, and we can

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,400
go through those verses and we can see the importance that God has placed, the priority

101
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
upon His Word.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,640
And I believe that Ezra had some knowledge, some level of knowledge with regard to the

103
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,039
truth of these principles in these verses.

104
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,760
Perhaps Ezra was aware of the principle that we find in Proverbs 30, in verse number 5,

105
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
where the Bible says,

106
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Every word of God is pure, He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.

107
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,799
Maybe Ezra had some level of knowledge with regard to Job, and we often think about Job

108
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,400
and of course the many trials in which he endured, and certainly he endured many trials.

109
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,760
But you understand that Job's testimony, the Bible tells us in verse number 12 of Job 23,

110
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
that he says,

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,159
I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,880
You see, Ezra, the Bible tells us that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of

113
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
the Lord.

114
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,239
Let me tell you, it's important for us to purpose in our heart and to prepare to seek

115
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,200
the law of the Lord.

116
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,159
I often have said during the Joshua lessons and going through this series of how grateful

117
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,640
I am that God's giving the instruction that He's giving.

118
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,880
to Joshua and we've spoken about the strategy at Jericho and then the

119
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,720
strategy at Ai and how God was faithful to give the direction and the

120
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,220
instruction and oh how we can rejoice in that but the reality is that we need to

121
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,920
then do it. Notice as we continue through this verse Ezra 7 and verse number 10

122
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,640
the Bible says he prepared for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of

123
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,240
the Lord notice these next words and to do it and to do it see the reality is

124
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,280
that we have James he didn't have James 1 we have James 1 that tells us that

125
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,200
were to be doers of the word and not hearers only and we understand that as

126
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Ezra the Bible is giving to us this perspective in this preparation of this

127
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,080
man that was referred to as being a ready scribe by the wall by the way in

128
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,080
the law of Moses it says here in verse number six and we find that he was a

129
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,320
ready scribe he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it

130
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,120
he didn't just desire to have a level of head knowledge he wanted to obey it he

131
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,120
understood that there was a level of profitability in the law of the Lord and

132
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,600
that it was given so that it would be followed see it's not about how many

133
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,840
Bible quizzes we can win it's not about how many you know we can play Bible

134
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,760
trivia games and then we can have all of the answers and we can list out all of

135
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,200
the whatever it's good to have that knowledge but we need to be doers of the

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,280
word and not hearers only see Ezra desired to know the law of the Lord he

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,600
had sought the law of the Lord but it says specifically and to do it remember

138
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Joshua 1 I spent really an entire lesson on this truth in verse number 8

139
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,480
and when the Bible says where the Lord is speaking to Joshua this book of the

140
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,920
law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein how

141
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,720
often day and night it says this that thou mayest observe to do according to

142
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,800
all that is written therein by the way we'll read the rest of the verse here in

143
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,040
just a moment but the book that God was speaking of when he spoke to Joshua this

144
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,120
wonderful principle was the law of Moses the Pentateuch as we often refer to it

145
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,120
as Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy that book as it would be

146
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,160
referred to he says this book of the law the law of Moses he says that not only

147
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,080
are to meditate there in day and night but that thou mayest observe to do

148
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,520
according to all that is written therein notice for then thou shalt make thy way

149
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:02,320
prosperous and then thou shalt have good success can I tell you that we want the

150
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,640
then we want the result right we want to have our way prosperous we want to have

151
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,800
good success but we find that we must be doers of the word and not hearers only

152
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,320
perhaps Ezra had some knowledge of Joshua 1 in verse number 8 perhaps he

153
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,120
had read as he had portions of scripture available to him perhaps he understood

154
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,960
this principle that God had given to Joshua perhaps Psalm 19 in verse number

155
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,840
11 I referenced already the 19th Psalm in our first point where the Bible

156
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,600
speaks about the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul and so on

157
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,160
and so forth and we sometimes sing this particular scripture song and Psalm 19

158
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
verses 7 through 11 but we find that it's in verse number 11 that as the

159
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,600
psalmist has given the truth with regard to the the the Word of God and the

160
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,640
statutes of the Lord and so on and so forth he says this moreover verse 11 of

161
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:09,560
Psalm 19 by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great

162
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,280
reward you know if you were to read Psalm 119 and you to read through all of

163
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,120
those verses and study the entirety of that passage of Scripture you will find

164
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,560
that there are many references within these verses of Scripture of keeping the

165
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,960
law obeying doing walking in and we find that all of those things point to

166
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,520
that simple phrase that it says of Ezra to do it see when we approach God's Word

167
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,760
on a daily basis when we are have prepared our heart to seek the law of

168
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,040
the Lord the the truth of the matter is that we ought to be in that place where

169
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,560
we say Lord help me to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only in fact it

170
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,120
would be advantageous for us as we go to the Scriptures on a daily basis and

171
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,160
whether you read one chapter or a hundred chapters as you go to the Word

172
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,280
of God on a daily basis that you would ask God to show you what is it that

173
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,320
you're teaching me what is it that I need to do what is there in this passage

174
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
of Scripture that I'm reading today as I'm seeking the truth that you've given

175
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,640
me Lord in your Word what is it that I need to do see the Bible says that Ezra

176
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,120
had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it notice the end

177
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,760
of Ezra 7 in verse number 10 the Bible says this and to teach in Israel

178
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:44,520
statutes and judgments I like that see the reality is that as we look at the

179
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,320
life of Ezra here and we look at what God is telling us about this ready

180
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,640
scribe about this one that had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord

181
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,600
and to do it but he also had this desire and to teach in Israel statutes and

182
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,480
judgments I believe that Ezra had an understanding that the truth that was

183
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,080
contained within the pages of Scripture was not only profitable for himself but

184
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,520
it was profitable for others this was something that that Ezra had a desire I

185
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,560
want to be able to teach these statutes in these judgments to others it's

186
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,520
interesting to know that before the opportunity was ever presented that

187
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,080
Ezra had already prepared I think that's important see it was not that Ezra was

188
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,520
given the job go teach and then all of a sudden he decided that he better go

189
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,400
prepare he'd already prepared his heart he'd already prepared to be able to get

190
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,640
into the law the Lord himself and to do it himself and then to teach in Israel

191
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,720
statutes and judgments as we think about that desire of Ezra as it's revealed to

192
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,080
us here in verse number 10 of this chapter we find that the Bible would

193
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,160
tell us in verse number 25 of Ezra 7 if you skip down there the Bible says and

194
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,280
thou Ezra after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand set magistrates

195
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,480
and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all

196
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,080
such as know the laws of thy God notice this last phrase and teach ye them that

197
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:26,280
know them not I'm glad that Ezra prepared I'm glad that he sought the

198
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Lord and sought the law of the Lord and that he was a doer of the word and not a

199
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,200
hearer only and that he desired to be able to teach in Israel these statutes

200
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,000
and judgments and we find that the opportunity had been granted to him and

201
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,080
he's told and to teach ye them that know them not teaching is exciting I know

202
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,280
that not everyone has the gift of teaching and I understand that we've all

203
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,520
been gifted by the Lord in a different manner but the reality is that we have

204
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,520
opportunities even as I spoke of this morning to share the truth of the Word

205
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,240
of God with those that we've come into contact with and that we'd be prepared

206
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,360
that we'd be ready we're gonna look at a truth in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and

207
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,760
before I get there you can turn over to Nehemiah chapter number 8 and we'll look

208
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,840
at that passage of Scripture here in just a moment but the reality is that

209
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,360
God teaches us in his Word that were to listen to this in first Peter 3 in verse

210
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,400
15 but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,679
answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with

212
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:43,040
meekness and fear be ready to give an answer Ezra he saw the Lord he saw the

213
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,960
law of the Lord he prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it

214
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,080
and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments turn to Nehemiah 8 you might

215
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,400
be there already as I mentioned a moment ago but notice in verse number 1 the

216
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,200
Bible says this and all the people gathered themselves together as one man

217
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,119
into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra the

218
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:12,400
scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to

219
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,960
Israel now remember the Bible told us back in Ezra chapter 7 in verse number

220
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,960
6 that he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses the Bible told us in verse

221
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,359
number 10 that Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to

222
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,320
do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments and so the Bible tells us

223
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,119
that the people gathered themselves together I hope in your mind's eye you

224
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,239
can see this gathering in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and the Bible tells us

225
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:44,480
that they spake unto Ezra and they said to Ezra who was the scribe they said

226
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,920
bring the book of the law of Moses and which the Lord had commanded to Israel

227
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,520
notice in verse 2 and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation

228
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,200
both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first

229
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
day of the

230
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,440
seventh month. And he read therein before the street that was before the water

231
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,200
gate from the morning until midday. He thought I preached long. Come on. It says

232
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,800
before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of

233
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,800
all the people were attentive under the book of the law. They had an approach to

234
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,320
hearing the law of the Lord, to hearing the Word of God. The Bible tells us that

235
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,240
they were attentive. The Bible says in verse number four, and Ezra the scribe

236
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,240
stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose. And beside him

237
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,720
stood Mattathiah and Shema and Ananiah and Uriah and Hilkiah, Massiah on his

238
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,680
right hand. On his left hand, Paddai and Mishael and Malkiah and Hashem and

239
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Hashabadana, Zechariah and Meshulam. I'm glad we don't have names like that

240
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,320
today. Amen. And Ezra, notice verse 5, opened the book in the sight of all the

241
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,440
people. For he was above all the people. When he opened it, all the people stood

242
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:13,680
up. You think about the significance of what's happening and you think about the

243
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,920
preparation of Ezra that we looked at in Ezra 7. And we find that the people

244
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,440
stand up in reverence for the Word of God for that which they're going to

245
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,400
hear. The Bible says that Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the

246
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:32,760
people answered, amen, amen. With lifting up their hands, they bowed their heads

247
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,560
and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground. The Bible says also

248
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:47,200
Joshua and Bani and Sherabiah, Jamin, Aqab, Shabbathiah, Horaijah, Messiah,

249
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,560
Kelita, Azariah, Josabath, Hanan, Peliah, and the Levites, notice this, caused the

250
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,600
people to understand the law and the people stood in their place. In verse

251
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,080
number 8, the Bible says, so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly

252
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,920
and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading. I believe that

253
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,240
verse number 8 of Nehemiah, chapter number 8, is a great model for preaching.

254
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,760
Preaching is only preaching if we're using the book, the Word of God. You

255
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,040
don't need my opinions or anyone else's opinions, we need the Word of God. The

256
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,520
Bible says that they read in the book in the law of God distinctly. The Bible is

257
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,880
the the resource that we go to and we know that it's what we need and God's

258
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,920
given it to us, but then notice this, and gave the sense, an explanation, an

259
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:52,560
exposition, then it says this, and caused them to understand the reading. And what

260
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,440
a joy these people as they gathered together and we see all that is

261
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,040
happening and we understand this great opportunity and perhaps there are times

262
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,160
in which we see Ezra the scribe that he's at this place and he's doing the

263
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,600
work that we find here in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and we think about how

264
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,800
wonderful this is and indeed it's wonderful. There was some preparation.

265
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,720
There were some insights that God gave us to the character of this man Ezra

266
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,280
back in Ezra chapter number 7. Notice in verse number 12, and all the people went

267
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth

268
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,480
because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. Isn't it a

269
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,960
wonderful thing when you understand the Word of God? There are times in which you

270
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,920
might wrestle over a portion of Scripture in your own personal walk with

271
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,520
the Lord. You're studying the Word of God and you're reading it and you're, Lord I

272
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,560
don't understand this and Lord teach me and we can rejoice in the fact that we

273
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,560
have the Holy Spirit who's our teacher. And we see that these people left and

274
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,660
they understood the words that were declared unto them and on the second day

275
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,180
verse 13, were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people,

276
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:12,140
the priests and the Levites. Notice this, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand

277
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,700
the words of the law. Notice who was gathered to him according to verse

278
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,620
number 13 on the second day. It says that they were gathered to him, the chief of

279
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:28,020
the fathers of all the people, the priests and the Levites. And so now Ezra

280
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,700
has this opportunity to give truth, to give instruction to this group of people

281
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,140
that would gather here on this particular day. I love reading about the

282
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,740
ministry and the opportunity that Ezra had and I just wonder today in our lives

283
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,540
as we think about this Old Testament Bible character Ezra and we say man

284
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,220
that's wonderful that Ezra, a ready scribe, Ezra a man that had prepared his

285
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,540
heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes

286
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,500
and judgments. Can I tell you that the opportunity came and Ezra was ready. Can

287
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,900
you imagine the the way that the text of Scripture would read in Nehemiah 8 in

288
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,020
verse number 1 when they spake unto Ezra and said bring the book of the law of

289
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,300
Moses and come teach us and he's like ah give me some time. It just doesn't work

290
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,300
right he had already prepared he was ready. Notice what the Bible tells us in

291
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,740
Romans chapter number 1. I want to look at the example here briefly in

292
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,100
conclusion this evening of the testimony of the Apostle Paul. There are three

293
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,740
statements that he makes in Romans chapter number 1 verse 14, 15 and 16.

294
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,420
I won't cover all of that and deal with it's really a message in of itself but I

295
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,700
just want to look at what he says in verse number 15 and I want to think

296
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,540
about the way in which the Bible tells us of Ezra that he was a ready scribe

297
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,020
and how he did prepared his heart but we find here in Romans 1 in verse number

298
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,100
15 the Bible says this that Paul is speaking to these believers that he's

299
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,020
writing to and he says this so as much as in me is I am ready to preach the

300
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:17,620
gospel to you that are at Rome also. And I think about that Paul making that

301
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,900
declaration he was ready to go and to preach in Rome the gospel and I am

302
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,180
mindful of the way in which the Apostle Paul entered into his first missionary

303
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,460
journey when he went into the region of Galatia and the Bible tells us that they

304
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,220
came to Antioch and Pisidia it's recorded in Acts 13 and as they would go

305
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,780
to the synagogue in that city the Bible says that those that were gathered said

306
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,940
to Paul they said do you have any word of exhortation you know what Paul did

307
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,300
he stood up and he preached you can read the message in Acts 13 we don't have

308
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,060
anywhere near the amount of time to go through all of the message but we find

309
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,900
that what Paul did is he began all the way back in the Old Testament he began

310
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,100
preaching and teaching how that these Old Testament prophecies were pointing

311
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,660
to Messiah that this Jesus is the Christ he is the Messiah and we find

312
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,460
that the opportunity presented himself to him and he was ready he stood up and

313
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,700
he preached what a great message he preached a powerful message we find that

314
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,020
there were some of course that returned and that responded excuse me and

315
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,140
received the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and for that we can

316
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:41,820
certainly rejoice this evening we think of Ezra I wonder from this Old Testament

317
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:49,260
character many many many years ago we see that after the remnant returned to

318
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,820
Jerusalem that Ezra had the opportunity to go as well and the Bible tells us

319
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,220
that Ezra was a ready scribe and he had prepared his heart to seek the law the

320
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,820
Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments I wonder

321
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,500
are we seeking or have we prepared our heart to seek the law of the Lord really

322
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,300
getting into the Bible allowing the Bible to get into us we're understanding

323
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,820
the importance of this book and not just to have some level of knowledge to speak

324
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:29,900
about it but to do it he was seeking the law the Lord and to do it and then to

325
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,820
teach in Israel statutes and judgments you know there's somebody that you that

326
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,020
God might have in your life that you would have the opportunity to teach some

327
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,739
of the things of the Word of God might not be in a public setting it might not

328
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:49,900
be in a as a profession quote-unquote but there might be some opportunities

329
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,980
that we have to to give an answer to a man of the hope that lieth within us to

330
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,299
teach them to give them the gospel what a great opportunity that is and how we

331
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:07,299
need to be ready ready servants ready to do the work of the Lord when when the

332
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,619
opportunity would come that we would not miss the opportunity because of we

333
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:15,820
because of the fact that we failed to prepare but that we would prepare even

334
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,980
now so that when the opportunity would present itself we'd be ready father we

335
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,900
love you and we thank you for loving us we thank you for thy word we thank you

336
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,580
for the truth of thy word and we thank you for the life and ministry of Ezra we

337
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,100
thank you for the opportunity to read of that which you allowed him to do in the

338
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,100
book of Nehemiah and the teaching of the law of the Lord and what a great

339
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,700
testimony we thank you that this was a man that was not only a student of the

340
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,660
word but a doer of the word Lord we thank you for the example and we pray

341
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:57,020
that you would help us as your servants today to seek the law of the Lord to

342
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,059
seek to understand thy word to daily dig into the word of God

343
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:07,059
and to allow Your Word to impact us and affect us and change us.

344
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:11,859
I pray, God, that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

345
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:16,459
We do pray that You would give us opportunities to teach,

346
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,859
not necessarily in a public setting,

347
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,659
but Lord, to be able to give some truth to those

348
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,459
that we come into contact with from Your Word.

349
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,259
What a great blessing and privilege that is.

350
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,459
We pray, God, that You'd work in our hearts and lives,

351
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,459
even as we look at the example of Ezra,

352
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:37,659
and seek to follow that wonderful pattern that was set forth,

353
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:40,859
that we too would be ready.

354
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,459
For it's in Christ's name we pray, Amen.
