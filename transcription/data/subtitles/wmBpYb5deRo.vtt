00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
Ezra chapter number seven, and as we get into the message this evening, of course, we're

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.500
not doing a series through the book of Ezra or even a character study on the life of Ezra.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.719
But Ezra chapter number seven, we'll look at these 10 verses.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:23.000
I enjoy the opportunity to study lives of those that have gone before us.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.639
It's exciting to study Bible characters, to go through the word of God and to see men

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:31.959
and women that were used of the Lord to accomplish great things.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:37.119
It's a joy and privilege to have the opportunity to read and study about those that have gone

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:45.419
before us that aren't necessarily Bible characters, but people that God used throughout the centuries.

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:50.360
Often I reference several of those individuals and how God used them and what a blessing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.319
that is.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.400
Oftentimes as we study the lives of those that have gone before us, whether they're

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.680
Bible character or not, we readily understand that they were people just like we're people.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.879
That they live life day by day, just like we live life day by day.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:13.879
That they encountered difficulties and opposition and challenges, that they experienced victory,

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:20.519
they experienced just mighty things that God would do in and through their lives.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:26.360
We find that often as we study the lives of those that have gone before us, that there

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.959
are times in which we see the victory that they experienced.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.760
We see some great work that they were able to be involved in, something that God did

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.760
in and through their lives, and maybe we don't have the knowledge of maybe some preparation,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680
of maybe some of the early days.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:51.800
I often think of David, and of course 1 Samuel chapter 17, many times if you ask somebody

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.559
about David, King David, you ask him about one of the greatest events, no doubt within

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:02.839
just a small group of people, someone will speak about David and Goliath.

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:09.000
It's a very well known Bible account and what a great victory that was wrought on that day

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.800
as it's recorded in 1 Samuel 17, but we understand that there was some preparation that took

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.839
place in the life of David prior to him ever encountering Goliath in that valley.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.160
It's exciting to study about the preparation.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.039
It's exciting, I preached a message once many years ago on training to slay giants, and

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:40.080
just the training that David, the experiences and all that God did in and through him, and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
what a joy that is.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.559
When you think about Ezra, oftentimes some may think about Ezra and you think about him

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:54.520
standing upon that pulpit of wood and teaching the people of God the Word of God, and what

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.119
a wonderful account, Nehemiah chapter 8 records that for us, and I mean just an exciting passage

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:10.039
of Scripture, but well before he experienced that opportunity, we find that the Bible gives

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.479
us some insight into this man, Ezra.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:19.679
If you're taking notes, I've titled the message simply this, Ezra, a ready scribe.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.360
Ezra, a ready scribe.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.240
The Bible says in Ezra 7, in verse number 1, now after these things, in the reign of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.960
Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Sariah, the son of Azariah, the son of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.800
Hilkiah, the son of Shalom, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitab, the son of Amoriah, the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.000
son of Azariah, the son of Merioth, the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzziah, the son of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.160
Bukkiah, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.660
chief priest.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.520
This Ezra, notice in verse number 6, went up from Babylon and he was a ready scribe

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.880
in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given, and the king granted him

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.759
all his requests according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.720
Verse number 7, and there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.760
and the Levites and the singers and the porters and the Nethanims unto Jerusalem in the seventh

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.119
year of Artaxerxes the king.

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:25.600
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.839
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:37.640
first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640
him.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.640
Now notice verse number 10.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.959
The Bible says this, for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:54.799
to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:59.320
Notice the Bible gives us some insight here to the man Ezra.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.679
His genealogy is described in verses 1 through 5, and we find that it's traced back to Aaron

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:13.160
the chief priest, and we find that he is giving us here in this passage of Scripture his genealogy,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.399
and certainly that's important for us to understand.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:21.399
And we begin to get into verses 6 through 9, and we begin to understand kind of some

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.720
of the circumstances in which Ezra was serving the Lord, and we understand that the book

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.839
of Ezra is capturing for us the promised return of the remnant.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:38.799
You'll remember that Jeremiah had been prophesying prior to the Babylonian captivity, and during

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:45.679
his time of prophecy we find that often throughout the prophecy you would find this truth of

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.820
the remnant returning after 70 years.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.959
And we find that in the book of Ezra that God is providing us with that decree of Cyrus

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:00.559
that would allow for those people of God, the children of Israel that had been in Babylonian

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.399
captivity to return back to Jerusalem.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:09.040
And so we find that there was a number of years that passed between the events in chapters

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.279
1 through 6, and here where we find in chapter number 7 when Ezra is now returning, it says

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:21.239
in verse 8 that he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, and you find that God's hand

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:25.459
was upon him, the good hand of his God upon him.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:30.339
We see that in verse number 6, and again in verse number 9, and so we find that the

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:37.380
Bible gives us some understanding of his genealogy, of the circumstances, his arrival there into

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.940
Jerusalem, but I want you to focus upon verse number 10, and I'm simply going to break the

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.579
verse down and deal with it in individual statements, and trust that it would be a blessing

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:50.940
to you this evening.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.220
It says, first of all, that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.980
That's a good thing, amen?

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.420
He had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.179
I believe that Ezra had an understanding of the preciousness of God's Word.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.980
We often speak about how precious this book is.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.660
We often hear you hear me say that this book is powerful and that it's precious, it's preserved,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.779
it's perfect, and it's profitable, and we could speak about how wonderful the Word of

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.859
God is, and on a daily basis, I thank God for His Word.

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:36.019
I thank God for the opportunity as a believer to have the Word of God in my language, that

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:41.579
I can go to it and I can read it, that I can seek the law of the Lord.

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:48.100
We find that Ezra must have had an understanding of the preciousness of the Word of God, for

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:56.019
God tells us in giving us the description of this man's preparation, that he was a ready

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:57.019
scribe.

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:02.899
The Bible tells us that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.500
I wonder, perhaps Ezra had some level of knowledge.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.260
Maybe he was familiar with Psalm 19.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.640
Maybe he was familiar with Psalm 119.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.760
We studied Psalm 119 in our adult Sunday school class last year, and we went stanza by stanza

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.720
through that entire Psalm, and how the Psalm reminds us of the preciousness and the importance

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.320
of the Word of God.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.559
We find that David, of course, in Psalm 19, the law of the Lord is perfect, and we can

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:41.400
go through those verses and we can see the importance that God has placed, the priority

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400
upon His Word.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:49.640
And I believe that Ezra had some knowledge, some level of knowledge with regard to the

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.039
truth of these principles in these verses.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:59.760
Perhaps Ezra was aware of the principle that we find in Proverbs 30, in verse number 5,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760
where the Bible says,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:07.320
Every word of God is pure, He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.799
Maybe Ezra had some level of knowledge with regard to Job, and we often think about Job

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:20.400
and of course the many trials in which he endured, and certainly he endured many trials.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.760
But you understand that Job's testimony, the Bible tells us in verse number 12 of Job 23,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760
that he says,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.159
I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.880
You see, Ezra, the Bible tells us that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
the Lord.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.239
Let me tell you, it's important for us to purpose in our heart and to prepare to seek

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:49.200
the law of the Lord.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.159
I often have said during the Joshua lessons and going through this series of how grateful

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:59.640
I am that God's giving the instruction that He's giving.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.880
to Joshua and we've spoken about the strategy at Jericho and then the

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.720
strategy at Ai and how God was faithful to give the direction and the

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.220
instruction and oh how we can rejoice in that but the reality is that we need to

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:20.920
then do it. Notice as we continue through this verse Ezra 7 and verse number 10

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.640
the Bible says he prepared for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:34.240
the Lord notice these next words and to do it and to do it see the reality is

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.280
that we have James he didn't have James 1 we have James 1 that tells us that

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.200
were to be doers of the word and not hearers only and we understand that as

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.880
Ezra the Bible is giving to us this perspective in this preparation of this

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.080
man that was referred to as being a ready scribe by the wall by the way in

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.080
the law of Moses it says here in verse number six and we find that he was a

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.320
ready scribe he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:10.120
he didn't just desire to have a level of head knowledge he wanted to obey it he

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.120
understood that there was a level of profitability in the law of the Lord and

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.600
that it was given so that it would be followed see it's not about how many

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.840
Bible quizzes we can win it's not about how many you know we can play Bible

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.760
trivia games and then we can have all of the answers and we can list out all of

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.200
the whatever it's good to have that knowledge but we need to be doers of the

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.280
word and not hearers only see Ezra desired to know the law of the Lord he

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.600
had sought the law of the Lord but it says specifically and to do it remember

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.360
Joshua 1 I spent really an entire lesson on this truth in verse number 8

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.480
and when the Bible says where the Lord is speaking to Joshua this book of the

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.920
law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein how

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.720
often day and night it says this that thou mayest observe to do according to

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:19.800
all that is written therein by the way we'll read the rest of the verse here in

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.040
just a moment but the book that God was speaking of when he spoke to Joshua this

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.120
wonderful principle was the law of Moses the Pentateuch as we often refer to it

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:36.120
as Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy that book as it would be

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.160
referred to he says this book of the law the law of Moses he says that not only

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.080
are to meditate there in day and night but that thou mayest observe to do

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:54.520
according to all that is written therein notice for then thou shalt make thy way

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:02.320
prosperous and then thou shalt have good success can I tell you that we want the

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.640
then we want the result right we want to have our way prosperous we want to have

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.800
good success but we find that we must be doers of the word and not hearers only

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.320
perhaps Ezra had some knowledge of Joshua 1 in verse number 8 perhaps he

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.120
had read as he had portions of scripture available to him perhaps he understood

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.960
this principle that God had given to Joshua perhaps Psalm 19 in verse number

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.840
11 I referenced already the 19th Psalm in our first point where the Bible

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.600
speaks about the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul and so on

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.160
and so forth and we sometimes sing this particular scripture song and Psalm 19

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.880
verses 7 through 11 but we find that it's in verse number 11 that as the

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.600
psalmist has given the truth with regard to the the the Word of God and the

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.640
statutes of the Lord and so on and so forth he says this moreover verse 11 of

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:09.560
Psalm 19 by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.280
reward you know if you were to read Psalm 119 and you to read through all of

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.120
those verses and study the entirety of that passage of Scripture you will find

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.560
that there are many references within these verses of Scripture of keeping the

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.960
law obeying doing walking in and we find that all of those things point to

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.520
that simple phrase that it says of Ezra to do it see when we approach God's Word

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.760
on a daily basis when we are have prepared our heart to seek the law of

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.040
the Lord the the truth of the matter is that we ought to be in that place where

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.560
we say Lord help me to be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only in fact it

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.120
would be advantageous for us as we go to the Scriptures on a daily basis and

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.160
whether you read one chapter or a hundred chapters as you go to the Word

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.280
of God on a daily basis that you would ask God to show you what is it that

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.320
you're teaching me what is it that I need to do what is there in this passage

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.720
of Scripture that I'm reading today as I'm seeking the truth that you've given

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.640
me Lord in your Word what is it that I need to do see the Bible says that Ezra

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.120
had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it notice the end

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:36.760
of Ezra 7 in verse number 10 the Bible says this and to teach in Israel

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:44.520
statutes and judgments I like that see the reality is that as we look at the

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.320
life of Ezra here and we look at what God is telling us about this ready

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.640
scribe about this one that had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.600
and to do it but he also had this desire and to teach in Israel statutes and

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.480
judgments I believe that Ezra had an understanding that the truth that was

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.080
contained within the pages of Scripture was not only profitable for himself but

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.520
it was profitable for others this was something that that Ezra had a desire I

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.560
want to be able to teach these statutes in these judgments to others it's

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.520
interesting to know that before the opportunity was ever presented that

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.080
Ezra had already prepared I think that's important see it was not that Ezra was

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.520
given the job go teach and then all of a sudden he decided that he better go

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.400
prepare he'd already prepared his heart he'd already prepared to be able to get

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.640
into the law the Lord himself and to do it himself and then to teach in Israel

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.720
statutes and judgments as we think about that desire of Ezra as it's revealed to

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.080
us here in verse number 10 of this chapter we find that the Bible would

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.160
tell us in verse number 25 of Ezra 7 if you skip down there the Bible says and

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.280
thou Ezra after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand set magistrates

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.480
and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.080
such as know the laws of thy God notice this last phrase and teach ye them that

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:26.280
know them not I'm glad that Ezra prepared I'm glad that he sought the

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.640
Lord and sought the law of the Lord and that he was a doer of the word and not a

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.200
hearer only and that he desired to be able to teach in Israel these statutes

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.000
and judgments and we find that the opportunity had been granted to him and

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.080
he's told and to teach ye them that know them not teaching is exciting I know

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.280
that not everyone has the gift of teaching and I understand that we've all

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.520
been gifted by the Lord in a different manner but the reality is that we have

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.520
opportunities even as I spoke of this morning to share the truth of the Word

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.240
of God with those that we've come into contact with and that we'd be prepared

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.360
that we'd be ready we're gonna look at a truth in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.760
before I get there you can turn over to Nehemiah chapter number 8 and we'll look

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.840
at that passage of Scripture here in just a moment but the reality is that

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.360
God teaches us in his Word that were to listen to this in first Peter 3 in verse

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.400
15 but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.679
answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:43.040
meekness and fear be ready to give an answer Ezra he saw the Lord he saw the

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.960
law of the Lord he prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.080
and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments turn to Nehemiah 8 you might

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.400
be there already as I mentioned a moment ago but notice in verse number 1 the

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.200
Bible says this and all the people gathered themselves together as one man

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.119
into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra the

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:12.400
scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.960
Israel now remember the Bible told us back in Ezra chapter 7 in verse number

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.960
6 that he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses the Bible told us in verse

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.359
number 10 that Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:31.320
do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments and so the Bible tells us

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.119
that the people gathered themselves together I hope in your mind's eye you

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:39.239
can see this gathering in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and the Bible tells us

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:44.480
that they spake unto Ezra and they said to Ezra who was the scribe they said

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.920
bring the book of the law of Moses and which the Lord had commanded to Israel

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.520
notice in verse 2 and Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.200
both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.080
day of the

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.440
seventh month. And he read therein before the street that was before the water

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:13.200
gate from the morning until midday. He thought I preached long. Come on. It says

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.800
before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:24.800
all the people were attentive under the book of the law. They had an approach to

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.320
hearing the law of the Lord, to hearing the Word of God. The Bible tells us that

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.240
they were attentive. The Bible says in verse number four, and Ezra the scribe

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.240
stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose. And beside him

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.720
stood Mattathiah and Shema and Ananiah and Uriah and Hilkiah, Massiah on his

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.680
right hand. On his left hand, Paddai and Mishael and Malkiah and Hashem and

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.160
Hashabadana, Zechariah and Meshulam. I'm glad we don't have names like that

00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.320
today. Amen. And Ezra, notice verse 5, opened the book in the sight of all the

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.440
people. For he was above all the people. When he opened it, all the people stood

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:13.680
up. You think about the significance of what's happening and you think about the

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.920
preparation of Ezra that we looked at in Ezra 7. And we find that the people

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.440
stand up in reverence for the Word of God for that which they're going to

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.400
hear. The Bible says that Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:32.760
people answered, amen, amen. With lifting up their hands, they bowed their heads

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.560
and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground. The Bible says also

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:47.200
Joshua and Bani and Sherabiah, Jamin, Aqab, Shabbathiah, Horaijah, Messiah,

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.560
Kelita, Azariah, Josabath, Hanan, Peliah, and the Levites, notice this, caused the

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.600
people to understand the law and the people stood in their place. In verse

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.080
number 8, the Bible says, so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:13.920
and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading. I believe that

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:19.240
verse number 8 of Nehemiah, chapter number 8, is a great model for preaching.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.760
Preaching is only preaching if we're using the book, the Word of God. You

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.040
don't need my opinions or anyone else's opinions, we need the Word of God. The

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.520
Bible says that they read in the book in the law of God distinctly. The Bible is

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.880
the the resource that we go to and we know that it's what we need and God's

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.920
given it to us, but then notice this, and gave the sense, an explanation, an

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:52.560
exposition, then it says this, and caused them to understand the reading. And what

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.440
a joy these people as they gathered together and we see all that is

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.040
happening and we understand this great opportunity and perhaps there are times

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.160
in which we see Ezra the scribe that he's at this place and he's doing the

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.600
work that we find here in Nehemiah chapter number 8 and we think about how

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.800
wonderful this is and indeed it's wonderful. There was some preparation.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.720
There were some insights that God gave us to the character of this man Ezra

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.280
back in Ezra chapter number 7. Notice in verse number 12, and all the people went

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.320
their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.480
because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. Isn't it a

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.960
wonderful thing when you understand the Word of God? There are times in which you

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.920
might wrestle over a portion of Scripture in your own personal walk with

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.520
the Lord. You're studying the Word of God and you're reading it and you're, Lord I

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.560
don't understand this and Lord teach me and we can rejoice in the fact that we

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.560
have the Holy Spirit who's our teacher. And we see that these people left and

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.660
they understood the words that were declared unto them and on the second day

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.180
verse 13, were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:12.140
the priests and the Levites. Notice this, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.700
the words of the law. Notice who was gathered to him according to verse

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.620
number 13 on the second day. It says that they were gathered to him, the chief of

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:28.020
the fathers of all the people, the priests and the Levites. And so now Ezra

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.700
has this opportunity to give truth, to give instruction to this group of people

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:40.140
that would gather here on this particular day. I love reading about the

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:46.740
ministry and the opportunity that Ezra had and I just wonder today in our lives

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.540
as we think about this Old Testament Bible character Ezra and we say man

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.220
that's wonderful that Ezra, a ready scribe, Ezra a man that had prepared his

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.540
heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:06.500
and judgments. Can I tell you that the opportunity came and Ezra was ready. Can

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.900
you imagine the the way that the text of Scripture would read in Nehemiah 8 in

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.020
verse number 1 when they spake unto Ezra and said bring the book of the law of

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:22.300
Moses and come teach us and he's like ah give me some time. It just doesn't work

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.300
right he had already prepared he was ready. Notice what the Bible tells us in

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.740
Romans chapter number 1. I want to look at the example here briefly in

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:38.100
conclusion this evening of the testimony of the Apostle Paul. There are three

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.740
statements that he makes in Romans chapter number 1 verse 14, 15 and 16.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.420
I won't cover all of that and deal with it's really a message in of itself but I

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.700
just want to look at what he says in verse number 15 and I want to think

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.540
about the way in which the Bible tells us of Ezra that he was a ready scribe

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.020
and how he did prepared his heart but we find here in Romans 1 in verse number

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:04.100
15 the Bible says this that Paul is speaking to these believers that he's

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.020
writing to and he says this so as much as in me is I am ready to preach the

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:17.620
gospel to you that are at Rome also. And I think about that Paul making that

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.900
declaration he was ready to go and to preach in Rome the gospel and I am

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:28.180
mindful of the way in which the Apostle Paul entered into his first missionary

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.460
journey when he went into the region of Galatia and the Bible tells us that they

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.220
came to Antioch and Pisidia it's recorded in Acts 13 and as they would go

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.780
to the synagogue in that city the Bible says that those that were gathered said

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:48.940
to Paul they said do you have any word of exhortation you know what Paul did

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:54.300
he stood up and he preached you can read the message in Acts 13 we don't have

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.060
anywhere near the amount of time to go through all of the message but we find

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.900
that what Paul did is he began all the way back in the Old Testament he began

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.100
preaching and teaching how that these Old Testament prophecies were pointing

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.660
to Messiah that this Jesus is the Christ he is the Messiah and we find

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:19.460
that the opportunity presented himself to him and he was ready he stood up and

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:25.700
he preached what a great message he preached a powerful message we find that

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:31.020
there were some of course that returned and that responded excuse me and

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.140
received the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and for that we can

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:41.820
certainly rejoice this evening we think of Ezra I wonder from this Old Testament

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:49.260
character many many many years ago we see that after the remnant returned to

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.820
Jerusalem that Ezra had the opportunity to go as well and the Bible tells us

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.220
that Ezra was a ready scribe and he had prepared his heart to seek the law the

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:04.820
Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments I wonder

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.500
are we seeking or have we prepared our heart to seek the law of the Lord really

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.300
getting into the Bible allowing the Bible to get into us we're understanding

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.820
the importance of this book and not just to have some level of knowledge to speak

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:29.900
about it but to do it he was seeking the law the Lord and to do it and then to

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.820
teach in Israel statutes and judgments you know there's somebody that you that

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:39.020
God might have in your life that you would have the opportunity to teach some

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.739
of the things of the Word of God might not be in a public setting it might not

00:28:43.739 --> 00:28:49.900
be in a as a profession quote-unquote but there might be some opportunities

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.980
that we have to to give an answer to a man of the hope that lieth within us to

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:01.299
teach them to give them the gospel what a great opportunity that is and how we

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:07.299
need to be ready ready servants ready to do the work of the Lord when when the

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:11.619
opportunity would come that we would not miss the opportunity because of we

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:15.820
because of the fact that we failed to prepare but that we would prepare even

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.980
now so that when the opportunity would present itself we'd be ready father we

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.900
love you and we thank you for loving us we thank you for thy word we thank you

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.580
for the truth of thy word and we thank you for the life and ministry of Ezra we

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:36.100
thank you for the opportunity to read of that which you allowed him to do in the

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.100
book of Nehemiah and the teaching of the law of the Lord and what a great

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.700
testimony we thank you that this was a man that was not only a student of the

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.660
word but a doer of the word Lord we thank you for the example and we pray

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.020
that you would help us as your servants today to seek the law of the Lord to

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.059
seek to understand thy word to daily dig into the word of God

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:07.059
and to allow Your Word to impact us and affect us and change us.

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:11.859
I pray, God, that we'd be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:30:11.859 --> 00:30:16.459
We do pray that You would give us opportunities to teach,

00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:18.859
not necessarily in a public setting,

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:23.659
but Lord, to be able to give some truth to those

00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:26.459
that we come into contact with from Your Word.

00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:29.259
What a great blessing and privilege that is.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:31.459
We pray, God, that You'd work in our hearts and lives,

00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:33.459
even as we look at the example of Ezra,

00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:37.659
and seek to follow that wonderful pattern that was set forth,

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:40.859
that we too would be ready.

00:30:40.859 --> 00:30:43.459
For it's in Christ's name we pray, Amen.
