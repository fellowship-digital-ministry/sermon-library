1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And our theme for this year is Great is the Lord,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and we've been dealing with various aspects from God's Word,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
how God has revealed to us His greatness.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And it's a wonderful thing, as the psalmist has declared in other portions of Scripture,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or read the Bible says, of those that knew they understood,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
they were aware of the fact that God is great.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I believe, as I've mentioned many times throughout this calendar year,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that each of us that are gathered here this morning,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that if we were to be asked individually,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
do you know, do you believe that God is great?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I believe that we would answer, yes, we know that God is great.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And then we begin to try to answer the question as to,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
well, why is God great?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Describe for me His greatness.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And we've looked at a number of things,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we've spoken about God's great power, God's great wisdom.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And a few weeks ago, we dealt with the subject of His great love.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the book of Ephesians, in the second chapter,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we read of that very statement that God, who is rich in mercy with His great love,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
wherewith He loved us.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I'm so thankful for the love of God.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
During that particular message, and it was several weeks ago now,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we've had Mother's Day and Missions Conference and other things going on.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was several weeks ago that we dealt with that subject matter.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But we ended the message by saying that not only is God's love declared and demonstrated,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but we said that God's love is described or defined.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I went through a number of verses of Scripture,

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and I gave you seven descriptive terms of God's love.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I'll just very quickly reveal those or review those to you this morning.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I said this, that God's love is described in these seven ways.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Number one, it's great love.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Number two, it's everlasting love.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Number three, it's sacrificial love.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I'm thankful for the sacrifice that the Lord Jesus Christ made on the cross of Calvary.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I said this, number four, that it's unconditional.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I'm thankful that God loves us, that God loves me in spite of myself,

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
my failures, all of the things.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
God loves us. It's unconditional.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I said this, God's love is universal.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For God so loved the world.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm thankful that the truth of God's word is that God is not willing that any should perish,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but that all should come to repentance, and that God loves everyone.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is a universal love.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are people that we can come in contact with every day of our lives,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and we can rest assured in knowing this truth that God loves them.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You say, but they're a sinner. They're not lovable.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They're this, so were you, so am I.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And God loves, and we're so thankful that His love is universal.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But then I said this, God's love is personal.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
God's love is personal.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's amazing to understand that God loves the world,

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and we look at that, and we think about the large number of population,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and that God loves every single person who loves the world.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But then we bring it to our own selves and say, but God loves me as an individual.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He loves me personally.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then I said that God's love can be described as being protective.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So many today would like to describe or pretend to describe that God's love is permissive.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, God loves me, and therefore He's okay with this, that, and the other thing.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And the reality is that God's love is protective,

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and we ought to be mindful of that and understand that truth this morning.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And so we talked about His great love,

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and we looked at those truths from God's word with how God's love is described or defined for us.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And we spoke about that wonderful song that's in our songbook,

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I Am So Glad That Jesus Loves Me, Jesus Loves Even Me.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The reality is that the songwriter said, wonderful things in the Bible I see.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There are some amazing things that you read in God's word.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm so thankful that God's given us this precious book, the Bible.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But this is the dearest, is what the songwriter said,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
this is the dearest that Jesus loves me.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think about the subject of God's love.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a fascinating study.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're blessed to know this powerful truth.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There are countless millions of people, perhaps even this morning we would say

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
countless billions of people upon the face of the earth today

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that have never heard, do not understand the very basic truth

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that we're dealing with this morning that God loves them.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know, you can talk to people today that you come into contact with.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We live in a place, in an area in Northern Virginia

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
where it seems as if almost every country of the world is represented in our backyard.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's such a diverse area, and I love it.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think it's absolutely wonderful.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We've been able to learn so many wonderful things

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and be able to interact with people from different places.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But the reality is that I talk to people sometimes,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and because of where they are from, because of where they grew up,

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
because of being steeped in some cult or religion,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
they've never heard the basic truth that God loves them.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They don't understand what it means.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And this morning we can rest assured and we can have great joy in our hearts

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
with knowing this great truth that He loves me.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Understand this morning that He loves you not because you deserve His love.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
None of us are deserving of His love.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But He chooses to love us.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He chose to love us.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is love.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
For that we ought to rejoice.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
John was a man of God that was used by God.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's one of the apostles, and John was privileged to have the opportunity

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to be the human penman.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We know that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but we also know that God used men,

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
holy men of God, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and God used the apostle John to pen the book of John

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and also the three letters, the epistles, if you will,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that also bear his name, 1st, 2nd, 3rd John,

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and then also the book of Revelation.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And what a blessing to think about John having the privilege

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
as the human penman of these wonderful books of God's Word.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
As we begin to think about the book of John, the Gospel of John,

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the book of 1st John, many times within those portions of Scriptures,

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you read them, you read how John deals with the subject of God's love.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You read of John dealing with that subject,

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and we find that as we come to the 13th chapter,

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
there's a phrase here that I've used for our title this morning,

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and I hope that it would encourage you as we look at some things this morning

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
with regard to the love of God,

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and we've used this phrase from John 13 and verse number 1

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
as our title this morning.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It says this in John 13 and verse number 1,

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now before the feast of the Passover,

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
when Jesus knew that his hour was come,

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
having loved his own which were in the world,

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
notice this phrase, he loved them unto the end.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He loved them unto the end.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The truth of John 13 and verse number 1,

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that phrase, he loved them unto the end,

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that's our title for the message this morning,

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and this phrase carries with it not only to the very last,

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but it also carries with it the idea of loving them to the uttermost,

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of loving them completely.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's nothing lacking in God's love that he has for his people,

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and we find here that in John 13 and verse number 1,

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and before we get into the thoughts of the message this morning,

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want you to understand as John is writing this,

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
again under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and following the timeline of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that at this particular time, the Bible reveals to us,

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
notice in verse number 1 again, when Jesus knew that his hour was come.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you're not very familiar with the book of John, the gospel of John,

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
it's important for us to understand that this phrase about God's hour,

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
his hour, is repeated throughout the gospel of John.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You find that it begins in John chapter number 2,

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
where the Bible says this was the first miracle,

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and it says that his hour was not yet come.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The beginning of his earthly ministry,

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that first miracle at the marriage at Cana,

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and we find that John 2 reveals to us on that very first time in the gospel of John

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
with regard to this concept, this idea of the hour,

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and it says his hour was not yet come.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Again, you find as you go through the page of the book of John,

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the gospel of John about the hour,

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and he says in John chapter 12 and verse number 23,

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it says, and Jesus answered them saying,

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the hour is come that the Son of Man shall be glorified,

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and then in John 13 and verse number 1,

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the Bible says when Jesus knew that his hour was come,

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
notice what he knew, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There was only one way for him to depart out of this world unto the Father,

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and we understand that he came to finish the work,

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and that work was the cross of Calvary.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He would go to that cruel cross.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He would suffer, bleed, and die.

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He would be buried in a borrowed tomb,

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and he would rise conquering sin, death, and the grave.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
After his resurrection, he would make himself known for 40 days

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
before he would ascend to heaven,

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
awaiting his soon return.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm thankful that he's there.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's interceding for us.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We understand that he will come again.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He gives that promise in John chapter number 14 and verse number 1,

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
down through verse number 3,

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but we find that he had this knowledge that his hour was come.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He's preparing his disciples for his departure.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
As you study through this portion of the gospel of John,

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you eventually come to chapter number 17,

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
where the Bible simply declares it this way,

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Father, the hour is come.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What's he referring to?

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That hour, that time period in which he would go to the cross.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And in knowing that the hour was come,

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
having loved his own which were in the world,

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the Holy Spirit led the writer, John,

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to write these words that he, Christ, loved them unto the end.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Completely.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
To the uttermost.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
To the very last.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to think about this subject of God's great love for us.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,519
in this truth here in John 13 in verse number one,

193
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,920
that he loved them unto the end.

194
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,360
I'm mindful of the truth this morning

195
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,880
that there are times in our lives

196
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,359
in which we can doubt the love of God.

197
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,640
There are times in our lives

198
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,319
where maybe we use the wrong things

199
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:18,680
to try to measure God's love for us.

200
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,840
In fact, there's a song that,

201
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,239
I believe his brother, Mike Clark,

202
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,520
sang the song about that Jesus said, I love you.

203
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,760
And the reality is in that song, he says this,

204
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,400
some measure God's love by the things that they have.

205
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
That's a wrong measuring unit,

206
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,319
a unit of measuring God's love.

207
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:42,959
But some people are led to believe

208
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,439
that if things are going well,

209
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:47,200
if I have this and I have that and so on and so forth,

210
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
that God must love me.

211
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,400
We have a real hard time reading the book of Job.

212
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,279
God's love for you and God's love for me

213
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,639
is not measured by our possessions.

214
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,360
It's not measured by our possession, our position.

215
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
No, it's not measured by those things.

216
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
God's love for us is settled because he said, I love you.

217
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,879
And he demonstrated, he showed us that great love

218
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,559
when he went to the cross of Calvary.

219
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,639
There are times in the lives even of God's people

220
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,839
that we can go through some circumstances

221
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
and some situations and we can have that grief,

222
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,680
we can have that anxiety that Dean spoke of or sang of,

223
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,720
we can have those things that are going on in our lives

224
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,199
and we can wonder, does God really love me?

225
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,199
Does he know where I am?

226
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,599
I feel alone, I feel, I begin to doubt.

227
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,919
And I tell you that there is an enemy that you have

228
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,040
and one of the titles of our enemy, our adversary,

229
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,639
the devil, is that he is the accuser of the brethren.

230
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,680
And so in those very moments of life

231
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,279
and those difficult, dark times

232
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,760
when things seem to not be going the way

233
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,879
that you thought they'd go,

234
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,279
when you seem like, as the psalmist would say,

235
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,919
I'm all alone and what might be going on,

236
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,279
it's in those times even as you would doubt

237
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,519
that the enemy, the accuser of the brethren

238
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,959
would love to come next to you and say,

239
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,199
see, does God really love you?

240
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,119
Does God really love you?

241
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,119
He wants us to doubt it.

242
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,360
And I'm here to tell you this morning

243
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,199
that we should never doubt God's love.

244
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,639
We should never doubt the love of God.

245
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,240
I've said this in messages this year a few times

246
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,119
and it's worth repeating that we should never

247
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,559
put a question mark where God puts a period,

248
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,039
where God has revealed truth to us,

249
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,000
where he has declared clearly his stated truth to us.

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,039
We should never doubt,

251
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,679
though our circumstances may be difficult,

252
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,199
though it seems as if maybe the enemy is rising against us

253
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,679
that we must rest in knowing

254
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,080
what God has told us in his word.

255
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,240
So when we think about this subject this morning,

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,080
that he loved them unto the end,

257
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,639
and thinking about his great love for us,

258
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,520
let me share with you a few thoughts.

259
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
Number one, I would say this

260
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,759
when you think about the love of God,

261
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,520
that we must remind ourselves of his love for us.

262
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,080
Can I say to you personally this morning

263
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,720
that you should remind yourself that God loves you?

264
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
You should remind yourself of that.

265
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,119
You say, really, that seems kind of silly, pastor,

266
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,759
to say I should remind myself.

267
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,919
Well, there are people in God's word

268
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,039
that remind themselves that God loved them.

269
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,520
And I believe that it's important for us

270
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,960
to remind ourselves.

271
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,679
See, we go through the difficult times,

272
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,240
we go through the challenges,

273
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
that we remind ourselves that God loves me.

274
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,279
God loves me.

275
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,240
It might be difficult, it might be dark,

276
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,839
it might be dreary, it might seem as if,

277
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,279
no, but God loves me.

278
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,479
And his love is a perfect love.

279
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,600
His love is an unconditional.

280
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,320
We talk about all those descriptive terms,

281
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
and we remind ourselves that God loves us.

282
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
Let me remind you of what John says.

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,639
Turn back to John.

284
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,080
You might still be there in chapter 13.

285
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,639
Look over in verse number 23.

286
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,960
And we notice this throughout the book of John.

287
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,119
I love the way that John refers to himself.

288
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,199
Again, it's under the inspiration

289
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,479
of the Holy Spirit of God.

290
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,360
And so we know that it's not John

291
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,119
just coming up with this phraseology.

292
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,559
But I want you to see what the Bible says.

293
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,679
In John chapter number 13, in verse number 21,

294
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,520
the Bible says, when Jesus had thus said,

295
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,960
he was troubled in spirit and testified,

296
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,720
and said, verily, verily, I say unto you

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,640
that one of you shall betray me.

298
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,440
This is after he'd washed their feet.

299
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
In chapter number 13, it's revealed to us

300
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,640
where the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

301
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,000
washes the feet of the disciples,

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
including him that would deny him.

303
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,179
Him, that being Peter, of course, would deny him.

304
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,880
But also you think about Judas, who would betray him.

305
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,380
He washes their feet.

306
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,920
And he reveals here in verse number 21 about the betrayal.

307
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,079
And then the Bible says this.

308
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,839
Then the disciples looked one to another,

309
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,320
doubting of whom he spake.

310
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,839
Now there was leaning on Jesus's bosom,

311
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,880
one of his disciples, notice what the Bible says,

312
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
whom Jesus loved.

313
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Now that could be true of all the disciples, could it not?

314
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,839
Jesus loved them.

315
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,239
But who's it talking about personally?

316
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,640
John.

317
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
Isn't that amazing to you?

318
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,359
It's amazing to me how John refers to himself

319
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:14,760
in the Gospel of John as the one whom Jesus loved.

320
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
I think there's good reason for John

321
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,359
to refer to himself that way.

322
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:22,040
It's a good reminder that God loves me.

323
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,559
Whom Jesus loved.

324
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,399
Notice over in chapter 19, in verse number 26,

325
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,839
here we find that Jesus is there on the cross of Calvary.

326
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,839
He's already gone through the trial before Caiaphas.

327
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,279
He stood before Pilate.

328
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,600
The crucifixion has begun.

329
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,239
He's walked up the hill called Calvary.

330
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,480
He's there upon the cross, and the Bible tells us

331
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,760
in verse number 25, now there stood by the cross of Jesus

332
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,679
his mother, his mother's sister, Mary,

333
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,600
the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.

334
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
When Jesus therefore saw his mother

335
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,600
and the disciples standing by whom he loved,

336
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,359
he said unto his mother, woman, behold thy son.

337
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,040
Again, talking about John.

338
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
He saw that disciple.

339
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,160
He said, and the disciples standing by whom he loved.

340
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,279
In chapter 20, as it's the truth of the resurrection,

341
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,399
Jesus has been crucified, he's been buried,

342
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,799
and the first day of the week comes,

343
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,640
and the Bible tells us in verse number one

344
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,720
that Mary Magdalene went early down to the tomb,

345
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,760
and it was dark, and unto the sepulcher,

346
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,079
and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.

347
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,320
Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter,

348
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,220
and to the other disciple, notice whom Jesus loved.

349
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,059
You can read it in chapter 21, in verse number seven,

350
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,299
when they're out there on the ship.

351
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,339
Remember, Peter said, I go a-fishing.

352
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,100
And the other disciples said, we're coming with you.

353
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,980
And Jesus appears on the ship,

354
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,899
and he calls out in verse number five,

355
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,779
children, have ye any meat?

356
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,660
Now the worst question that you could be asked

357
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,140
as a fisherman when you've caught nothing

358
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,660
is how's the catch?

359
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,739
They've caught nothing.

360
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:15,779
Jesus, the resurrected Savior, standing there on the shore,

361
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,260
asks that question, and they reply by saying no.

362
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,100
He then tells them to cast the net

363
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,059
on the right side of the ship, and you shall find

364
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,660
they obeyed, they cast, therefore,

365
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,980
now they were not able to draw it

366
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
for the multitude of fishes,

367
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,459
and verse seven tells us this of John 21,

368
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:36,100
therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved,

369
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,140
saith unto Peter, it is the Lord.

370
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,059
It is the Lord.

371
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,459
And I'm thankful that John reminded himself.

372
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,739
You can look at verse 20 of John chapter 21,

373
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,339
but we'll keep moving along.

374
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,380
We find that the Bible reveals to us in the gospel of John

375
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,660
where John reminds himself, he refers to himself

376
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,100
as the one whom Jesus loved,

377
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,140
that disciple whom Jesus loved.

378
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,420
I want you to think about the apostle Paul.

379
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,700
It was over in the book of Galatians, if you will.

380
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,540
Galatians chapter number two.

381
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,459
See, the apostle Paul reminded himself that God loved him.

382
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:19,100
Paul was a man who was religious, but lost.

383
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,739
When he first comes on the pages of Scripture,

384
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,100
his name is Saul.

385
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,420
He's persecuting the church.

386
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,019
He's looking for any that be of that way.

387
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:29,339
We find that on a road to Damascus, he meets the Lord.

388
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,859
It's in that place that his life is forever changed.

389
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,619
Who art thou, Lord?

390
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,539
And Jesus reveals himself to him and he says,

391
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:38,859
what wilt thou have me to do?

392
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,900
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

393
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:44,580
We find that his name would soon be changed to Paul

394
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,419
and we refer to him as Paul.

395
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,260
And we look here in Galatians chapter two

396
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,179
and he's writing to these that he'd had the opportunity

397
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,299
to minister to during his first missionary journey.

398
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,059
And he shares this great testimony with them

399
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,820
in verse number 20, a verse that many of us

400
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,780
have memorized in our lives.

401
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,619
When he says this, I am crucified with Christ.

402
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

403
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,780
The life which I now live in the flesh,

404
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,539
I live by the faith of the Son of God,

405
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:17,020
notice this, who loved me and gave himself for me.

406
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,260
I believe that the Apostle Paul,

407
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,500
as he would even write this, of course,

408
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,979
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

409
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:27,820
but he's writing back to the churches

410
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,039
in the region of Galatia that he has this opportunity

411
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,000
to be able to share with them that truth,

412
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,559
that reminder that Jesus loved me.

413
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,000
And he proved that love for me

414
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,760
by going to the cross of Calvary for me.

415
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,280
We find in the book of Ephesians in the third chapter,

416
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,919
notice what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter number three,

417
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,080
Paul is now writing to the believers in Ephesus

418
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,840
and we find that he's written to the churches

419
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,919
there in Galatia, the region of Galatia,

420
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,359
and reminded them as he's even reminding himself

421
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,039
that Jesus loved him, but now as he's writing

422
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,979
to the church in Ephesus and to these believers

423
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:06,379
on two occasions in the book of Ephesians,

424
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,259
the Apostle Paul records and reveals

425
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:12,299
to the believers in Ephesus how he was praying for them.

426
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,579
In chapter number three, it's the second record

427
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:18,379
of that prayer that the Apostle Paul would reveal.

428
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,619
And it's interesting to me and it's noteworthy

429
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,299
and I believe exemplary for us to understand

430
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,619
that as Paul would say to people that I'm praying for you,

431
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:28,759
that he also said, here's how I'm praying for you.

432
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,819
It's an encouraging thing to know

433
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,239
that somebody is praying for you,

434
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,719
but how encouraging it is to know

435
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,599
how they're praying for you, specifically.

436
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,559
By the way, when you look at the prayers

437
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,079
of the Apostle Paul that are recorded

438
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,419
within the pages of this book,

439
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,479
we find that Paul always was praying for people

440
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,879
with regard to their spiritual well-being.

441
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,359
Notice he says this, we won't take the time

442
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,199
to look at the entirety of the prayer,

443
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,519
but we notice that in verse number 15,

444
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,299
he begins to pray.

445
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,619
Verse 14 says, for this cause I bow my knees

446
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,299
unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

447
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,019
He's praying for these believers.

448
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:06,739
But notice where he says in verse number 18

449
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,359
that you may be able to comprehend with all saints

450
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,099
what is the breadth and length and depth and height

451
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:16,299
and to know the love of Christ,

452
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,819
which passeth knowledge that you might be filled

453
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,959
with all the fullness of God.

454
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,259
I believe that even as the Apostle Paul

455
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:27,679
would pray for others to understand,

456
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,919
to know the love of Christ,

457
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,559
that that in of itself was a reminder for him

458
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,859
as to how much God loved him.

459
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,159
You know, when you're teaching somebody else,

460
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,239
when you're praying for somebody else,

461
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,639
you're also reminding yourself of the very truth

462
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,879
that you're seeking to give.

463
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,619
We find here that the Apostle Paul says,

464
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,219
I want you, Church at Ephesus,

465
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:52,219
I want you believers to know the love of Christ.

466
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,319
He would tell them in chapter number five

467
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,679
how that Christ demonstrated that love

468
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,319
as he would give that charge, that admonition

469
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,439
to the husbands to love your wives.

470
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:05,359
And he says this, even as Christ also loved the church

471
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,079
and gave himself for it.

472
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,919
What a great reminder of God's great love.

473
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,439
This morning, I believe it's important

474
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,919
that we would remind ourselves that God loves us.

475
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,399
Turn back to the book of John, if you will,

476
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:20,919
in the 11th chapter.

477
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,619
In John chapter number 11.

478
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:34,019
The passage of Scripture reveals to us an event

479
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,119
in the life of those that Jesus loved.

480
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:41,379
Lazarus dies in John chapter number 11.

481
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,339
Lazarus is sick to start the chapter.

482
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,019
We find that Mary and Martha, his sisters,

483
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,119
going to send word to the Lord Jesus Christ.

484
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,719
And the Bible begins in verse number one

485
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,639
and says, now a certain man was sick named Lazarus

486
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:01,219
of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

487
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:03,239
Was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment

488
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,699
and wiped his feet with her hair,

489
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,559
whose brother Lazarus was sick?

490
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,359
Notice verse number three,

491
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,499
therefore his sister sent unto him, saying, Lord.

492
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:15,299
I want you to understand, they sent to Jesus this message

493
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,779
because they understood some things about Jesus.

494
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,119
One thing that's revealed to us,

495
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,719
we'll read in just a moment in verse number three,

496
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,099
but I also believe that they understood

497
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:25,159
that Jesus could do something about it.

498
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,059
They didn't believe that, they wouldn't have sent for Jesus.

499
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,499
They sent for Jesus and notice the Bible says,

500
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:38,499
behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

501
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,039
Isn't that interesting to you?

502
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,919
They could have said Lazarus is sick.

503
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,899
But the messengers are given this message

504
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:53,899
to deliver to Jesus, he whom thou lovest is sick.

505
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,199
Now, did Jesus need a reminder that he loved Lazarus?

506
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,039
No.

507
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,679
You think Mary and Martha might have needed a reminder

508
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,699
that Lazarus was loved by God?

509
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:11,339
When he was sick, the circumstances seemed dim.

510
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:15,939
Maybe the doctors have, the text doesn't tell us,

511
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,239
it's an assumption.

512
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:21,139
But I understand as I would think about our own lives

513
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,419
and I think about the circumstances that we deal with,

514
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,619
and we could hear news and we could understand

515
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,819
and maybe just even from our own perspective,

516
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,479
there are times in which you've seen some people, no doubt,

517
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,779
where you look at their condition,

518
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,919
you look at their health, you look at some injury

519
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,119
and you say, oh, that's no big deal, you'll be fine.

520
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,619
But other times you say, that's a serious matter.

521
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,619
We find that the Bible says, he whom thou lovest is sick.

522
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,479
When Jesus heard that, he said,

523
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:51,219
this sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God,

524
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,219
that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

525
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,419
Then the Bible tells us this, John writing again

526
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:57,899
with the inspirational Holy Spirit of God,

527
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:02,899
now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

528
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,999
I believe that God's love for them was obvious,

529
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,599
they knew it, they were aware of God's love

530
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,079
for them personally.

531
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,599
We can read of the times, the interactions personally

532
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,799
as you study through the Gospels

533
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,279
that they had one with another

534
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,139
and we understand that it was obvious to them,

535
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:20,679
it was known by them.

536
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,439
They're able to say, he whom thou lovest is sick.

537
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,119
But I want you to understand that not only was it known

538
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,979
or obvious to them, but it was known even by others

539
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:32,079
as Jesus would stand at that tomb and he would weep.

540
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,439
The Bible says that the Jews that were gathered there

541
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:39,359
in verse number 36 said, behold, how he loved him.

542
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,199
How he loved him.

543
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,079
This morning, as we begin to think about God's great love

544
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,599
for us and begin to think about the truth

545
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,279
that he loved them unto the end,

546
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,399
that we understand that God loves us.

547
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,399
This morning, there may be some times in your life

548
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:03,399
that you're prone to drift and wander in doubt.

549
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:06,199
Maybe you're going through a difficult time.

550
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,039
And in the midst of that difficulty,

551
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,119
the accuser of the brethren comes

552
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,419
and begins to whisper some things in your ear.

553
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,799
You can begin to doubt the love of God.

554
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,739
I would tell you this morning that we must remind ourselves,

555
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:26,739
regularly remind ourselves, God loves me, God loves me.

556
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:32,219
The little song that we sing in Sunday school,

557
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:37,219
Jesus loves me, this I know.

558
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:44,379
For the Bible tells me so, right?

559
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:49,099
It doesn't say Jesus loves me, this I know,

560
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,419
because everything's going well and I have all of these.

561
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,779
No, no, no, the Bible tells me so.

562
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,619
I remind myself that God loves me.

563
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,539
Number two this morning, I would say this,

564
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,139
rest in his love for you, rest in his love.

565
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:08,979
Sometimes we get so anxious about things in life.

566
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,379
Sometimes we're just overwhelmed.

567
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,259
The psalmist says when I'm overwhelmed,

568
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,819
and you can read through the Psalms,

569
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:18,219
you can read many times when the psalmist is overwhelmed

570
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,579
and he's transparent, and the problem sometimes

571
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:23,139
that we have in our own lives is we fail

572
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,119
on that part of transparency.

573
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,179
We can pretend and put up this facade

574
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,659
like we got everything together,

575
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,619
but we're really breaking inside and we're overwhelmed

576
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,139
and we have anxiety and grief and whatever,

577
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:37,499
and we must simply learn to rest in his love.

578
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,499
See, when we have reminded ourselves that God loves us,

579
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,179
that enables us to rest in his love.

580
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:48,539
Because when I understand that God loves me,

581
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,299
when I've reminded myself, I can rest in it

582
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,019
knowing that he has my best interest in mind,

583
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,439
that he always does that which is right.

584
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,239
Listen, God never makes a mistake.

585
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,879
Nothing ever surprises him.

586
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,719
He's never taken off guard.

587
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:06,719
He loves me and he loves you, and I must rest in that.

588
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,539
I must rest in that.

589
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,359
Listen, we understand what it is to love one another.

590
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,199
Do we not?

591
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,199
We have children, we love our children.

592
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,959
We have spouses, we love our spouse.

593
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,179
We understand what it is to love one another.

594
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,359
God's love is so much greater than our love.

595
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,839
If you love your children,

596
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,599
you want them to know that you love them.

597
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,959
You want them to be able to rest in that love.

598
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,039
You don't want them running around day by day

599
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,639
scratching their head wondering, does daddy love me?

600
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,259
Does mommy love me?

601
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,079
No, you want them to rest in that.

602
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,239
You want them to be assured of that.

603
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,199
You want them to know that they can come to you

604
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:48,279
and that they know that you love them.

605
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:53,000
Your spouse, listen, a spouse should never have to doubt

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,659
whether their spouse loves them.

607
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,739
They should be able to rest in that.

608
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,679
They should have that great peace of knowing

609
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,359
that my spouse loves me.

610
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:10,559
Just turn to the book of Romans, if you will.

611
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,559
In Romans chapter number eight,

612
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,559
great picture, I believe, of resting in God's love for us.

613
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,399
I've reminded myself that God loves me.

614
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,440
You see, the storm is raging.

615
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,320
The difficulties are real.

616
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
The anxiety level is high, but God loves me.

617
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,959
But God loves me, and I'm gonna rest in that.

618
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,259
See, when I understand all of who God is,

619
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,380
and all of his great power, and his wisdom, and his plan,

620
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,899
it enables me to rest.

621
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,839
We find in Romans chapter number eight in verse number 31,

622
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:54,000
the Bible says, what shall we then say to these things?

623
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,139
If God be for us, who can be against us?

624
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:02,439
He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all,

625
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:07,639
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

626
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,639
Aren't you thankful for his love, as it's even referred to in verse number 32,

627
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,639
though you do not see the word love,

628
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,639
but when you read about the fact that he delivered him up for us all,

629
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:21,139
speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ, that's the truth of John 3, 16,

630
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:25,139
for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.

631
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,639
We find in verse number 33, notice what the Bible says,

632
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,139
who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?

633
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:33,639
It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?

634
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:37,639
It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again,

635
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:41,639
who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

636
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:48,639
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

637
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:58,139
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,

638
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:06,139
or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

639
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:10,139
As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long,

640
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:15,139
we are counted as sheep for the slaughter, nay, in all these things.

641
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:22,639
We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

642
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,639
For I am persuaded.

643
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:32,639
I'm thankful for that word, that phrase that Paul uses.

644
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:39,639
He says that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,

645
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,139
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

646
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:49,139
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature

647
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:53,139
shall be able to separate us from the love of God,

648
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:58,139
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

649
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:02,139
That's a recipe for resting in God's love right there.

650
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,139
Honestly.

651
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,139
You say, but pastor, this thing's going on.

652
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:09,139
Read it again.

653
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:12,639
I love the fact, obviously it's God's word,

654
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,639
and all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

655
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,639
but he goes through all these things that are not going to be able to separate us,

656
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:20,639
but then just in case somebody would come along and try to fit something in,

657
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,639
he says, nor any other creature.

658
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:27,639
Listen, there's nothing that's going to separate you from the love of God.

659
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,639
And we rest in it.

660
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,639
Listen, you understand this morning,

661
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:35,639
I was thinking about this this morning as I was just meditating on the message

662
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:40,139
that I'd be preaching today and thinking about and reminding myself of his great love for us.

663
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:44,139
You know, the very truth I was reading in the book of Proverbs

664
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:46,139
and then also over the book of Hebrews,

665
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:50,139
and the very truth for us to understand this morning is that the reason,

666
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:53,139
listen, when God corrects us,

667
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,139
we talk about chastisement in the life of a believer,

668
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,139
you know that that's because he loves us.

669
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:05,139
Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, he correcteth.

670
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:08,639
And so we understand this morning

671
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:11,639
that as all these things are going on in our lives

672
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,639
and all of this turmoil that we can be faced with,

673
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,639
that we remind ourselves that God loves me personally,

674
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:23,639
but then I make that decision that I'm going to rest in his love for me.

675
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:26,639
It's a settled truth.

676
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,639
There's not going to be any doubt of God's love.

677
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:33,639
Because God's love is not based on your circumstances or on my circumstances,

678
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:40,139
just as it's true when we say the statement that God is good.

679
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:43,139
He's good.

680
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,139
All the time.

681
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:50,139
Ms. Gloria Long, she's not able to attend here regularly anymore.

682
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:53,139
I believe she watches on livestream regularly.

683
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:57,139
She sends a note to me every month, sends a little greeting card.

684
00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:00,139
Let me know how she's doing. I talk to her on the phone occasionally.

685
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:05,139
But here's what she says in almost every correspondence I have with her,

686
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:08,139
whether it's on the phone or on a card.

687
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:14,139
She says this, God is good all the time.

688
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,139
And it's in correspondence, all is always capitalized and underlined.

689
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,139
God is good all the time.

690
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,139
And I often say this, and all the time, God is good.

691
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,139
Even if it's a verbal correspondence.

692
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,139
God's goodness is not based on your circumstances.

693
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,139
God is good. He's a good God.

694
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,139
And we know, John 8 and verse number 28, the same chapter that we're looking in,

695
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,139
the verses that precede what we just looked at,

696
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,139
and we know that all things work together for what?

697
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,139
For good!

698
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,139
To them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.

699
00:34:54,139 --> 00:35:00,139
And you say, I have no idea how all of this mess is going to turn out for good.

700
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,139
Can I just encourage you to read this book?

701
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:06,139
Because there's a whole lot of things in this book that are a mess,

702
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:10,139
that God turns into good.

703
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:12,139
God is good.

704
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:16,139
And we must rest in His love.

705
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,139
This is going on, that's going on.

706
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,139
Did you read this? Did you hear about that?

707
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:23,139
Did you see this? Did you...

708
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,139
God loves me.

709
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,139
And I'm going to rest in His love.

710
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:31,139
It's a decision that you have to make.

711
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,139
It's a decision that you have to make.

712
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:36,139
You have to remind yourself, and then you have to rest.

713
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,139
You have to rest.

714
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,139
I would say this, finally, this morning, very quickly.

715
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,139
We ought to rejoice for His great love.

716
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:50,139
We ought to have overwhelming joy to know that God loves us.

717
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:54,139
To know the details that God has given to us in His Word

718
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:56,139
with regard to how He has loved us,

719
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:58,139
and how He's described that love for us.

720
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,139
And the reminder, man, it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

721
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,139
Think about what John says in the book of 1 John, in chapter 3.

722
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:09,139
I believe even as he's writing here to these believers

723
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,139
that are being addressed in the book of 1 John,

724
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:15,139
that it's also a period of time of rejoicing,

725
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,139
even the life of John as he's penning these words.

726
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:21,139
And I think about these men that God would use

727
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,139
to pen the words of Scripture

728
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,139
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

729
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:27,139
And I think about as they're penning these words

730
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,139
how God is working and moving and reminding,

731
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:32,139
and how there's a period of rejoicing.

732
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:34,139
But we find that John begins again

733
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:36,139
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

734
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,139
The chapter divisions and verses have been added for our benefit.

735
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,139
But in our Bibles, in John 3, in verse number 1

736
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,139
of the book of 1 John, it says,

737
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,139
Notice when he says,

738
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,139
Why does he say us? Because he's writing to believers.

739
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:01,139
The book of 1 John is a book that's written to believers.

740
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:04,139
And he's saying, listen, what manner of love

741
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,139
the Father hath bestowed upon us.

742
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,139
He's including himself.

743
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:11,139
That idea of that word manner is really the sort of

744
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:14,139
or the quality of the type of love.

745
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:18,139
What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.

746
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,139
Notice what it says,

747
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:27,139
It's absolutely amazing.

748
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:30,139
It's reason to rejoice that God's love.

749
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:32,139
What manner of love.

750
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:33,139
It says,

751
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:40,139
In 1 John chapter number 4, notice he says it this way

752
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:42,139
in verses 7 through 10 again.

753
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,139
This period of rejoicing, if you will,

754
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,139
with regard to knowing the love of God.

755
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:01,139
And this was manifested, the love of God toward us.

756
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:05,139
Because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world

757
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,139
that we might live through him.

758
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,139
Here in his love.

759
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:11,139
Not that we love God.

760
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:13,139
But that he loved us.

761
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:18,139
And sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

762
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,139
Listen, if that doesn't cause you to rejoice,

763
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,139
I don't know what will.

764
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,139
Honestly.

765
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:26,139
I don't know what would cause you to rejoice

766
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,139
if that doesn't.

767
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,139
See, we think sometimes about this idea of rejoicing

768
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:33,139
and we can read of people, we can read articles

769
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:36,139
and we can see videos of people that seem to have

770
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,139
this great level of excitement and joy

771
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,139
with regard to some great spoil that they've received,

772
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:46,139
some great windfall of good luck, quote unquote,

773
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:49,139
that they've been able to encounter and so on and so forth.

774
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:52,139
But I want you to think about the word of God

775
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,139
and how often throughout the pages of scripture,

776
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,139
the psalmist in particular, he speaks about having

777
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,139
gladness and joy, not in those things,

778
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,139
but in knowing who God is.

779
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:06,139
And he says this, I was just reading this

780
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,139
just the other day, in Psalm 4 and verse number 7,

781
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,139
thou hast put gladness in my heart

782
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,139
more than in the time that their corn

783
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:16,139
and their wine increased.

784
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:19,139
Listen, they had this gladness when they had that

785
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:23,139
good crop and that good fortune, if you will.

786
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:27,139
But God's put gladness in my heart that exceeds that.

787
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:30,139
What great imagery that we see.

788
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:34,139
Read in the book of Psalms, Psalm 119.

789
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,139
The longest chapter in all of the Bible.

790
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,139
You read about how the psalmist, he finds truth,

791
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:44,139
and he says I rejoice, even as those that find great spoil.

792
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:46,139
They find this great spoil and there's reason

793
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,139
for them to have joy and to rejoice.

794
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:52,139
But no, we're rejoicing because God loves me.

795
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,139
Because God loves me.

796
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,139
Herein is love.

797
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:06,579
Not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for

798
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:07,579
our sins.

799
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:11,659
You know our greatest need is to have a Savior.

800
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,539
The greatest need of mankind is a Savior.

801
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,899
The greatest need of mankind is not more money.

802
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:22,139
People think that.

803
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,899
People promise that.

804
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,379
They do.

805
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:34,379
You do this, we'll give you this, you'll be better off, so on and so forth.

806
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:37,699
The greatest need is not money.

807
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:45,739
The greatest need of humankind is salvation, the Savior, and God met that need.

808
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:48,859
The greatest need is not education.

809
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,739
We could just keep going down the list.

810
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:55,299
The greatest need is salvation.

811
00:40:55,299 --> 00:41:00,459
I believe this morning as I look at this message, and I'm not saying this because I developed

812
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:05,539
the message, but I believe this morning God gave me, He taught me a truth as I was preparing

813
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:09,579
this message, and it's this.

814
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:12,659
There's really a cycle in this message.

815
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,299
As I'm rejoicing in God's love for me, guess what I'm doing?

816
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:24,699
I'm reminding myself that God loves me because I'm rejoicing in it, and as I'm rejoicing

817
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:29,539
in it, I'm reminding myself that God loves me, and as I'm reminding myself that God loves

818
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,859
me, you know what I'm doing?

819
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:34,079
I'm resting in God's love.

820
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:41,079
As I'm resting in God's love, I'm rejoicing that God loves me.

821
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:49,439
When I'm rejoicing that God loves me, I'm reminding myself that God loves me, and I'm

822
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:58,839
resting in the fact that God loves me, and it's a cycle, and it's a good cycle, and

823
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:05,519
this morning, I'm so glad, as the songwriter said, I'm so glad that Jesus loves me.

824
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,719
Jesus loves even me.

825
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,719
Oh, wonderful things in the Bible I see.

826
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:17,199
There's some amazing truth that God gives us in his word, but this is the dearest, that

827
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,359
Jesus loves me.

828
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:27,439
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, and when I remind myself, when you remind yourself, you begin

829
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:37,439
to rest in his love, you rejoice because he loves you, and it just is a cycle.

830
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:45,519
We go through life never doubting God's love for us, never being overwhelmed with the grief,

831
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:53,159
the anxiety, the pressures, the troubles, because God loves me, and God knows what's

832
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,159
best.

833
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,719
Do you believe that this morning?

834
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,719
I believe that.

835
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,719
God knows what's best.

836
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,239
I believe that God has a plan, and we always see that God's plan is better than your plan

837
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:04,239
or my plan.

838
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,599
You say, well, if I was planning this, I'd do this different.

839
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,399
Yup, and it would fail.

840
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:14,439
Let God be God and rest in his love.

841
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:15,439
Let's pray together.

842
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,679
Father, we love you.

843
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,939
We thank you for loving us.

844
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:30,559
This revealed truth is a familiar truth.

845
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,399
We sing often about your love.

846
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:41,959
In fact, we started our service this morning singing a song about your great love.

847
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:44,759
Lord I pray that you'd help your people this morning.

848
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:51,759
God, you know the needs that are represented in this room, those that are tuned in via

849
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,679
live stream.

850
00:43:53,679 --> 00:44:01,959
Lord, perhaps there are some that have been overwhelmed, that have that anxiety that Dean

851
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:11,879
sang about, facing difficulties and troubles and just overwhelmed.

852
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:17,759
Maybe because of some of those circumstances, they've even begun to doubt your love.

853
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,999
The adversary is working overtime, the accuser, the brethren.

854
00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:30,959
God, I pray that in this moment, in this day, we would determine, we're going to remind

855
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:38,079
ourselves regularly that you love us.

856
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:47,119
Like the Apostle John, maybe we'd begin referring to ourselves the one that Jesus loves, that

857
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,759
we'd learn to rest in your love.

858
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,839
It's a decision that we must make.

859
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,919
God help us to rejoice.

860
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:01,319
Though we're sinners, you love us.

861
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,719
We don't deserve it.

862
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,839
You love us with an amazing love.

863
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,439
God, I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives this morning.

864
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:16,959
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never been saved, they've never trusted

865
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:22,279
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, they do not have 100% confidence that heaven

866
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:23,279
is their home.

867
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:26,479
God, I pray that you'd work in their heart this morning.

868
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:30,279
Help them to know that you love them and you died for them so they could be saved.

869
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:36,199
Their greatest need in this hour is salvation, all that they would trust Christ as their

870
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,199
Savior today.

871
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,519
Would you move and work as only you can, have your will and way.

872
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:43,319
Well, thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

873
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,319
Would you stand with me?

874
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,319
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

875
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,039
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, we'll give you an opportunity

876
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,039
to respond.

877
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,559
Maybe you want to make your seat an altar, maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned

878
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,559
altar this morning.

879
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,759
Maybe you just want to come and thank God for His love.

880
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,279
Maybe you've been struggling with some things.

881
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:01,639
Just remind yourself that God loves you.

882
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,399
Rejoice in His love.

883
00:46:03,399 --> 00:46:04,959
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
