WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And our theme for this year is Great is the Lord,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we've been dealing with various aspects from God's Word,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
how God has revealed to us His greatness.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it's a wonderful thing, as the psalmist has declared in other portions of Scripture,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or read the Bible says, of those that knew they understood,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
they were aware of the fact that God is great.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I believe, as I've mentioned many times throughout this calendar year,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that each of us that are gathered here this morning,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that if we were to be asked individually,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
do you know, do you believe that God is great?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I believe that we would answer, yes, we know that God is great.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then we begin to try to answer the question as to,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
well, why is God great?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Describe for me His greatness.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And we've looked at a number of things,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we've spoken about God's great power, God's great wisdom.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And a few weeks ago, we dealt with the subject of His great love.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In the book of Ephesians, in the second chapter,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we read of that very statement that God, who is rich in mercy with His great love,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
wherewith He loved us.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I'm so thankful for the love of God.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
During that particular message, and it was several weeks ago now,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we've had Mother's Day and Missions Conference and other things going on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It was several weeks ago that we dealt with that subject matter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But we ended the message by saying that not only is God's love declared and demonstrated,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but we said that God's love is described or defined.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I went through a number of verses of Scripture,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I gave you seven descriptive terms of God's love.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I'll just very quickly reveal those or review those to you this morning.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I said this, that God's love is described in these seven ways.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Number one, it's great love.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Number two, it's everlasting love.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Number three, it's sacrificial love.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I'm thankful for the sacrifice that the Lord Jesus Christ made on the cross of Calvary.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I said this, number four, that it's unconditional.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And I'm thankful that God loves us, that God loves me in spite of myself,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
my failures, all of the things.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
God loves us. It's unconditional.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I said this, God's love is universal.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
For God so loved the world.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm thankful that the truth of God's word is that God is not willing that any should perish,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but that all should come to repentance, and that God loves everyone.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It is a universal love.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There are people that we can come in contact with every day of our lives,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we can rest assured in knowing this truth that God loves them.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You say, but they're a sinner. They're not lovable.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're this, so were you, so am I.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And God loves, and we're so thankful that His love is universal.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But then I said this, God's love is personal.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
God's love is personal.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's amazing to understand that God loves the world,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and we look at that, and we think about the large number of population,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and that God loves every single person who loves the world.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But then we bring it to our own selves and say, but God loves me as an individual.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
He loves me personally.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And then I said that God's love can be described as being protective.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So many today would like to describe or pretend to describe that God's love is permissive.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Well, God loves me, and therefore He's okay with this, that, and the other thing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the reality is that God's love is protective,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and we ought to be mindful of that and understand that truth this morning.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And so we talked about His great love,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and we looked at those truths from God's word with how God's love is described or defined for us.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And we spoke about that wonderful song that's in our songbook,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I Am So Glad That Jesus Loves Me, Jesus Loves Even Me.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The reality is that the songwriter said, wonderful things in the Bible I see.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There are some amazing things that you read in God's word.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm so thankful that God's given us this precious book, the Bible.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But this is the dearest, is what the songwriter said,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
this is the dearest that Jesus loves me.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I think about the subject of God's love.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's a fascinating study.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're blessed to know this powerful truth.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
There are countless millions of people, perhaps even this morning we would say

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
countless billions of people upon the face of the earth today

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that have never heard, do not understand the very basic truth

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that we're dealing with this morning that God loves them.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You know, you can talk to people today that you come into contact with.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We live in a place, in an area in Northern Virginia

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
where it seems as if almost every country of the world is represented in our backyard.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's such a diverse area, and I love it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I think it's absolutely wonderful.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We've been able to learn so many wonderful things

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and be able to interact with people from different places.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But the reality is that I talk to people sometimes,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and because of where they are from, because of where they grew up,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because of being steeped in some cult or religion,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
they've never heard the basic truth that God loves them.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They don't understand what it means.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And this morning we can rest assured and we can have great joy in our hearts

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
with knowing this great truth that He loves me.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Understand this morning that He loves you not because you deserve His love.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
None of us are deserving of His love.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But He chooses to love us.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He chose to love us.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
He is love.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
For that we ought to rejoice.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
John was a man of God that was used by God.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
He's one of the apostles, and John was privileged to have the opportunity

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to be the human penman.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We know that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but we also know that God used men,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
holy men of God, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and God used the apostle John to pen the book of John

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and also the three letters, the epistles, if you will,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that also bear his name, 1st, 2nd, 3rd John,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and then also the book of Revelation.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And what a blessing to think about John having the privilege

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
as the human penman of these wonderful books of God's Word.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
As we begin to think about the book of John, the Gospel of John,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the book of 1st John, many times within those portions of Scriptures,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
you read them, you read how John deals with the subject of God's love.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You read of John dealing with that subject,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and we find that as we come to the 13th chapter,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
there's a phrase here that I've used for our title this morning,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and I hope that it would encourage you as we look at some things this morning

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
with regard to the love of God,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and we've used this phrase from John 13 and verse number 1

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
as our title this morning.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It says this in John 13 and verse number 1,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Now before the feast of the Passover,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
when Jesus knew that his hour was come,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
having loved his own which were in the world,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
notice this phrase, he loved them unto the end.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
He loved them unto the end.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The truth of John 13 and verse number 1,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that phrase, he loved them unto the end,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that's our title for the message this morning,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and this phrase carries with it not only to the very last,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
but it also carries with it the idea of loving them to the uttermost,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
of loving them completely.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
There's nothing lacking in God's love that he has for his people,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and we find here that in John 13 and verse number 1,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and before we get into the thoughts of the message this morning,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I want you to understand as John is writing this,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
again under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and following the timeline of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that at this particular time, the Bible reveals to us,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
notice in verse number 1 again, when Jesus knew that his hour was come.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
If you're not very familiar with the book of John, the gospel of John,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it's important for us to understand that this phrase about God's hour,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
his hour, is repeated throughout the gospel of John.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
You find that it begins in John chapter number 2,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
where the Bible says this was the first miracle,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and it says that his hour was not yet come.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The beginning of his earthly ministry,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that first miracle at the marriage at Cana,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and we find that John 2 reveals to us on that very first time in the gospel of John

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
with regard to this concept, this idea of the hour,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and it says his hour was not yet come.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Again, you find as you go through the page of the book of John,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
the gospel of John about the hour,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and he says in John chapter 12 and verse number 23,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
it says, and Jesus answered them saying,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the hour is come that the Son of Man shall be glorified,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and then in John 13 and verse number 1,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the Bible says when Jesus knew that his hour was come,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
notice what he knew, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
There was only one way for him to depart out of this world unto the Father,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and we understand that he came to finish the work,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and that work was the cross of Calvary.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
He would go to that cruel cross.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He would suffer, bleed, and die.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
He would be buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and he would rise conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
After his resurrection, he would make himself known for 40 days

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
before he would ascend to heaven,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
awaiting his soon return.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I'm thankful that he's there.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
He's interceding for us.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
He ever liveth to make intercession for us.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We understand that he will come again.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
He gives that promise in John chapter number 14 and verse number 1,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
down through verse number 3,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
but we find that he had this knowledge that his hour was come.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
He's preparing his disciples for his departure.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
As you study through this portion of the gospel of John,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you eventually come to chapter number 17,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
where the Bible simply declares it this way,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Father, the hour is come.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
What's he referring to?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
That hour, that time period in which he would go to the cross.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And in knowing that the hour was come,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
having loved his own which were in the world,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the Holy Spirit led the writer, John,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to write these words that he, Christ, loved them unto the end.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Completely.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
To the uttermost.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
To the very last.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm going to think about this subject of God's great love for us.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.519
in this truth here in John 13 in verse number one,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.920
that he loved them unto the end.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.360
I'm mindful of the truth this morning

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.880
that there are times in our lives

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.359
in which we can doubt the love of God.

00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:12.640
There are times in our lives

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.319
where maybe we use the wrong things

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:18.680
to try to measure God's love for us.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.840
In fact, there's a song that,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.239
I believe his brother, Mike Clark,

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:27.520
sang the song about that Jesus said, I love you.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.760
And the reality is in that song, he says this,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.400
some measure God's love by the things that they have.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.240
That's a wrong measuring unit,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.319
a unit of measuring God's love.

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:42.959
But some people are led to believe

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.439
that if things are going well,

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.200
if I have this and I have that and so on and so forth,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.959
that God must love me.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.400
We have a real hard time reading the book of Job.

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:57.279
God's love for you and God's love for me

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:00.639
is not measured by our possessions.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:04.360
It's not measured by our possession, our position.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.160
No, it's not measured by those things.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.279
God's love for us is settled because he said, I love you.

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:13.879
And he demonstrated, he showed us that great love

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:16.559
when he went to the cross of Calvary.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.639
There are times in the lives even of God's people

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:21.839
that we can go through some circumstances

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:25.360
and some situations and we can have that grief,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.680
we can have that anxiety that Dean spoke of or sang of,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.720
we can have those things that are going on in our lives

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.199
and we can wonder, does God really love me?

00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.199
Does he know where I am?

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:38.599
I feel alone, I feel, I begin to doubt.

00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:40.919
And I tell you that there is an enemy that you have

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:44.040
and one of the titles of our enemy, our adversary,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.639
the devil, is that he is the accuser of the brethren.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.680
And so in those very moments of life

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.279
and those difficult, dark times

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.760
when things seem to not be going the way

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.879
that you thought they'd go,

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:58.279
when you seem like, as the psalmist would say,

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.919
I'm all alone and what might be going on,

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:04.279
it's in those times even as you would doubt

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.519
that the enemy, the accuser of the brethren

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.959
would love to come next to you and say,

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:10.199
see, does God really love you?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.119
Does God really love you?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.119
He wants us to doubt it.

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:17.360
And I'm here to tell you this morning

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.199
that we should never doubt God's love.

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:22.639
We should never doubt the love of God.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:27.240
I've said this in messages this year a few times

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.119
and it's worth repeating that we should never

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:31.559
put a question mark where God puts a period,

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:35.039
where God has revealed truth to us,

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:39.000
where he has declared clearly his stated truth to us.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.039
We should never doubt,

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:43.679
though our circumstances may be difficult,

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:48.199
though it seems as if maybe the enemy is rising against us

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:49.679
that we must rest in knowing

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:52.080
what God has told us in his word.

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:55.240
So when we think about this subject this morning,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.080
that he loved them unto the end,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.639
and thinking about his great love for us,

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.520
let me share with you a few thoughts.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.360
Number one, I would say this

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.759
when you think about the love of God,

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:08.520
that we must remind ourselves of his love for us.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.080
Can I say to you personally this morning

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.720
that you should remind yourself that God loves you?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.720
You should remind yourself of that.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.119
You say, really, that seems kind of silly, pastor,

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:19.759
to say I should remind myself.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.919
Well, there are people in God's word

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:24.039
that remind themselves that God loved them.

00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:25.520
And I believe that it's important for us

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.960
to remind ourselves.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.679
See, we go through the difficult times,

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:30.240
we go through the challenges,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.800
that we remind ourselves that God loves me.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.279
God loves me.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.240
It might be difficult, it might be dark,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.839
it might be dreary, it might seem as if,

00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:41.279
no, but God loves me.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.479
And his love is a perfect love.

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:44.600
His love is an unconditional.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.320
We talk about all those descriptive terms,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.800
and we remind ourselves that God loves us.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.320
Let me remind you of what John says.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.639
Turn back to John.

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:53.080
You might still be there in chapter 13.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.639
Look over in verse number 23.

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.960
And we notice this throughout the book of John.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.119
I love the way that John refers to himself.

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:00.199
Again, it's under the inspiration

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:01.479
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.360
And so we know that it's not John

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.119
just coming up with this phraseology.

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.559
But I want you to see what the Bible says.

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:11.679
In John chapter number 13, in verse number 21,

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:13.520
the Bible says, when Jesus had thus said,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.960
he was troubled in spirit and testified,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.720
and said, verily, verily, I say unto you

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.640
that one of you shall betray me.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.440
This is after he'd washed their feet.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.399
In chapter number 13, it's revealed to us

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:27.640
where the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.000
washes the feet of the disciples,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.399
including him that would deny him.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.179
Him, that being Peter, of course, would deny him.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:39.880
But also you think about Judas, who would betray him.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.380
He washes their feet.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:45.920
And he reveals here in verse number 21 about the betrayal.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.079
And then the Bible says this.

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:48.839
Then the disciples looked one to another,

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:50.320
doubting of whom he spake.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.839
Now there was leaning on Jesus's bosom,

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:54.880
one of his disciples, notice what the Bible says,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.160
whom Jesus loved.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
Now that could be true of all the disciples, could it not?

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.839
Jesus loved them.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:05.239
But who's it talking about personally?

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:06.640
John.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.320
Isn't that amazing to you?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.359
It's amazing to me how John refers to himself

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:14.760
in the Gospel of John as the one whom Jesus loved.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.320
I think there's good reason for John

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.359
to refer to himself that way.

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:22.040
It's a good reminder that God loves me.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.559
Whom Jesus loved.

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:30.399
Notice over in chapter 19, in verse number 26,

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:34.839
here we find that Jesus is there on the cross of Calvary.

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:37.839
He's already gone through the trial before Caiaphas.

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.279
He stood before Pilate.

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.600
The crucifixion has begun.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.239
He's walked up the hill called Calvary.

00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:46.480
He's there upon the cross, and the Bible tells us

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.760
in verse number 25, now there stood by the cross of Jesus

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.679
his mother, his mother's sister, Mary,

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:55.600
the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600
When Jesus therefore saw his mother

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.600
and the disciples standing by whom he loved,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.359
he said unto his mother, woman, behold thy son.

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:09.040
Again, talking about John.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.160
He saw that disciple.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.160
He said, and the disciples standing by whom he loved.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.279
In chapter 20, as it's the truth of the resurrection,

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.399
Jesus has been crucified, he's been buried,

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:22.799
and the first day of the week comes,

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:24.640
and the Bible tells us in verse number one

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.720
that Mary Magdalene went early down to the tomb,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.760
and it was dark, and unto the sepulcher,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.079
and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:34.320
Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.220
and to the other disciple, notice whom Jesus loved.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:44.059
You can read it in chapter 21, in verse number seven,

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:45.299
when they're out there on the ship.

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:47.339
Remember, Peter said, I go a-fishing.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.100
And the other disciples said, we're coming with you.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.980
And Jesus appears on the ship,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.899
and he calls out in verse number five,

00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:59.779
children, have ye any meat?

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:01.660
Now the worst question that you could be asked

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.140
as a fisherman when you've caught nothing

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.660
is how's the catch?

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.739
They've caught nothing.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:15.779
Jesus, the resurrected Savior, standing there on the shore,

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:20.260
asks that question, and they reply by saying no.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.100
He then tells them to cast the net

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.059
on the right side of the ship, and you shall find

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:27.660
they obeyed, they cast, therefore,

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.980
now they were not able to draw it

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.980
for the multitude of fishes,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.459
and verse seven tells us this of John 21,

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:36.100
therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.140
saith unto Peter, it is the Lord.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.059
It is the Lord.

00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:45.459
And I'm thankful that John reminded himself.

00:17:45.459 --> 00:17:47.739
You can look at verse 20 of John chapter 21,

00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:49.339
but we'll keep moving along.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.380
We find that the Bible reveals to us in the gospel of John

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.660
where John reminds himself, he refers to himself

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.100
as the one whom Jesus loved,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.140
that disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.420
I want you to think about the apostle Paul.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.700
It was over in the book of Galatians, if you will.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.540
Galatians chapter number two.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.459
See, the apostle Paul reminded himself that God loved him.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:19.100
Paul was a man who was religious, but lost.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.739
When he first comes on the pages of Scripture,

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:22.100
his name is Saul.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.420
He's persecuting the church.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.019
He's looking for any that be of that way.

00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:29.339
We find that on a road to Damascus, he meets the Lord.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.859
It's in that place that his life is forever changed.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.619
Who art thou, Lord?

00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:37.539
And Jesus reveals himself to him and he says,

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:38.859
what wilt thou have me to do?

00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:40.900
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:18:41.979 --> 00:18:44.580
We find that his name would soon be changed to Paul

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.419
and we refer to him as Paul.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:48.260
And we look here in Galatians chapter two

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.179
and he's writing to these that he'd had the opportunity

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:54.299
to minister to during his first missionary journey.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.059
And he shares this great testimony with them

00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:57.820
in verse number 20, a verse that many of us

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.780
have memorized in our lives.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.619
When he says this, I am crucified with Christ.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.820
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:10.780
The life which I now live in the flesh,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.539
I live by the faith of the Son of God,

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:17.020
notice this, who loved me and gave himself for me.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.260
I believe that the Apostle Paul,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.500
as he would even write this, of course,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.979
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:27.820
but he's writing back to the churches

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.039
in the region of Galatia that he has this opportunity

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.000
to be able to share with them that truth,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.559
that reminder that Jesus loved me.

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:38.000
And he proved that love for me

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.760
by going to the cross of Calvary for me.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.280
We find in the book of Ephesians in the third chapter,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.919
notice what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter number three,

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.080
Paul is now writing to the believers in Ephesus

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.840
and we find that he's written to the churches

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.919
there in Galatia, the region of Galatia,

00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:57.359
and reminded them as he's even reminding himself

00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:00.039
that Jesus loved him, but now as he's writing

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:02.979
to the church in Ephesus and to these believers

00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:06.379
on two occasions in the book of Ephesians,

00:20:06.379 --> 00:20:09.259
the Apostle Paul records and reveals

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:12.299
to the believers in Ephesus how he was praying for them.

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:15.579
In chapter number three, it's the second record

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:18.379
of that prayer that the Apostle Paul would reveal.

00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:20.619
And it's interesting to me and it's noteworthy

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.299
and I believe exemplary for us to understand

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:25.619
that as Paul would say to people that I'm praying for you,

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.759
that he also said, here's how I'm praying for you.

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:29.819
It's an encouraging thing to know

00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:31.239
that somebody is praying for you,

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:32.719
but how encouraging it is to know

00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:35.599
how they're praying for you, specifically.

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:37.559
By the way, when you look at the prayers

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.079
of the Apostle Paul that are recorded

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.419
within the pages of this book,

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:45.479
we find that Paul always was praying for people

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:47.879
with regard to their spiritual well-being.

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:53.359
Notice he says this, we won't take the time

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:55.199
to look at the entirety of the prayer,

00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:57.519
but we notice that in verse number 15,

00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:59.299
he begins to pray.

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:01.619
Verse 14 says, for this cause I bow my knees

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:03.299
unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.019
He's praying for these believers.

00:21:05.019 --> 00:21:06.739
But notice where he says in verse number 18

00:21:06.739 --> 00:21:09.359
that you may be able to comprehend with all saints

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:12.099
what is the breadth and length and depth and height

00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:16.299
and to know the love of Christ,

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:18.819
which passeth knowledge that you might be filled

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:21.959
with all the fullness of God.

00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:24.259
I believe that even as the Apostle Paul

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:27.679
would pray for others to understand,

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:29.919
to know the love of Christ,

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.559
that that in of itself was a reminder for him

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:35.859
as to how much God loved him.

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:37.159
You know, when you're teaching somebody else,

00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:38.239
when you're praying for somebody else,

00:21:38.239 --> 00:21:40.639
you're also reminding yourself of the very truth

00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:43.879
that you're seeking to give.

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.619
We find here that the Apostle Paul says,

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:47.219
I want you, Church at Ephesus,

00:21:47.219 --> 00:21:52.219
I want you believers to know the love of Christ.

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:54.319
He would tell them in chapter number five

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:56.679
how that Christ demonstrated that love

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:59.319
as he would give that charge, that admonition

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:01.439
to the husbands to love your wives.

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:05.359
And he says this, even as Christ also loved the church

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:07.079
and gave himself for it.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:11.919
What a great reminder of God's great love.

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:14.439
This morning, I believe it's important

00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:17.919
that we would remind ourselves that God loves us.

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.399
Turn back to the book of John, if you will,

00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:20.919
in the 11th chapter.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:23.619
In John chapter number 11.

00:22:29.219 --> 00:22:34.019
The passage of Scripture reveals to us an event

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:37.119
in the life of those that Jesus loved.

00:22:38.379 --> 00:22:41.379
Lazarus dies in John chapter number 11.

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:47.339
Lazarus is sick to start the chapter.

00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:50.019
We find that Mary and Martha, his sisters,

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:53.119
going to send word to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:54.719
And the Bible begins in verse number one

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:57.639
and says, now a certain man was sick named Lazarus

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:01.219
of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:03.239
Was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment

00:23:03.239 --> 00:23:04.699
and wiped his feet with her hair,

00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:06.559
whose brother Lazarus was sick?

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:09.359
Notice verse number three,

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:12.499
therefore his sister sent unto him, saying, Lord.

00:23:12.499 --> 00:23:15.299
I want you to understand, they sent to Jesus this message

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:18.779
because they understood some things about Jesus.

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:20.119
One thing that's revealed to us,

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:21.719
we'll read in just a moment in verse number three,

00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:23.099
but I also believe that they understood

00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:25.159
that Jesus could do something about it.

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:31.059
They didn't believe that, they wouldn't have sent for Jesus.

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:33.499
They sent for Jesus and notice the Bible says,

00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:38.499
behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:41.039
Isn't that interesting to you?

00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:44.919
They could have said Lazarus is sick.

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:48.899
But the messengers are given this message

00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:53.899
to deliver to Jesus, he whom thou lovest is sick.

00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:58.199
Now, did Jesus need a reminder that he loved Lazarus?

00:23:58.199 --> 00:23:59.039
No.

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:02.679
You think Mary and Martha might have needed a reminder

00:24:03.639 --> 00:24:05.699
that Lazarus was loved by God?

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:11.339
When he was sick, the circumstances seemed dim.

00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:15.939
Maybe the doctors have, the text doesn't tell us,

00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:17.239
it's an assumption.

00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:21.139
But I understand as I would think about our own lives

00:24:21.139 --> 00:24:23.419
and I think about the circumstances that we deal with,

00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:25.619
and we could hear news and we could understand

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:27.819
and maybe just even from our own perspective,

00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:30.479
there are times in which you've seen some people, no doubt,

00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:31.779
where you look at their condition,

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:33.919
you look at their health, you look at some injury

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:36.119
and you say, oh, that's no big deal, you'll be fine.

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:38.619
But other times you say, that's a serious matter.

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:44.619
We find that the Bible says, he whom thou lovest is sick.

00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:47.479
When Jesus heard that, he said,

00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:51.219
this sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God,

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:54.219
that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:56.419
Then the Bible tells us this, John writing again

00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:57.899
with the inspirational Holy Spirit of God,

00:24:57.899 --> 00:25:02.899
now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:05.999
I believe that God's love for them was obvious,

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:10.599
they knew it, they were aware of God's love

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:12.079
for them personally.

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:14.599
We can read of the times, the interactions personally

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:15.799
as you study through the Gospels

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.279
that they had one with another

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.139
and we understand that it was obvious to them,

00:25:19.139 --> 00:25:20.679
it was known by them.

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:23.439
They're able to say, he whom thou lovest is sick.

00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:26.119
But I want you to understand that not only was it known

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:28.979
or obvious to them, but it was known even by others

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:32.079
as Jesus would stand at that tomb and he would weep.

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:34.439
The Bible says that the Jews that were gathered there

00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:39.359
in verse number 36 said, behold, how he loved him.

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:41.199
How he loved him.

00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:46.079
This morning, as we begin to think about God's great love

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:48.599
for us and begin to think about the truth

00:25:49.639 --> 00:25:52.279
that he loved them unto the end,

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:55.399
that we understand that God loves us.

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.399
This morning, there may be some times in your life

00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:03.399
that you're prone to drift and wander in doubt.

00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:06.199
Maybe you're going through a difficult time.

00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:08.039
And in the midst of that difficulty,

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:11.119
the accuser of the brethren comes

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:13.419
and begins to whisper some things in your ear.

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.799
You can begin to doubt the love of God.

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:21.739
I would tell you this morning that we must remind ourselves,

00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:26.739
regularly remind ourselves, God loves me, God loves me.

00:26:29.199 --> 00:26:32.219
The little song that we sing in Sunday school,

00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:37.219
Jesus loves me, this I know.

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:44.379
For the Bible tells me so, right?

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:49.099
It doesn't say Jesus loves me, this I know,

00:26:49.099 --> 00:26:51.419
because everything's going well and I have all of these.

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:53.779
No, no, no, the Bible tells me so.

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:58.619
I remind myself that God loves me.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:01.539
Number two this morning, I would say this,

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:06.139
rest in his love for you, rest in his love.

00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:08.979
Sometimes we get so anxious about things in life.

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:12.379
Sometimes we're just overwhelmed.

00:27:12.379 --> 00:27:14.259
The psalmist says when I'm overwhelmed,

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:15.819
and you can read through the Psalms,

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:18.219
you can read many times when the psalmist is overwhelmed

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.579
and he's transparent, and the problem sometimes

00:27:20.579 --> 00:27:23.139
that we have in our own lives is we fail

00:27:23.139 --> 00:27:25.119
on that part of transparency.

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:27.179
We can pretend and put up this facade

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:28.659
like we got everything together,

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:31.619
but we're really breaking inside and we're overwhelmed

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:34.139
and we have anxiety and grief and whatever,

00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:37.499
and we must simply learn to rest in his love.

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:43.499
See, when we have reminded ourselves that God loves us,

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:46.179
that enables us to rest in his love.

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:48.539
Because when I understand that God loves me,

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.299
when I've reminded myself, I can rest in it

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:54.019
knowing that he has my best interest in mind,

00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:56.439
that he always does that which is right.

00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:58.239
Listen, God never makes a mistake.

00:27:58.239 --> 00:27:59.879
Nothing ever surprises him.

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:01.719
He's never taken off guard.

00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:06.719
He loves me and he loves you, and I must rest in that.

00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:08.539
I must rest in that.

00:28:08.539 --> 00:28:11.359
Listen, we understand what it is to love one another.

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:12.199
Do we not?

00:28:12.199 --> 00:28:13.199
We have children, we love our children.

00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:15.959
We have spouses, we love our spouse.

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:19.179
We understand what it is to love one another.

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:24.359
God's love is so much greater than our love.

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:28.839
If you love your children,

00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:30.599
you want them to know that you love them.

00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:32.959
You want them to be able to rest in that love.

00:28:32.959 --> 00:28:35.039
You don't want them running around day by day

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:37.639
scratching their head wondering, does daddy love me?

00:28:37.639 --> 00:28:39.259
Does mommy love me?

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:41.079
No, you want them to rest in that.

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:43.239
You want them to be assured of that.

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:45.199
You want them to know that they can come to you

00:28:45.199 --> 00:28:48.279
and that they know that you love them.

00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:53.000
Your spouse, listen, a spouse should never have to doubt

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.659
whether their spouse loves them.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.739
They should be able to rest in that.

00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:02.679
They should have that great peace of knowing

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:04.359
that my spouse loves me.

00:29:07.719 --> 00:29:10.559
Just turn to the book of Romans, if you will.

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:12.559
In Romans chapter number eight,

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:17.559
great picture, I believe, of resting in God's love for us.

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:24.399
I've reminded myself that God loves me.

00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:26.440
You see, the storm is raging.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.320
The difficulties are real.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.320
The anxiety level is high, but God loves me.

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:36.959
But God loves me, and I'm gonna rest in that.

00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:40.259
See, when I understand all of who God is,

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:44.380
and all of his great power, and his wisdom, and his plan,

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:46.899
it enables me to rest.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:50.839
We find in Romans chapter number eight in verse number 31,

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:54.000
the Bible says, what shall we then say to these things?

00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:58.139
If God be for us, who can be against us?

00:29:58.139 --> 00:30:02.439
He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all,

00:30:02.439 --> 00:30:07.639
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:12.639
Aren't you thankful for his love, as it's even referred to in verse number 32,

00:30:12.639 --> 00:30:14.639
though you do not see the word love,

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:17.639
but when you read about the fact that he delivered him up for us all,

00:30:17.639 --> 00:30:21.139
speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ, that's the truth of John 3, 16,

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:25.139
for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:27.639
We find in verse number 33, notice what the Bible says,

00:30:27.639 --> 00:30:30.139
who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:33.639
It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:37.639
It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again,

00:30:37.639 --> 00:30:41.639
who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:48.639
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

00:30:48.639 --> 00:30:58.139
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:06.139
or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:10.139
As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long,

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:15.139
we are counted as sheep for the slaughter, nay, in all these things.

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:22.639
We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

00:31:22.639 --> 00:31:24.639
For I am persuaded.

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:32.639
I'm thankful for that word, that phrase that Paul uses.

00:31:32.639 --> 00:31:39.639
He says that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:44.139
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:49.139
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature

00:31:49.139 --> 00:31:53.139
shall be able to separate us from the love of God,

00:31:53.139 --> 00:31:58.139
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:31:58.139 --> 00:32:02.139
That's a recipe for resting in God's love right there.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:04.139
Honestly.

00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:06.139
You say, but pastor, this thing's going on.

00:32:06.139 --> 00:32:09.139
Read it again.

00:32:09.139 --> 00:32:12.639
I love the fact, obviously it's God's word,

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.639
and all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:32:14.639 --> 00:32:17.639
but he goes through all these things that are not going to be able to separate us,

00:32:17.639 --> 00:32:20.639
but then just in case somebody would come along and try to fit something in,

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.639
he says, nor any other creature.

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:27.639
Listen, there's nothing that's going to separate you from the love of God.

00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:30.639
And we rest in it.

00:32:30.639 --> 00:32:32.639
Listen, you understand this morning,

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:35.639
I was thinking about this this morning as I was just meditating on the message

00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:40.139
that I'd be preaching today and thinking about and reminding myself of his great love for us.

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:44.139
You know, the very truth I was reading in the book of Proverbs

00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:46.139
and then also over the book of Hebrews,

00:32:46.139 --> 00:32:50.139
and the very truth for us to understand this morning is that the reason,

00:32:50.139 --> 00:32:53.139
listen, when God corrects us,

00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:56.139
we talk about chastisement in the life of a believer,

00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:59.139
you know that that's because he loves us.

00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:05.139
Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, he correcteth.

00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:08.639
And so we understand this morning

00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:11.639
that as all these things are going on in our lives

00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:14.639
and all of this turmoil that we can be faced with,

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:18.639
that we remind ourselves that God loves me personally,

00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:23.639
but then I make that decision that I'm going to rest in his love for me.

00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:26.639
It's a settled truth.

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:29.639
There's not going to be any doubt of God's love.

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:33.639
Because God's love is not based on your circumstances or on my circumstances,

00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:40.139
just as it's true when we say the statement that God is good.

00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:43.139
He's good.

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:45.139
All the time.

00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:50.139
Ms. Gloria Long, she's not able to attend here regularly anymore.

00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:53.139
I believe she watches on livestream regularly.

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:57.139
She sends a note to me every month, sends a little greeting card.

00:33:57.139 --> 00:34:00.139
Let me know how she's doing. I talk to her on the phone occasionally.

00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:05.139
But here's what she says in almost every correspondence I have with her,

00:34:05.139 --> 00:34:08.139
whether it's on the phone or on a card.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:14.139
She says this, God is good all the time.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:20.139
And it's in correspondence, all is always capitalized and underlined.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.139
God is good all the time.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:29.139
And I often say this, and all the time, God is good.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.139
Even if it's a verbal correspondence.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:36.139
God's goodness is not based on your circumstances.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.139
God is good. He's a good God.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.139
And we know, John 8 and verse number 28, the same chapter that we're looking in,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.139
the verses that precede what we just looked at,

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.139
and we know that all things work together for what?

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.139
For good!

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.139
To them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:35:00.139
And you say, I have no idea how all of this mess is going to turn out for good.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:02.139
Can I just encourage you to read this book?

00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:06.139
Because there's a whole lot of things in this book that are a mess,

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:10.139
that God turns into good.

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:12.139
God is good.

00:35:12.139 --> 00:35:16.139
And we must rest in His love.

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:18.139
This is going on, that's going on.

00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:20.139
Did you read this? Did you hear about that?

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:23.139
Did you see this? Did you...

00:35:23.139 --> 00:35:25.139
God loves me.

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:28.139
And I'm going to rest in His love.

00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:31.139
It's a decision that you have to make.

00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:33.139
It's a decision that you have to make.

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:36.139
You have to remind yourself, and then you have to rest.

00:35:36.139 --> 00:35:38.139
You have to rest.

00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:41.139
I would say this, finally, this morning, very quickly.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.139
We ought to rejoice for His great love.

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:50.139
We ought to have overwhelming joy to know that God loves us.

00:35:50.139 --> 00:35:54.139
To know the details that God has given to us in His Word

00:35:54.139 --> 00:35:56.139
with regard to how He has loved us,

00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:58.139
and how He's described that love for us.

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.139
And the reminder, man, it ought to cause us to rejoice greatly.

00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:05.139
Think about what John says in the book of 1 John, in chapter 3.

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:09.139
I believe even as he's writing here to these believers

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:12.139
that are being addressed in the book of 1 John,

00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:15.139
that it's also a period of time of rejoicing,

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:18.139
even the life of John as he's penning these words.

00:36:18.139 --> 00:36:21.139
And I think about these men that God would use

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:23.139
to pen the words of Scripture

00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:25.139
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:27.139
And I think about as they're penning these words

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:30.139
how God is working and moving and reminding,

00:36:30.139 --> 00:36:32.139
and how there's a period of rejoicing.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.139
But we find that John begins again

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:36.139
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:36:36.139 --> 00:36:40.139
The chapter divisions and verses have been added for our benefit.

00:36:40.139 --> 00:36:43.139
But in our Bibles, in John 3, in verse number 1

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:45.139
of the book of 1 John, it says,

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.139
Notice when he says,

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:58.139
Why does he say us? Because he's writing to believers.

00:36:58.139 --> 00:37:01.139
The book of 1 John is a book that's written to believers.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:04.139
And he's saying, listen, what manner of love

00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:06.139
the Father hath bestowed upon us.

00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:08.139
He's including himself.

00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:11.139
That idea of that word manner is really the sort of

00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:14.139
or the quality of the type of love.

00:37:14.139 --> 00:37:18.139
What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.

00:37:18.139 --> 00:37:20.139
Notice what it says,

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.139
It's absolutely amazing.

00:37:27.139 --> 00:37:30.139
It's reason to rejoice that God's love.

00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:32.139
What manner of love.

00:37:32.139 --> 00:37:33.139
It says,

00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:40.139
In 1 John chapter number 4, notice he says it this way

00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:42.139
in verses 7 through 10 again.

00:37:42.139 --> 00:37:44.139
This period of rejoicing, if you will,

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:47.139
with regard to knowing the love of God.

00:37:57.139 --> 00:38:01.139
And this was manifested, the love of God toward us.

00:38:01.139 --> 00:38:05.139
Because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world

00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:07.139
that we might live through him.

00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:09.139
Here in his love.

00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:11.139
Not that we love God.

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:13.139
But that he loved us.

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:18.139
And sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:20.139
Listen, if that doesn't cause you to rejoice,

00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:22.139
I don't know what will.

00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:23.139
Honestly.

00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:26.139
I don't know what would cause you to rejoice

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:28.139
if that doesn't.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.139
See, we think sometimes about this idea of rejoicing

00:38:31.139 --> 00:38:33.139
and we can read of people, we can read articles

00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:36.139
and we can see videos of people that seem to have

00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:39.139
this great level of excitement and joy

00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:43.139
with regard to some great spoil that they've received,

00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:46.139
some great windfall of good luck, quote unquote,

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:49.139
that they've been able to encounter and so on and so forth.

00:38:49.139 --> 00:38:52.139
But I want you to think about the word of God

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:55.139
and how often throughout the pages of scripture,

00:38:55.139 --> 00:38:58.139
the psalmist in particular, he speaks about having

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:01.139
gladness and joy, not in those things,

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:04.139
but in knowing who God is.

00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:06.139
And he says this, I was just reading this

00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:08.139
just the other day, in Psalm 4 and verse number 7,

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:10.139
thou hast put gladness in my heart

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:13.139
more than in the time that their corn

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:16.139
and their wine increased.

00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:19.139
Listen, they had this gladness when they had that

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:23.139
good crop and that good fortune, if you will.

00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:27.139
But God's put gladness in my heart that exceeds that.

00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:30.139
What great imagery that we see.

00:39:30.139 --> 00:39:34.139
Read in the book of Psalms, Psalm 119.

00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:37.139
The longest chapter in all of the Bible.

00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:39.139
You read about how the psalmist, he finds truth,

00:39:39.139 --> 00:39:44.139
and he says I rejoice, even as those that find great spoil.

00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:46.139
They find this great spoil and there's reason

00:39:46.139 --> 00:39:48.139
for them to have joy and to rejoice.

00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:52.139
But no, we're rejoicing because God loves me.

00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:55.139
Because God loves me.

00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:58.139
Herein is love.

00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:06.579
Not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for

00:40:06.579 --> 00:40:07.579
our sins.

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:11.659
You know our greatest need is to have a Savior.

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:16.539
The greatest need of mankind is a Savior.

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.899
The greatest need of mankind is not more money.

00:40:19.899 --> 00:40:22.139
People think that.

00:40:22.139 --> 00:40:25.899
People promise that.

00:40:25.899 --> 00:40:27.379
They do.

00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:34.379
You do this, we'll give you this, you'll be better off, so on and so forth.

00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:37.699
The greatest need is not money.

00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:45.739
The greatest need of humankind is salvation, the Savior, and God met that need.

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:48.859
The greatest need is not education.

00:40:48.859 --> 00:40:50.739
We could just keep going down the list.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:55.299
The greatest need is salvation.

00:40:55.299 --> 00:41:00.459
I believe this morning as I look at this message, and I'm not saying this because I developed

00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:05.539
the message, but I believe this morning God gave me, He taught me a truth as I was preparing

00:41:05.539 --> 00:41:09.579
this message, and it's this.

00:41:09.579 --> 00:41:12.659
There's really a cycle in this message.

00:41:12.659 --> 00:41:17.299
As I'm rejoicing in God's love for me, guess what I'm doing?

00:41:17.299 --> 00:41:24.699
I'm reminding myself that God loves me because I'm rejoicing in it, and as I'm rejoicing

00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:29.539
in it, I'm reminding myself that God loves me, and as I'm reminding myself that God loves

00:41:29.539 --> 00:41:30.859
me, you know what I'm doing?

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:34.079
I'm resting in God's love.

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:41.079
As I'm resting in God's love, I'm rejoicing that God loves me.

00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:49.439
When I'm rejoicing that God loves me, I'm reminding myself that God loves me, and I'm

00:41:49.439 --> 00:41:58.839
resting in the fact that God loves me, and it's a cycle, and it's a good cycle, and

00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:05.519
this morning, I'm so glad, as the songwriter said, I'm so glad that Jesus loves me.

00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:07.719
Jesus loves even me.

00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:10.719
Oh, wonderful things in the Bible I see.

00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:17.199
There's some amazing truth that God gives us in his word, but this is the dearest, that

00:42:17.199 --> 00:42:19.359
Jesus loves me.

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:27.439
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, and when I remind myself, when you remind yourself, you begin

00:42:27.439 --> 00:42:37.439
to rest in his love, you rejoice because he loves you, and it just is a cycle.

00:42:37.439 --> 00:42:45.519
We go through life never doubting God's love for us, never being overwhelmed with the grief,

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:53.159
the anxiety, the pressures, the troubles, because God loves me, and God knows what's

00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:54.159
best.

00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:55.719
Do you believe that this morning?

00:42:55.719 --> 00:42:56.719
I believe that.

00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:57.719
God knows what's best.

00:42:57.719 --> 00:43:03.239
I believe that God has a plan, and we always see that God's plan is better than your plan

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:04.239
or my plan.

00:43:04.239 --> 00:43:07.599
You say, well, if I was planning this, I'd do this different.

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.399
Yup, and it would fail.

00:43:10.399 --> 00:43:14.439
Let God be God and rest in his love.

00:43:14.439 --> 00:43:15.439
Let's pray together.

00:43:15.439 --> 00:43:17.679
Father, we love you.

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:22.939
We thank you for loving us.

00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:30.559
This revealed truth is a familiar truth.

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:32.399
We sing often about your love.

00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:41.959
In fact, we started our service this morning singing a song about your great love.

00:43:41.959 --> 00:43:44.759
Lord I pray that you'd help your people this morning.

00:43:44.759 --> 00:43:51.759
God, you know the needs that are represented in this room, those that are tuned in via

00:43:51.759 --> 00:43:53.679
live stream.

00:43:53.679 --> 00:44:01.959
Lord, perhaps there are some that have been overwhelmed, that have that anxiety that Dean

00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:11.879
sang about, facing difficulties and troubles and just overwhelmed.

00:44:11.999 --> 00:44:17.759
Maybe because of some of those circumstances, they've even begun to doubt your love.

00:44:17.759 --> 00:44:21.999
The adversary is working overtime, the accuser, the brethren.

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:30.959
God, I pray that in this moment, in this day, we would determine, we're going to remind

00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:38.079
ourselves regularly that you love us.

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:47.119
Like the Apostle John, maybe we'd begin referring to ourselves the one that Jesus loves, that

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.759
we'd learn to rest in your love.

00:44:48.759 --> 00:44:51.839
It's a decision that we must make.

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:58.919
God help us to rejoice.

00:44:58.919 --> 00:45:01.319
Though we're sinners, you love us.

00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:03.719
We don't deserve it.

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:07.839
You love us with an amazing love.

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:11.439
God, I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives this morning.

00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:16.959
If there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never been saved, they've never trusted

00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:22.279
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, they do not have 100% confidence that heaven

00:45:22.279 --> 00:45:23.279
is their home.

00:45:23.279 --> 00:45:26.479
God, I pray that you'd work in their heart this morning.

00:45:26.479 --> 00:45:30.279
Help them to know that you love them and you died for them so they could be saved.

00:45:30.279 --> 00:45:36.199
Their greatest need in this hour is salvation, all that they would trust Christ as their

00:45:36.199 --> 00:45:37.199
Savior today.

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:40.519
Would you move and work as only you can, have your will and way.

00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:43.319
Well, thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:44.319
Would you stand with me?

00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.319
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:50.039
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, we'll give you an opportunity

00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:51.039
to respond.

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:53.559
Maybe you want to make your seat an altar, maybe you want to come to this old-fashioned

00:45:53.559 --> 00:45:54.559
altar this morning.

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:56.759
Maybe you just want to come and thank God for His love.

00:45:56.759 --> 00:45:59.279
Maybe you've been struggling with some things.

00:45:59.279 --> 00:46:01.639
Just remind yourself that God loves you.

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:03.399
Rejoice in His love.

00:46:03.399 --> 00:46:04.959
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
