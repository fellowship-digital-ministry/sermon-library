1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,559
and we'll continue here in verse number 14.

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,199
I love the instruction given to the church at Thessalonica

3
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:08,920
at the conclusion of each letter.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,939
We've mentioned this several times now,

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,319
but at the end of 1 Thessalonians in chapter number five,

6
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,479
beginning in verse number 12,

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,799
down through the end of the chapter,

8
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,940
and then again in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,799
both letters that are written to the believers

10
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:24,920
at Thessalonica, this church that's a model church,

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,799
a good church, a church that was serving the Lord,

12
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,559
a church that was loving the brethren,

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,600
a church that was sending forth the gospel.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,479
I mean, a good church,

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,959
but they're given these words of instruction,

16
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,139
and I love the instruction.

17
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:44,099
It's concise, but it's also very applicable,

18
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,779
and we understand that these truths

19
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,919
need to be incorporated into our lives.

20
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,040
We've said often that the word of God is profitable,

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,880
and we understand this evening,

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,479
and as we've studied here for a number of weeks now

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,220
this portion of scripture,

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,259
that as we look at these portions

25
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,819
and these commands, if you will,

26
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,040
that it's very applicable.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,500
I mean, it's straightforward, and we take the truth,

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,739
and we incorporate that truth in our lives

29
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,099
so that we might have the opportunity to walk worthy

30
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,500
and to please the Lord.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,319
Tonight, we'll be looking at really the third command

32
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,019
in verse number 14.

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:21,220
It says this, I'll read the entire verse.

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,180
It says, now we exhort you, brethren,

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,360
warn them that are unruly,

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,199
comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,

37
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,319
be patient toward all men.

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,120
And so the last couple of weeks,

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,239
we've looked at this verse of scripture,

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,800
and the Lord knows all things.

41
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Aren't you thankful that God knows everything?

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,959
And he knows all things.

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,319
He has all wisdom.

44
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,080
He is outside of time, and so he knows everything,

45
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,879
and he's given us a Bible that contains instruction

46
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,879
that is really, it's relevant for every era of human history.

47
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,040
Why?

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,319
Because it's written by the eternal God.

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,160
There are some that say,

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,319
well, the Bible's not relevant anymore.

51
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,019
No, it is relevant because it was written by God.

52
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,440
All scripture is given by inspiration of God

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,880
and is profitable, and so the Bible is relevant,

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
and God, who knows all things,

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,639
he knew that there would be some that would be unruly.

56
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,320
And those folks, he says, they need to be warned.

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,679
He knew that there would some that would be feeble-minded.

58
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:27,600
They would be weak and dealing with the little of spirit,

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,839
if you will, easily discouraged,

60
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:32,919
and he said that those folks, they need to be comforted,

61
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,320
and we dealt with that last week

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,360
and talked about how that encouragement,

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,960
that word comfort, literally has the idea

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,000
of speaking with someone in close proximity

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,119
and how you come close to someone

66
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:48,179
and you try to encourage them and speak those words to them,

67
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,399
point them to Jesus, and what a great truth.

68
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,240
This evening, as we look here

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,720
and we see the third command in this verse of scripture,

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,039
that we are to support the weak,

71
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,139
and so God knew that there would be some that would be weak

72
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,279
and they would need to be supported.

73
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:09,119
I believe that a church is a family, amen?

74
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:13,039
And often we refer to our church as a church family.

75
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,119
We use the terminology of speaking

76
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,720
of brothers and sisters in Christ,

77
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,039
and we understand that as we have been born again,

78
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,679
as we've been adopted in the family of God,

79
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,800
and we are family, and it's exciting,

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,160
and it's appropriate, it's God-ordained

81
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,360
that a church family acts as a family,

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,559
and as there will be times in which

83
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,039
there are some within the family who are weak,

84
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,520
that they need to be supported.

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,000
And so we find that the instruction is support the weak.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,240
I've just titled the lesson that tonight, Support the Weak,

87
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,559
and let me answer a couple of questions

88
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,080
as we go through it this evening.

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,919
I'm kinda gonna teach through it by asking questions.

90
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,000
The first one is this, who are the weak?

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Who are the weak?

92
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Well, really, as I said last week,

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,679
I said that you may encourage today

94
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,160
and you may need encouragement tomorrow.

95
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
I ended the service last Wednesday evening

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,160
with that statement, and the reality this evening

97
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,000
is that there could be any of us

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
at any given time that could be weak.

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,079
And when we talk about being weak,

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,040
I believe really there are two categories

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
in which we can look to,

102
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,880
and one of them would be physically.

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,720
We could speak about being physically weak.

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,040
Some are weak physically, and I don't think

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,119
that's the main emphasis of this verse of Scripture,

106
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,679
though there is application with regard

107
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,399
to those that are physically weak.

108
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,959
Maybe some are weak physically as a result of age.

109
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,600
Each of us have understood, and I still am relatively young.

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,399
I like to think of myself as a young man,

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,480
but the reality is that as we grow older,

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,119
we do find ourselves, even in my mid-40s,

113
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,880
I find myself not having the strength

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,679
that I did when I was 18.

115
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,040
And some of you say, wait until you're 60,

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,200
or 70, or fill in the blank, and I understand,

117
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,920
but what I'm saying is that each of us

118
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,880
can acknowledge in our lives, wherever we are,

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,600
that physical weakness can happen

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,320
really just as a result of age.

121
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,519
You can read Ecclesiastes, and you can read

122
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,279
how that all of those members, they begin to fail,

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,600
and that's just what happens.

124
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,519
Our bodies begin to break down,

125
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,359
and so there are some that are weak physically

126
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,320
that's simply a result of age,

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,279
but we find that there are some that are weak physically

128
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,920
that perhaps might be a result

129
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,920
of some type of physical condition, a medical condition,

130
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,359
some physical ailment.

131
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:41,399
I think about times when you think about the Apostle Paul

132
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,880
who God would use to pen these words of instruction.

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
There were times in which he faced great persecution,

134
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,799
and physically, outwardly, he was weak.

135
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,559
And there was some times in which there were some brothers

136
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:59,359
and some church families and some sisters in Christ

137
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,760
that came and supported him through those times

138
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,119
of great persecution in his life,

139
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,839
and so we find that there's definitely an aspect

140
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,200
when we consider the thought of support the weak,

141
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,279
but there could be some that are physically weak

142
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,480
that need some support.

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
I think about this,

144
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,359
not only who are the weak speaking of physically,

145
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,679
but think about this of those that are weak spiritually,

146
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,399
those who are weak spiritually.

147
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,440
Now, some are weak spiritually

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,040
simply because they're babes in Christ.

149
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,279
You know, each and every one of us at one point

150
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,480
in our spiritual lives, we were a babe in Christ.

151
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,679
When you got saved, when you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

152
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,760
as your personal Savior, you were a babe in Christ,

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,839
and we find that as a babe in Christ,

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
and I try at times in my life

155
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
to look back at my spiritual journey,

156
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,679
and I shared with someone yesterday,

157
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,799
I was giving a gospel tract,

158
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,119
and I mentioned how the truth in that tract

159
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,160
changed my life over 25 years ago,

160
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
and I encouraged them to read it,

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,559
and I asked them to give me a commitment

162
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,119
that they would read the gospel tract.

163
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,519
I did not have opportunity to speak with them

164
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,640
at any type of length of time,

165
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,920
but simply to share that simple thought and that challenge,

166
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,660
and they said, I will read it, and I hope that they will,

167
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,940
but the reality is that I do not,

168
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,980
when I look back at my spiritual journey,

169
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,380
when I look back at my life as a believer,

170
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,820
I was weak when I first got saved.

171
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,700
I was a babe.

172
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,459
I didn't know a whole lot of things, and neither did you.

173
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,420
I'm gonna think about, obviously,

174
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,700
with having Evan and Juliana and Nova around recently

175
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,260
and thinking about being a babe physically

176
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,220
and thinking about Nova as a baby,

177
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,579
and you can make some spiritual application

178
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,899
with regard to even as God does in his word,

179
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,619
as newborn babes desire that's the seer milk of the word,

180
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:48,059
why, that ye may grow thereby,

181
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:50,540
and so we find that there is a need

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,480
for those babes in Christ to be supported.

183
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,140
We don't look at a babe in Christ

184
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,940
and kind of look down our nose,

185
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,059
I can't believe they don't know that.

186
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,359
Hold on a minute.

187
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,899
We didn't know it either if someone didn't take some time

188
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,100
to invest in us and teach us and support us, amen,

189
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,859
and sometimes, if we're not careful,

190
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,899
as we would grow mature in the Lord,

191
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,660
as we would understand some things,

192
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,019
we could, if we're not careful,

193
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,220
look at some that are babes in Christ

194
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,959
and wonder why do they do what they do?

195
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,140
Well, maybe they just haven't been taught,

196
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,779
and we need to be aware of that.

197
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,019
Some are weak spiritually

198
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,520
simply because they're babes in Christ.

199
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,219
Some, however, are weak spiritually

200
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,140
because they've just not grown like they should.

201
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,719
That's a totally different category.

202
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,820
In fact, Paul deals with that.

203
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,619
I believe that he's the human penman

204
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:45,840
for the book of Hebrews,

205
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,940
and he deals with that with strong language.

206
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,659
In the time that you ought to be teachers,

207
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,020
you have need that one teach you,

208
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,940
and at the end of chapter number five,

209
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,539
he deals with that in Hebrews,

210
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,619
and the reality is that Paul is saying to those believers,

211
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,799
listen, you've been saved for a long time,

212
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,380
and you're not where you ought to be.

213
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,940
You need to grow.

214
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,539
There's, and you think about the church in Corinth.

215
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,299
We know that Paul wrote the book

216
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,780
of First and Second Corinthians humanly speaking,

217
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,979
and as he's ministering to those people in Corinth,

218
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:17,020
he says I can't speak to you as spiritual,

219
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,419
but as carnal, why?

220
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:20,500
Because you're babes in Christ.

221
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
You're just carnal, and I can't,

222
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,659
there's so many things I want to tell you, but I can't,

223
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,700
and so we find there's a category of folks

224
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
that might be weak spiritually

225
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,859
because they've just not grown like they should.

226
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,559
Maybe they've not gotten plugged in.

227
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,700
Maybe they've not gotten involved

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,380
at some level of discipleship,

229
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,140
and faithful attendance to church.

230
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,780
You know, the reality is that you cannot make someone grow.

231
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,059
You just can't do it.

232
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,140
I can't make decisions for you.

233
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
You can't make decisions for someone else.

234
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,940
All you can do is give them truth,

235
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,619
and you can give them the opportunities to be able to grow,

236
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:57,219
but the reality is that there's some desire

237
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,380
on their part that is necessary,

238
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,780
and then they need to grow.

239
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,340
to apply those things in their lives.

240
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,620
Perhaps, as we think about those that are weak spiritually,

241
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,180
perhaps there's a third category

242
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,920
that we should consider this evening.

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,960
There are some that have experienced great persecution

244
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,760
and are weak spiritually as a result.

245
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,360
It's just kind of really shaken them.

246
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,460
I think about the believers that Paul is writing to

247
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,860
in the book of 1 Thessalonians,

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,940
and I consider what they've dealt with,

249
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,440
and we've addressed it in several of our messages,

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,100
but in chapter number three,

251
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,040
we find that Paul specifically mentions the afflictions

252
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,500
that they were dealing with,

253
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
and he says about those afflictions,

254
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
he talks about the tempter tempting them,

255
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,740
and we know that that would be Satan,

256
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,820
and those afflictions that they're dealing with,

257
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,940
and he says that he was concerned

258
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,020
that it would move them in the sense

259
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,280
that they would no longer be doing

260
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,820
the things that they ought to be doing.

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,020
Notice how he says it.

262
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,120
In 1 Thessalonians 3, in verse number five,

263
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,660
he says, for this cause, when I could no longer forbear,

264
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I sent to know your faith.

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,420
I wanted to know why, lest by some means

266
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,420
the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.

267
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,940
I mean, that's the terminology that is used.

268
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,640
I think about the believers in the churches

269
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,380
in the region of Galatia.

270
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,500
We find that during the first missionary journey,

271
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,700
the apostle Paul was used of the Lord

272
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,660
to start these churches in the region of Galatia,

273
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,160
and we find that as Paul is writing to these believers,

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,060
there's some spiritual battle that has taken place

275
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,480
in the region of Galatia.

276
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,300
To understand the context, there were false teachers

277
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,020
that came into the region, Judaizers, they were coming in.

278
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
In fact, they were saying, we can read it in Acts 15,

279
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,360
and we can understand exactly what they were saying,

280
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,620
that unless you're circumcised after the manner of Moses,

281
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
you cannot be saved.

282
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,300
Now, that's completely contradictory to the message

283
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,140
that was preached by the apostle Paul,

284
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,100
and there was a great discussion that took place,

285
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,220
a council at the church at Jerusalem to address that,

286
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,080
but there were people that were affected

287
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,040
by this false teaching, by these levels of persecution

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,300
that they were dealing with in the false teaching,

289
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,120
and Paul says this to them in Galatians 5,

290
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,120
in verse number seven, he says, ye did run well.

291
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,360
Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?

292
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,340
They were weak spiritually because of some

293
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,380
of the opposition that they were dealing with,

294
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,840
and some of the false teaching that was invading

295
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,960
the churches there in the region of Galatia,

296
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,600
and so we find that there's really a couple of categories,

297
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
I believe, that we look at this verse of Scripture

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,560
in 1 Thessalonians 5, in verse 14,

299
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
there's a couple of categories of those that are weak,

300
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,380
physically and spiritually, but there are a number

301
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,440
of reasons why someone might be weak physically,

302
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,220
there are a number of reasons why someone

303
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,700
might be weak spiritually.

304
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,980
So we seek to answer the question, who are the weak?

305
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,080
We wanna be able to identify, if the Bible tells us

306
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,620
if the instruction, the exhortation, is to support

307
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,380
the weak, we need to be able to know who the weak are,

308
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,180
being able to identify them so that we can fulfill

309
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,240
the instruction that is being given to do what?

310
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,980
Well, to support them.

311
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,580
We find that really, what we're to do,

312
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,940
if you think about the second thought this evening,

313
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,100
who are the weak, but then number two,

314
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,400
what do we do for the weak?

315
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,620
Well, it says to support them, to care for them,

316
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,460
to hold them up, I think about a building,

317
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,500
a structure, and you think about a support system.

318
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,040
You think about the importance of building a structure,

319
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,580
obviously foundation is important, but there are,

320
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,540
sometimes we'll use this term of a wall

321
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,140
that is a weight-bearing, a load-bearing wall.

322
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,780
Now what happens if you take that wall out?

323
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,580
You got a problem, right?

324
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,500
You decide, hey, we're gonna do some renovations,

325
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,940
you just start tearing down walls without finding out

326
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,820
which one is load-bearing, you might have a real problem

327
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,980
on your hands.

328
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,180
There's a big pole downstairs in the junior church room,

329
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,460
it's actually almost, it's a little bit,

330
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,780
maybe right where that first pew is,

331
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,660
somewhere in that area, there's a pole down there

332
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,020
that's right in the middle of the room.

333
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,780
We've actually had a couple of people run right into it,

334
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,980
I don't know what they were looking at

335
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,860
or what they were doing, but it just kinda in the way,

336
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
and you look at that thing and say,

337
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,380
man, that's in a bad spot.

338
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,420
Yeah, but it's holding us up.

339
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,980
You can't just remove it, right?

340
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,660
You can't remove that because that is supporting this.

341
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,580
And then there are a series of them,

342
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,380
all of the other ones, thankfully, are inside walls,

343
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
and so you can't see them,

344
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,420
but there's a massive support structure downstairs

345
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,420
to support this upstairs, the sanctuary.

346
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,940
In fact, during COVID, actually prior to COVID,

347
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,100
but through COVID, we replaced a lot of things downstairs,

348
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,740
did a renovation downstairs,

349
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,220
where we placed all of the lights up in the ceilings,

350
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,500
and some of them were extremely challenging

351
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,380
because of their proximity to some of those steel beams

352
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,740
that support this structure.

353
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,980
So you think about supporting,

354
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,620
you think about caring for someone,

355
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,620
about holding someone up, and I ask this question

356
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,780
as we look at this instruction in 1 Thessalonians 5,

357
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,420
in verse number 14, where the Bible says support the weak.

358
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,580
We've sought to identify who they are

359
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,940
and why maybe they are weak,

360
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,620
but then what can I do about it?

361
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,620
How can I, how can you support the weak?

362
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,580
Well, I believe that one great way is through edification.

363
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,020
To edify, the word actually, the word edify is a word

364
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,100
that is adopted into biblical language

365
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,780
that was specifically used during that time,

366
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,140
in that era, in construction work,

367
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,260
and it means to build up, that's what it means.

368
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
And so Paul, obviously,

369
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,780
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

370
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,340
was able to adopt that word from that common usage

371
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,660
and put it into the church, into the biblical language,

372
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,340
to help us to understand the importance of edification

373
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,500
and how we're to edify one another,

374
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,820
building one another up,

375
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,100
thus, I believe, supporting those that need support.

376
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,180
And look at some verses with me, if you will.

377
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,260
We're gonna kind of thumb through

378
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,580
a number of verses this evening.

379
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,900
Look at Romans chapter 14, if you will,

380
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,300
and I want you to think about this idea of edify.

381
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,300
How do we edify the believers?

382
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,620
How do we edify those that God has called us

383
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,980
to support, support the weak?

384
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,300
He didn't say ignore them.

385
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,820
He didn't say to do any of those.

386
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,660
No, he said support them.

387
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,020
Notice in Romans 14, in verse 19,

388
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,580
the Bible says this, in Romans 14, 19,

389
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,060
let us, therefore, follow after the things

390
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,980
which make for peace,

391
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,980
and things wherewith one may edify another.

392
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,340
And look at verse number one of chapter 15.

393
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,260
As you continue the same thought, he says,

394
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,420
we then that are strong

395
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,060
ought to bear the infirmities of the weak

396
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,940
and not to please ourselves.

397
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,740
And so we find that even within the context,

398
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,300
he's talking about various things here

399
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,620
that they're dealing with,

400
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,340
but we find that here,

401
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,780
Paul is speaking about the subject of edification

402
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,580
in verse 19 of chapter 14.

403
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,420
He's speaking about those that are strong,

404
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,300
bearing the infirmities of the weak

405
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,140
that we're not seeking to please ourselves.

406
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,220
Paul would say this,

407
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,980
in fact, we'll see that he says,

408
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,780
as he's writing to the church in Thessalon,

409
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,180
or excuse me, in Corinth,

410
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,660
he says, listen, all things don't edify.

411
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
Not everything edifies.

412
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,660
And we find that this evening,

413
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,500
it's not, it's the situation

414
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,980
where thinking about others

415
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,140
and being active and trying to support those

416
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,500
that need that support.

417
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,180
And we find that here in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

418
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,140
Notice, this is the verse that I was just speaking of.

419
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,100
It's a great principle to live by

420
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,940
in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

421
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,940
How many of you have heard somebody say,

422
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,380
in this modern era of Christianity,

423
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,620
will I feel like it and I can do it?

424
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Yeah, I mean, it is prevalent

425
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,660
in this modern era of Christianity.

426
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,380
It just, it makes me happy and I'm gonna do it.

427
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,780
That's just foreign to God's word, amen?

428
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,860
And we find here that,

429
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,780
notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 23.

430
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,420
He says, all things are lawful for me,

431
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,060
but all things are not expedient.

432
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,420
All things are lawful for me,

433
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,620
but all things edify not.

434
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,300
So as I begin to think about the instruction,

435
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,740
and Paul would obviously apply the instruction

436
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,900
even in his own life,

437
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,820
that he used to be in the ministry of edifying,

438
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,180
of supporting the weak, of building people up,

439
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,900
trying to help them to grow.

440
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,060
I think about those that are weak spiritually

441
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,500
and trying to encourage them

442
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,180
and help them to grow spiritually.

443
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,420
We're edifying, we're building up.

444
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,460
He says, listen, I'm gonna try to do those things

445
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,540
that are going to edify.

446
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,380
Because if we understand the admonition

447
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,460
to edify one another,

448
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,420
then those are the things that we ought to be doing.

449
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,260
Look at the instruction of the church at Ephesus

450
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,020
in Ephesians chapter four.

451
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Ephesians chapter number four.

452
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,900
In Ephesians chapter number four in verse number 11,

453
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,740
the Bible says, and he gave some apostles

454
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,660
and some prophets and some evangelists

455
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,300
and some pastors and teachers for what purpose?

456
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,820
For the perfecting of the saints,

457
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,940
for the work of the ministry.

458
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,500
Notice this, for the edifying of the body of Christ.

459
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,940
Notice in verse number 29,

460
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,260
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,

461
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,540
but that which is good,

462
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,380
notice, to the use of edifying,

463
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,820
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

464
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,460
You know, your speech and my speech can edify.

465
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,100
I preached a message years ago on Mother's Day,

466
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,380
building up or plucking down.

467
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,540
You know, our tongue can be used to build people up

468
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,820
or to tear people down.

469
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,020
No doubt, you've experienced a time in your life

470
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,140
where you've experienced a time in your life

471
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,380
where you've experienced a time in your life

472
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,780
where you've experienced a time in your life

473
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,600
life where you've either been the recipient, you've been the one giving it, or you've just

474
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,620
overheard someone using their tongue in such a way to tear someone down.

475
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,060
We can use our speech, notice he says that we're to use that which is for the use of

476
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,820
edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers.

477
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,460
So we can use our speech as we support the weak, we're going to try to point them to

478
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,180
Christ and edify, encourage them, lift them up, build them up.

479
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,580
We find that in 1 Thessalonians 5 we've mentioned in verse 14 the text of our study this evening,

480
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,180
but in verse number 11, a few verses before, he says, wherefore, comfort yourself together

481
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,180
and edify one another, even as also you do.

482
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:57,780
This ministry, if you will, of edification, begin to think about those that are weak and

483
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,060
what do we do and how do we support and obviously through edification, through exhortation,

484
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,220
we're to exhort one another, we're to provoke one another into love and good works, we're

485
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,220
to encourage one another, all of those things that we are to do and I believe that those

486
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,940
all feed into supporting the weak.

487
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,740
But let's look at two Bible examples, the number one is from the life of Moses, turn

488
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,100
back if you will to the book of Exodus and look at Exodus chapter 17, I want you to look

489
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,900
in the life of Moses.

490
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,540
Moses was a man that God used to lead, humanly speaking, the children of Israel.

491
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,100
Begin to think about Moses, a lot of great things that God used Moses to do, he stood

492
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,180
before Pharaoh and many miracles and you think about the plagues and all of the amazing things

493
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,580
that took place and we find that after the plagues in Exodus 17, the plagues have been

494
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,180
completed, they've left Egypt, they've crossed the Red Sea, of course they deal with a couple

495
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,140
of times already of not having water, they had the bitter waters at Marah at the end

496
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,700
of chapter 15.

497
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,460
We find chapter 16 a great chapter dealing with God's provision and the instruction that

498
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,580
Moses gives with regard to manna and all of that and how God would provide for them.

499
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Chapter 17 begins in this chapter with a place where they come to in Rephidim where there's

500
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,280
no water.

501
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,460
But the chapter ends with a battle and in this battle we find that the Bible tells us

502
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
something very interesting.

503
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,820
In verse number 11 of Exodus 17, they're having a battle, the children of Israel with the

504
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,740
Amalekites, the Bible says in verse number 11, and it came to pass when Moses held up

505
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,460
his hand that Israel prevailed.

506
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,940
And when he let down his hand, Alek prevailed.

507
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,060
And the Bible tells us this in verse number 12, but Moses' hands were heavy.

508
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,140
Have you ever tried to lift, I mean, just keep your hand up, you could say, I could

509
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
hold my hand up all day.

510
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
You know you're going to get tired?

511
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,860
You're going to get tired.

512
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,560
We were working out at home and we were joking around, Joseph and I, this is probably a year

513
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,140
ago now, and I said, how many bicep curls could you do with a, like a 10-pound dumbbell?

514
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,640
It's like, oh, man, you could do 10-pound dumbbell arm curls forever.

515
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,780
And I sat there and I got to like number 75, 76, and my bicep, I felt like it was going

516
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
to explode.

517
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,740
I mean, it was just tearing it down.

518
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,300
But you pick up a 10-pound dumbbell and you're like, this is no big deal, until you try to

519
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,720
do 100 of them, and then all of a sudden it's a big deal.

520
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,420
And so Moses, as his hands were lifted up, they had victory, but as his hands fell, they

521
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,460
had defeat.

522
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,860
And the Bible says that Moses' hands were heavy.

523
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,540
So what happens, well, we're familiar, many of us, with this text.

524
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,820
It says in verse number 12, and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon.

525
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,180
Now, is that going to make it easier for him to hold his hands?

526
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Sure.

527
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
I mean, he's not standing up holding his hands.

528
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,980
He can sit down and hold his hands, but still his hands are going to get heavy.

529
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,020
His hands are going to fall.

530
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:15,740
And so the Bible tells us, and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands.

531
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,340
They stayed up his hands.

532
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,900
The one on the one side and the other on the other side, and his hands were steady until

533
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,700
the going down of the sun.

534
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,840
And I want you to understand, as you look at this passage of Scripture and you see what's

535
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,220
happening, that Moses, the servant of the Lord, the man that God is using to lead his

536
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:40,140
people, we find that he physically, he gets weak in this situation because any of us

537
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
would.

538
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,780
Aren't you thankful for Aaron and Hur?

539
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,980
Aaron and Hur.

540
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,600
You know, sometimes we support the weak.

541
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,460
We just come alongside and support them.

542
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,240
It's not going to be in the same context that we see here with Moses, with someone

543
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,800
trying to lift up their hands with a battle that's taking place.

544
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:07,720
But we find this evening that the ministry of Aaron and Hur in this particular setting

545
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,140
in this time allowed for a great victory to be wrought.

546
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,860
This evening, Moses, he needed someone to support him in that hour.

547
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,500
We don't know when our hour is going to be that we need someone to support us.

548
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,800
We understand that we are to take the exhortation of 1 Thessalonians 5.14, support the weak

549
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,040
that we identify who they are, and we try to support them, to come alongside them, to

550
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,600
encourage them, to care for them, to hold them up, to edify them.

551
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
We find another example that I like to use is the life of Hezekiah.

552
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,320
Turn over if you will to 2 Chronicles chapter number 32.

553
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:56,040
In 2 Chronicles chapter 32, we find that in this portion of Scripture, there's the battle

554
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,880
that's going to take place between Judah, it actually never takes place because God

555
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,640
handles the situation with the Assyrians, but the Assyrians come and Sennacherib and

556
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,080
Rabshakka and they're saying all of these things and really what they're trying to do,

557
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,160
what Rabshakka's trying to do is to discourage the heart of the people of God.

558
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,880
And Rabshakka's going through this thing and he's telling them about all of the victories

559
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,900
that they've had and all of the people that have fallen to them and how they've been so

560
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,380
victorious and all of these things, all with the intent of trying to discourage the people,

561
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
to weaken them.

562
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:39,500
That's what the enemy wants to do, he wants to weaken your faith, he wants to weaken you.

563
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,860
But I want you to see how God used Hezekiah.

564
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,460
In verse number 7, Hezekiah says this to the people of God, he says,

565
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,660
Be strong and courageous.

566
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,140
Be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is

567
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
with him.

568
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,420
And by the way, it was a large multitude.

569
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,780
Notice what he says, for there be more with us than with him.

570
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:20,300
With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight

571
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,940
our battles.

572
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:29,100
The Bible says that the people, notice this, rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah,

573
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,340
king of Judah.

574
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:38,980
You know, God used Hezekiah at this particular time in Judah's history to support the people.

575
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,780
He's the king, he has this responsibility.

576
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:48,260
By the way, Hezekiah had sought the face of God, Hezekiah sent for the man of God, Isaiah

577
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,100
was the prophet, and he sends for him to get some instruction, to understand what's taking

578
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
place.

579
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,260
But we find that as he, Hezekiah, delivers this message to the people of God, that they

580
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,740
would be supported in that situation through the words of Hezekiah.

581
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
What does he do?

582
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
He points them to God.

583
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,540
I love verse number eight when he says, with him, because really, if you look at verse

584
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,140
number seven, when he ends it and says, hey, listen, there's more with us than with him.

585
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:26,980
Some rascal in the crowd could be like, hey, Hezekiah, do you not see all of that out there?

586
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:35,660
But notice what Hezekiah says, with him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our

587
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,060
God to help us.

588
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,860
Can I tell you this evening that God is still our helper?

589
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,380
God is our helper.

590
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,500
This is an Old Testament passage of scripture in 2 Chronicles chapter 32, but the reality

591
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,580
is that still today, God is our helper.

592
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,980
We find that we deal with all sorts of spiritual battle and warfare and all things that take

593
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,540
place, but we can rejoice in knowing that God is a very present help in the time of

594
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
trouble.

595
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,540
I love that quote from Psalms, but God is our helper.

596
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,980
Every single day of our lives, God is our helper.

597
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,620
Remember what it says in Hebrews 13, the Bible says, let your conversation be without covetousness

598
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,020
and be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave thee

599
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:33,060
nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper and I will not fear

600
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,260
what man shall do unto me, Hebrews 13, verses 5 and 6.

601
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,820
The Lord is, he says, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

602
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:51,220
You know, sometimes the individual that's weak needs someone, a stronger, mature brother

603
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,020
or sister in Christ to come alongside and point them to Jesus.

604
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:03,060
Not to criticize, not to condemn, not to look down upon, but to seek to build up, to

605
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,780
support them, to help them in their time of need, to help

606
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,460
them with regard to whatever those circumstances are that were leading them in this place of

607
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,900
being weak.

608
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,620
You think about Elijah.

609
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,460
Elijah, we think so often of calling fire down from heaven.

610
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,220
I mean, he prayed.

611
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,940
It was a great scene as you study there in 1 Kings.

612
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:35,740
But you know, just a couple of chapters later, Jezebel made some comments and Elijah was

613
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,820
like let me just die, right?

614
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,380
God met him.

615
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,260
God supported him and encouraged him and helped him.

616
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,900
This evening, God wants to use us.

617
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,140
He says in 1 Thessalonians 5, support the weak.

618
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,300
Support the weak.

619
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,140
I know I ended it last week by saying you may comfort someone today and you may need

620
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,700
comfort tomorrow.

621
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:07,020
The reality is that the way the family works, the family of God, is that there are different

622
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,340
times within the family, within the church family, that there are going to be times that

623
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,860
different people are dealing with different things.

624
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,500
And there might be some that are weak today that may not be weak next month.

625
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,900
And some that are strong today that may be weak next month.

626
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,540
Because we don't know what's on tomorrow.

627
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,220
We know who holds tomorrow.

628
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,340
We know who's in control.

629
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,020
But we're all just frail human beings.

630
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,060
And God says to the church at Thessalonica, he says to every church through the church

631
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,100
age, he says to us tonight, support the weak.

632
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Come alongside them.

633
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Help them.

634
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Comfort them.

635
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Edify.

636
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
Build them up.

637
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,660
And God's given that instruction.

638
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:59,340
What a blessing to think back in my life of those that I would say supported me in times

639
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
of weakness.

640
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,700
I hope that you can look back at your life and your spiritual journey and you could look

641
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,340
at times perhaps of weakness in your life.

642
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,080
You could say, you know, God used some servants of the Lord, he used some brothers and sisters

643
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,640
in Christ to support me in my time of weakness.

644
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,740
To say just that right word, to point me to that right verse, to pray for me at that moment.

645
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,300
And man, it gave me the support that I needed.

646
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,300
And perhaps you can think also of times in your life, of your journey where God has enabled

647
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,300
you to support someone else that was weak.

648
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:47,100
You never know the impact of just a phone call can have in the life of someone.

649
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,580
Someone goes to a doctor's appointment, they think it's routine and it's not.

650
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,980
Someone gets a phone call totally unexpected of something.

651
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Life can change in a moment.

652
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,420
And so God says, the all-knowing, eternal God, he says there are going to be some people

653
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,580
in the church that are unruly, warn them.

654
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,980
There are going to be some people that are feeble-minded, comfort them.

655
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,980
There are going to be some people that are weak, support them.

656
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,180
In each of those pieces of instruction in verse number 14 of 1 Thessalonians 5, it's

657
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,380
an active role that we take.

658
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,840
It's an engaged role.

659
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,120
We don't just look at the unruly and ignore them and think, well, it's just going to take

660
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,240
care of itself.

661
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,640
It never does.

662
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,400
It never does.

663
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,760
It becomes a bigger problem.

664
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,680
You don't just ignore the feeble-minded and say, well, they'll just get over it.

665
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,880
You don't just look at the weak and say, well, they'll have, somebody else will, no, no.

666
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,000
It's an active role that the believers in the church, the brethren, he says, I exhort

667
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,920
you to do these things.

668
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,280
These are active things, warn, comfort, and support.

669
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,240
What great instruction, I mean, applicable instruction for every local church.

670
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Let's pray together.

671
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,600
Father, we love you.

672
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
We thank you for loving us.

673
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,800
We thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

674
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,000
I pray that, Lord, you would help us to support the weak.

675
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,880
Lord, some that might be weak physically, Lord, some that might be weak spiritually,

676
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,400
Lord, I pray that you would help us to be sensitive to the needs of others, Lord, that

677
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:30,480
we would be active in seeking to build up, to edify the brothers and sisters in Christ

678
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,880
that we'd come alongside and support them.

679
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Lord, I pray that you'd give us wisdom and strength.

680
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,020
I pray, Lord, that you'd bless our time of prayer.

681
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,280
We thank you for the opportunity.

682
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,320
