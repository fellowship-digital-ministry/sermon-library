WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.559
and we'll continue here in verse number 14.

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:07.199
I love the instruction given to the church at Thessalonica

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:08.920
at the conclusion of each letter.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.939
We've mentioned this several times now,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.319
but at the end of 1 Thessalonians in chapter number five,

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.479
beginning in verse number 12,

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.799
down through the end of the chapter,

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.940
and then again in 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.799
both letters that are written to the believers

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.920
at Thessalonica, this church that's a model church,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.799
a good church, a church that was serving the Lord,

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:29.559
a church that was loving the brethren,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.600
a church that was sending forth the gospel.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.479
I mean, a good church,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.959
but they're given these words of instruction,

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:40.139
and I love the instruction.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:44.099
It's concise, but it's also very applicable,

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.779
and we understand that these truths

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.919
need to be incorporated into our lives.

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:52.040
We've said often that the word of God is profitable,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.880
and we understand this evening,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.479
and as we've studied here for a number of weeks now

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.220
this portion of scripture,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.259
that as we look at these portions

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.819
and these commands, if you will,

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.040
that it's very applicable.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.500
I mean, it's straightforward, and we take the truth,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.739
and we incorporate that truth in our lives

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.099
so that we might have the opportunity to walk worthy

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:14.500
and to please the Lord.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.319
Tonight, we'll be looking at really the third command

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.019
in verse number 14.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.220
It says this, I'll read the entire verse.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.180
It says, now we exhort you, brethren,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.360
warn them that are unruly,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.199
comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:31.319
be patient toward all men.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.120
And so the last couple of weeks,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.239
we've looked at this verse of scripture,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.800
and the Lord knows all things.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.000
Aren't you thankful that God knows everything?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.959
And he knows all things.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.319
He has all wisdom.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.080
He is outside of time, and so he knows everything,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.879
and he's given us a Bible that contains instruction

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:54.879
that is really, it's relevant for every era of human history.

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.040
Why?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.319
Because it's written by the eternal God.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.160
There are some that say,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.319
well, the Bible's not relevant anymore.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.019
No, it is relevant because it was written by God.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.440
All scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.880
and is profitable, and so the Bible is relevant,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.720
and God, who knows all things,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.639
he knew that there would be some that would be unruly.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.320
And those folks, he says, they need to be warned.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.679
He knew that there would some that would be feeble-minded.

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:27.600
They would be weak and dealing with the little of spirit,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.839
if you will, easily discouraged,

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.919
and he said that those folks, they need to be comforted,

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.320
and we dealt with that last week

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.360
and talked about how that encouragement,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.960
that word comfort, literally has the idea

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.000
of speaking with someone in close proximity

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.119
and how you come close to someone

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.179
and you try to encourage them and speak those words to them,

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.399
point them to Jesus, and what a great truth.

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.240
This evening, as we look here

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.720
and we see the third command in this verse of scripture,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.039
that we are to support the weak,

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.139
and so God knew that there would be some that would be weak

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.279
and they would need to be supported.

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.119
I believe that a church is a family, amen?

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:13.039
And often we refer to our church as a church family.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.119
We use the terminology of speaking

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.720
of brothers and sisters in Christ,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.039
and we understand that as we have been born again,

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.679
as we've been adopted in the family of God,

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.800
and we are family, and it's exciting,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.160
and it's appropriate, it's God-ordained

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.360
that a church family acts as a family,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.559
and as there will be times in which

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.039
there are some within the family who are weak,

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.520
that they need to be supported.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.000
And so we find that the instruction is support the weak.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.240
I've just titled the lesson that tonight, Support the Weak,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.559
and let me answer a couple of questions

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.080
as we go through it this evening.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.919
I'm kinda gonna teach through it by asking questions.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.000
The first one is this, who are the weak?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.600
Who are the weak?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.800
Well, really, as I said last week,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.679
I said that you may encourage today

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.160
and you may need encouragement tomorrow.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440
I ended the service last Wednesday evening

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.160
with that statement, and the reality this evening

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000
is that there could be any of us

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.959
at any given time that could be weak.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.079
And when we talk about being weak,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.040
I believe really there are two categories

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.640
in which we can look to,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.880
and one of them would be physically.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.720
We could speak about being physically weak.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.040
Some are weak physically, and I don't think

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.119
that's the main emphasis of this verse of Scripture,

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:35.679
though there is application with regard

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.399
to those that are physically weak.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:40.959
Maybe some are weak physically as a result of age.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:45.600
Each of us have understood, and I still am relatively young.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.399
I like to think of myself as a young man,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.480
but the reality is that as we grow older,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.119
we do find ourselves, even in my mid-40s,

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.880
I find myself not having the strength

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.679
that I did when I was 18.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.040
And some of you say, wait until you're 60,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.200
or 70, or fill in the blank, and I understand,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.920
but what I'm saying is that each of us

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.880
can acknowledge in our lives, wherever we are,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.600
that physical weakness can happen

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.320
really just as a result of age.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.519
You can read Ecclesiastes, and you can read

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.279
how that all of those members, they begin to fail,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.600
and that's just what happens.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.519
Our bodies begin to break down,

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.359
and so there are some that are weak physically

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.320
that's simply a result of age,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.279
but we find that there are some that are weak physically

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.920
that perhaps might be a result

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920
of some type of physical condition, a medical condition,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.359
some physical ailment.

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:41.399
I think about times when you think about the Apostle Paul

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.880
who God would use to pen these words of instruction.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.720
There were times in which he faced great persecution,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.799
and physically, outwardly, he was weak.

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:55.559
And there was some times in which there were some brothers

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.359
and some church families and some sisters in Christ

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.760
that came and supported him through those times

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.119
of great persecution in his life,

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.839
and so we find that there's definitely an aspect

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.200
when we consider the thought of support the weak,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.279
but there could be some that are physically weak

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.480
that need some support.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.760
I think about this,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.359
not only who are the weak speaking of physically,

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:21.679
but think about this of those that are weak spiritually,

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:23.399
those who are weak spiritually.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.440
Now, some are weak spiritually

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.040
simply because they're babes in Christ.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.279
You know, each and every one of us at one point

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.480
in our spiritual lives, we were a babe in Christ.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.679
When you got saved, when you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:40.760
as your personal Savior, you were a babe in Christ,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.839
and we find that as a babe in Christ,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.720
and I try at times in my life

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.880
to look back at my spiritual journey,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.679
and I shared with someone yesterday,

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:49.799
I was giving a gospel tract,

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:52.119
and I mentioned how the truth in that tract

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.160
changed my life over 25 years ago,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.440
and I encouraged them to read it,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.559
and I asked them to give me a commitment

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:59.119
that they would read the gospel tract.

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.519
I did not have opportunity to speak with them

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:03.640
at any type of length of time,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.920
but simply to share that simple thought and that challenge,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.660
and they said, I will read it, and I hope that they will,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.940
but the reality is that I do not,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.980
when I look back at my spiritual journey,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.380
when I look back at my life as a believer,

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.820
I was weak when I first got saved.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.700
I was a babe.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.459
I didn't know a whole lot of things, and neither did you.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:27.420
I'm gonna think about, obviously,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.700
with having Evan and Juliana and Nova around recently

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.260
and thinking about being a babe physically

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.220
and thinking about Nova as a baby,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.579
and you can make some spiritual application

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:41.899
with regard to even as God does in his word,

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:44.619
as newborn babes desire that's the seer milk of the word,

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:48.059
why, that ye may grow thereby,

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:50.540
and so we find that there is a need

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.480
for those babes in Christ to be supported.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.140
We don't look at a babe in Christ

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.940
and kind of look down our nose,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.059
I can't believe they don't know that.

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:02.359
Hold on a minute.

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:04.899
We didn't know it either if someone didn't take some time

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:09.100
to invest in us and teach us and support us, amen,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.859
and sometimes, if we're not careful,

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.899
as we would grow mature in the Lord,

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:16.660
as we would understand some things,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.019
we could, if we're not careful,

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.220
look at some that are babes in Christ

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.959
and wonder why do they do what they do?

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:27.140
Well, maybe they just haven't been taught,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.779
and we need to be aware of that.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.019
Some are weak spiritually

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.520
simply because they're babes in Christ.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.219
Some, however, are weak spiritually

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:38.140
because they've just not grown like they should.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.719
That's a totally different category.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:42.820
In fact, Paul deals with that.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.619
I believe that he's the human penman

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:45.840
for the book of Hebrews,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.940
and he deals with that with strong language.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.659
In the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:53.020
you have need that one teach you,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.940
and at the end of chapter number five,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.539
he deals with that in Hebrews,

00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:59.619
and the reality is that Paul is saying to those believers,

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:01.799
listen, you've been saved for a long time,

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.380
and you're not where you ought to be.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.940
You need to grow.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.539
There's, and you think about the church in Corinth.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:09.299
We know that Paul wrote the book

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.780
of First and Second Corinthians humanly speaking,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.979
and as he's ministering to those people in Corinth,

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:17.020
he says I can't speak to you as spiritual,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.419
but as carnal, why?

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:20.500
Because you're babes in Christ.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500
You're just carnal, and I can't,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.659
there's so many things I want to tell you, but I can't,

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:27.700
and so we find there's a category of folks

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.700
that might be weak spiritually

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.859
because they've just not grown like they should.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.559
Maybe they've not gotten plugged in.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.700
Maybe they've not gotten involved

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.380
at some level of discipleship,

00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:39.140
and faithful attendance to church.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.780
You know, the reality is that you cannot make someone grow.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.059
You just can't do it.

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:47.140
I can't make decisions for you.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.140
You can't make decisions for someone else.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.940
All you can do is give them truth,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.619
and you can give them the opportunities to be able to grow,

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:57.219
but the reality is that there's some desire

00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:59.380
on their part that is necessary,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.780
and then they need to grow.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.340
to apply those things in their lives.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.620
Perhaps, as we think about those that are weak spiritually,

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.180
perhaps there's a third category

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.920
that we should consider this evening.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.960
There are some that have experienced great persecution

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.760
and are weak spiritually as a result.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.360
It's just kind of really shaken them.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.460
I think about the believers that Paul is writing to

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.860
in the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.940
and I consider what they've dealt with,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.440
and we've addressed it in several of our messages,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.100
but in chapter number three,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.040
we find that Paul specifically mentions the afflictions

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.500
that they were dealing with,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.200
and he says about those afflictions,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.700
he talks about the tempter tempting them,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.740
and we know that that would be Satan,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.820
and those afflictions that they're dealing with,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.940
and he says that he was concerned

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.020
that it would move them in the sense

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.280
that they would no longer be doing

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.820
the things that they ought to be doing.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.020
Notice how he says it.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.120
In 1 Thessalonians 3, in verse number five,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.660
he says, for this cause, when I could no longer forbear,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.660
I sent to know your faith.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.420
I wanted to know why, lest by some means

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.420
the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.940
I mean, that's the terminology that is used.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.640
I think about the believers in the churches

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.380
in the region of Galatia.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.500
We find that during the first missionary journey,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.700
the apostle Paul was used of the Lord

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.660
to start these churches in the region of Galatia,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.160
and we find that as Paul is writing to these believers,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.060
there's some spiritual battle that has taken place

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.480
in the region of Galatia.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.300
To understand the context, there were false teachers

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.020
that came into the region, Judaizers, they were coming in.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.020
In fact, they were saying, we can read it in Acts 15,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.360
and we can understand exactly what they were saying,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.620
that unless you're circumcised after the manner of Moses,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.540
you cannot be saved.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.300
Now, that's completely contradictory to the message

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.140
that was preached by the apostle Paul,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.100
and there was a great discussion that took place,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.220
a council at the church at Jerusalem to address that,

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.080
but there were people that were affected

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.040
by this false teaching, by these levels of persecution

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.300
that they were dealing with in the false teaching,

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.120
and Paul says this to them in Galatians 5,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.120
in verse number seven, he says, ye did run well.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.360
Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.340
They were weak spiritually because of some

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.380
of the opposition that they were dealing with,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.840
and some of the false teaching that was invading

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.960
the churches there in the region of Galatia,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.600
and so we find that there's really a couple of categories,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.320
I believe, that we look at this verse of Scripture

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.560
in 1 Thessalonians 5, in verse 14,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.880
there's a couple of categories of those that are weak,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.380
physically and spiritually, but there are a number

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.440
of reasons why someone might be weak physically,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.220
there are a number of reasons why someone

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.700
might be weak spiritually.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.980
So we seek to answer the question, who are the weak?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.080
We wanna be able to identify, if the Bible tells us

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.620
if the instruction, the exhortation, is to support

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.380
the weak, we need to be able to know who the weak are,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.180
being able to identify them so that we can fulfill

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.240
the instruction that is being given to do what?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.980
Well, to support them.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.580
We find that really, what we're to do,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.940
if you think about the second thought this evening,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.100
who are the weak, but then number two,

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.400
what do we do for the weak?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.620
Well, it says to support them, to care for them,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.460
to hold them up, I think about a building,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.500
a structure, and you think about a support system.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.040
You think about the importance of building a structure,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.580
obviously foundation is important, but there are,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.540
sometimes we'll use this term of a wall

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.140
that is a weight-bearing, a load-bearing wall.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.780
Now what happens if you take that wall out?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.580
You got a problem, right?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.500
You decide, hey, we're gonna do some renovations,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.940
you just start tearing down walls without finding out

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.820
which one is load-bearing, you might have a real problem

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.980
on your hands.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.180
There's a big pole downstairs in the junior church room,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.460
it's actually almost, it's a little bit,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.780
maybe right where that first pew is,

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.660
somewhere in that area, there's a pole down there

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.020
that's right in the middle of the room.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.780
We've actually had a couple of people run right into it,

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.980
I don't know what they were looking at

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.860
or what they were doing, but it just kinda in the way,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.180
and you look at that thing and say,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.380
man, that's in a bad spot.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.420
Yeah, but it's holding us up.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.980
You can't just remove it, right?

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.660
You can't remove that because that is supporting this.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.580
And then there are a series of them,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.380
all of the other ones, thankfully, are inside walls,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.380
and so you can't see them,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.420
but there's a massive support structure downstairs

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.420
to support this upstairs, the sanctuary.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.940
In fact, during COVID, actually prior to COVID,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.100
but through COVID, we replaced a lot of things downstairs,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.740
did a renovation downstairs,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.220
where we placed all of the lights up in the ceilings,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.500
and some of them were extremely challenging

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.380
because of their proximity to some of those steel beams

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.740
that support this structure.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.980
So you think about supporting,

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.620
you think about caring for someone,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.620
about holding someone up, and I ask this question

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.780
as we look at this instruction in 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.420
in verse number 14, where the Bible says support the weak.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.580
We've sought to identify who they are

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.940
and why maybe they are weak,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.620
but then what can I do about it?

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.620
How can I, how can you support the weak?

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.580
Well, I believe that one great way is through edification.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.020
To edify, the word actually, the word edify is a word

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.100
that is adopted into biblical language

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.780
that was specifically used during that time,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.140
in that era, in construction work,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.260
and it means to build up, that's what it means.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
And so Paul, obviously,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.780
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.340
was able to adopt that word from that common usage

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.660
and put it into the church, into the biblical language,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.340
to help us to understand the importance of edification

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.500
and how we're to edify one another,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.820
building one another up,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.100
thus, I believe, supporting those that need support.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.180
And look at some verses with me, if you will.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.260
We're gonna kind of thumb through

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.580
a number of verses this evening.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.900
Look at Romans chapter 14, if you will,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.300
and I want you to think about this idea of edify.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.300
How do we edify the believers?

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.620
How do we edify those that God has called us

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.980
to support, support the weak?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.300
He didn't say ignore them.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.820
He didn't say to do any of those.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.660
No, he said support them.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.020
Notice in Romans 14, in verse 19,

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.580
the Bible says this, in Romans 14, 19,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.060
let us, therefore, follow after the things

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.980
which make for peace,

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.980
and things wherewith one may edify another.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.340
And look at verse number one of chapter 15.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.260
As you continue the same thought, he says,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.420
we then that are strong

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.060
ought to bear the infirmities of the weak

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.940
and not to please ourselves.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.740
And so we find that even within the context,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.300
he's talking about various things here

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.620
that they're dealing with,

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.340
but we find that here,

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.780
Paul is speaking about the subject of edification

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.580
in verse 19 of chapter 14.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.420
He's speaking about those that are strong,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.300
bearing the infirmities of the weak

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.140
that we're not seeking to please ourselves.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.220
Paul would say this,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.980
in fact, we'll see that he says,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.780
as he's writing to the church in Thessalon,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.180
or excuse me, in Corinth,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.660
he says, listen, all things don't edify.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.500
Not everything edifies.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.660
And we find that this evening,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.500
it's not, it's the situation

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.980
where thinking about others

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.140
and being active and trying to support those

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.500
that need that support.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.180
And we find that here in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.140
Notice, this is the verse that I was just speaking of.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.100
It's a great principle to live by

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.940
in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.940
How many of you have heard somebody say,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.380
in this modern era of Christianity,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.620
will I feel like it and I can do it?

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.860
Yeah, I mean, it is prevalent

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.660
in this modern era of Christianity.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.380
It just, it makes me happy and I'm gonna do it.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.780
That's just foreign to God's word, amen?

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.860
And we find here that,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.780
notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 23.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.420
He says, all things are lawful for me,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.060
but all things are not expedient.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.420
All things are lawful for me,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.620
but all things edify not.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.300
So as I begin to think about the instruction,

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.740
and Paul would obviously apply the instruction

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.900
even in his own life,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.820
that he used to be in the ministry of edifying,

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.180
of supporting the weak, of building people up,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.900
trying to help them to grow.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.060
I think about those that are weak spiritually

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.500
and trying to encourage them

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.180
and help them to grow spiritually.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.420
We're edifying, we're building up.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.460
He says, listen, I'm gonna try to do those things

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.540
that are going to edify.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.380
Because if we understand the admonition

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.460
to edify one another,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.420
then those are the things that we ought to be doing.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.260
Look at the instruction of the church at Ephesus

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.020
in Ephesians chapter four.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.020
Ephesians chapter number four.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.900
In Ephesians chapter number four in verse number 11,

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.740
the Bible says, and he gave some apostles

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.660
and some prophets and some evangelists

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.300
and some pastors and teachers for what purpose?

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.820
For the perfecting of the saints,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.940
for the work of the ministry.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.500
Notice this, for the edifying of the body of Christ.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.940
Notice in verse number 29,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.260
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.540
but that which is good,

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.380
notice, to the use of edifying,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.820
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.460
You know, your speech and my speech can edify.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.100
I preached a message years ago on Mother's Day,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.380
building up or plucking down.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.540
You know, our tongue can be used to build people up

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.820
or to tear people down.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.020
No doubt, you've experienced a time in your life

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.140
where you've experienced a time in your life

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.380
where you've experienced a time in your life

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.780
where you've experienced a time in your life

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.600
life where you've either been the recipient, you've been the one giving it, or you've just

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.620
overheard someone using their tongue in such a way to tear someone down.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:23.060
We can use our speech, notice he says that we're to use that which is for the use of

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.820
edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.460
So we can use our speech as we support the weak, we're going to try to point them to

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.180
Christ and edify, encourage them, lift them up, build them up.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.580
We find that in 1 Thessalonians 5 we've mentioned in verse 14 the text of our study this evening,

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.180
but in verse number 11, a few verses before, he says, wherefore, comfort yourself together

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.180
and edify one another, even as also you do.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.780
This ministry, if you will, of edification, begin to think about those that are weak and

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.060
what do we do and how do we support and obviously through edification, through exhortation,

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.220
we're to exhort one another, we're to provoke one another into love and good works, we're

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.220
to encourage one another, all of those things that we are to do and I believe that those

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.940
all feed into supporting the weak.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.740
But let's look at two Bible examples, the number one is from the life of Moses, turn

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.100
back if you will to the book of Exodus and look at Exodus chapter 17, I want you to look

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.900
in the life of Moses.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:33.540
Moses was a man that God used to lead, humanly speaking, the children of Israel.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.100
Begin to think about Moses, a lot of great things that God used Moses to do, he stood

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:44.180
before Pharaoh and many miracles and you think about the plagues and all of the amazing things

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.580
that took place and we find that after the plagues in Exodus 17, the plagues have been

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:55.180
completed, they've left Egypt, they've crossed the Red Sea, of course they deal with a couple

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:01.140
of times already of not having water, they had the bitter waters at Marah at the end

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.700
of chapter 15.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.460
We find chapter 16 a great chapter dealing with God's provision and the instruction that

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.580
Moses gives with regard to manna and all of that and how God would provide for them.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.580
Chapter 17 begins in this chapter with a place where they come to in Rephidim where there's

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.280
no water.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.460
But the chapter ends with a battle and in this battle we find that the Bible tells us

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.820
something very interesting.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.820
In verse number 11 of Exodus 17, they're having a battle, the children of Israel with the

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.740
Amalekites, the Bible says in verse number 11, and it came to pass when Moses held up

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.460
his hand that Israel prevailed.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.940
And when he let down his hand, Alek prevailed.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:51.060
And the Bible tells us this in verse number 12, but Moses' hands were heavy.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.140
Have you ever tried to lift, I mean, just keep your hand up, you could say, I could

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.140
hold my hand up all day.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.140
You know you're going to get tired?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.860
You're going to get tired.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.560
We were working out at home and we were joking around, Joseph and I, this is probably a year

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.140
ago now, and I said, how many bicep curls could you do with a, like a 10-pound dumbbell?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.640
It's like, oh, man, you could do 10-pound dumbbell arm curls forever.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.780
And I sat there and I got to like number 75, 76, and my bicep, I felt like it was going

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.780
to explode.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.740
I mean, it was just tearing it down.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.300
But you pick up a 10-pound dumbbell and you're like, this is no big deal, until you try to

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.720
do 100 of them, and then all of a sudden it's a big deal.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.420
And so Moses, as his hands were lifted up, they had victory, but as his hands fell, they

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.460
had defeat.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.860
And the Bible says that Moses' hands were heavy.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.540
So what happens, well, we're familiar, many of us, with this text.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:55.820
It says in verse number 12, and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.180
Now, is that going to make it easier for him to hold his hands?

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.180
Sure.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.180
I mean, he's not standing up holding his hands.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.980
He can sit down and hold his hands, but still his hands are going to get heavy.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.020
His hands are going to fall.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:15.740
And so the Bible tells us, and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.340
They stayed up his hands.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.900
The one on the one side and the other on the other side, and his hands were steady until

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.700
the going down of the sun.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.840
And I want you to understand, as you look at this passage of Scripture and you see what's

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.220
happening, that Moses, the servant of the Lord, the man that God is using to lead his

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:40.140
people, we find that he physically, he gets weak in this situation because any of us

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.140
would.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.780
Aren't you thankful for Aaron and Hur?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.980
Aaron and Hur.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.600
You know, sometimes we support the weak.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.460
We just come alongside and support them.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.240
It's not going to be in the same context that we see here with Moses, with someone

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.800
trying to lift up their hands with a battle that's taking place.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.720
But we find this evening that the ministry of Aaron and Hur in this particular setting

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.140
in this time allowed for a great victory to be wrought.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.860
This evening, Moses, he needed someone to support him in that hour.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.500
We don't know when our hour is going to be that we need someone to support us.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.800
We understand that we are to take the exhortation of 1 Thessalonians 5.14, support the weak

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:36.040
that we identify who they are, and we try to support them, to come alongside them, to

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.600
encourage them, to care for them, to hold them up, to edify them.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.960
We find another example that I like to use is the life of Hezekiah.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.320
Turn over if you will to 2 Chronicles chapter number 32.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:56.040
In 2 Chronicles chapter 32, we find that in this portion of Scripture, there's the battle

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.880
that's going to take place between Judah, it actually never takes place because God

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.640
handles the situation with the Assyrians, but the Assyrians come and Sennacherib and

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.080
Rabshakka and they're saying all of these things and really what they're trying to do,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.160
what Rabshakka's trying to do is to discourage the heart of the people of God.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.880
And Rabshakka's going through this thing and he's telling them about all of the victories

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.900
that they've had and all of the people that have fallen to them and how they've been so

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.380
victorious and all of these things, all with the intent of trying to discourage the people,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.380
to weaken them.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:39.500
That's what the enemy wants to do, he wants to weaken your faith, he wants to weaken you.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.860
But I want you to see how God used Hezekiah.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:49.460
In verse number 7, Hezekiah says this to the people of God, he says,

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.660
Be strong and courageous.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:59.140
Be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.140
with him.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.420
And by the way, it was a large multitude.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:10.780
Notice what he says, for there be more with us than with him.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:20.300
With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.940
our battles.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:29.100
The Bible says that the people, notice this, rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.340
king of Judah.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:38.980
You know, God used Hezekiah at this particular time in Judah's history to support the people.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.780
He's the king, he has this responsibility.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:48.260
By the way, Hezekiah had sought the face of God, Hezekiah sent for the man of God, Isaiah

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:53.100
was the prophet, and he sends for him to get some instruction, to understand what's taking

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.100
place.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:01.260
But we find that as he, Hezekiah, delivers this message to the people of God, that they

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:07.740
would be supported in that situation through the words of Hezekiah.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.740
What does he do?

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500
He points them to God.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.540
I love verse number eight when he says, with him, because really, if you look at verse

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:20.140
number seven, when he ends it and says, hey, listen, there's more with us than with him.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.980
Some rascal in the crowd could be like, hey, Hezekiah, do you not see all of that out there?

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:35.660
But notice what Hezekiah says, with him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.060
God to help us.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.860
Can I tell you this evening that God is still our helper?

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.380
God is our helper.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:49.500
This is an Old Testament passage of scripture in 2 Chronicles chapter 32, but the reality

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.580
is that still today, God is our helper.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.980
We find that we deal with all sorts of spiritual battle and warfare and all things that take

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:02.540
place, but we can rejoice in knowing that God is a very present help in the time of

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.540
trouble.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.540
I love that quote from Psalms, but God is our helper.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.980
Every single day of our lives, God is our helper.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:17.620
Remember what it says in Hebrews 13, the Bible says, let your conversation be without covetousness

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.020
and be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave thee

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:33.060
nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper and I will not fear

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:39.260
what man shall do unto me, Hebrews 13, verses 5 and 6.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.820
The Lord is, he says, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:51.220
You know, sometimes the individual that's weak needs someone, a stronger, mature brother

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.020
or sister in Christ to come alongside and point them to Jesus.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:03.060
Not to criticize, not to condemn, not to look down upon, but to seek to build up, to

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.780
support them, to help them in their time of need, to help

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:13.460
them with regard to whatever those circumstances are that were leading them in this place of

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.900
being weak.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.620
You think about Elijah.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.460
Elijah, we think so often of calling fire down from heaven.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.220
I mean, he prayed.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.940
It was a great scene as you study there in 1 Kings.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:35.740
But you know, just a couple of chapters later, Jezebel made some comments and Elijah was

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.820
like let me just die, right?

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.380
God met him.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.260
God supported him and encouraged him and helped him.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.900
This evening, God wants to use us.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:53.140
He says in 1 Thessalonians 5, support the weak.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.300
Support the weak.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:00.140
I know I ended it last week by saying you may comfort someone today and you may need

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.700
comfort tomorrow.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.020
The reality is that the way the family works, the family of God, is that there are different

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.340
times within the family, within the church family, that there are going to be times that

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.860
different people are dealing with different things.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.500
And there might be some that are weak today that may not be weak next month.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:24.900
And some that are strong today that may be weak next month.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.540
Because we don't know what's on tomorrow.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.220
We know who holds tomorrow.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.340
We know who's in control.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.020
But we're all just frail human beings.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.060
And God says to the church at Thessalonica, he says to every church through the church

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:43.100
age, he says to us tonight, support the weak.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.100
Come alongside them.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.100
Help them.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.100
Comfort them.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.100
Edify.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.900
Build them up.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.660
And God's given that instruction.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:59.340
What a blessing to think back in my life of those that I would say supported me in times

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.340
of weakness.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.700
I hope that you can look back at your life and your spiritual journey and you could look

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.340
at times perhaps of weakness in your life.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:14.080
You could say, you know, God used some servants of the Lord, he used some brothers and sisters

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.640
in Christ to support me in my time of weakness.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.740
To say just that right word, to point me to that right verse, to pray for me at that moment.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.300
And man, it gave me the support that I needed.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.300
And perhaps you can think also of times in your life, of your journey where God has enabled

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.300
you to support someone else that was weak.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:47.100
You never know the impact of just a phone call can have in the life of someone.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.580
Someone goes to a doctor's appointment, they think it's routine and it's not.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.980
Someone gets a phone call totally unexpected of something.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.980
Life can change in a moment.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.420
And so God says, the all-knowing, eternal God, he says there are going to be some people

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.580
in the church that are unruly, warn them.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.980
There are going to be some people that are feeble-minded, comfort them.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.980
There are going to be some people that are weak, support them.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:20.180
In each of those pieces of instruction in verse number 14 of 1 Thessalonians 5, it's

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.380
an active role that we take.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.840
It's an engaged role.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.120
We don't just look at the unruly and ignore them and think, well, it's just going to take

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.240
care of itself.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.640
It never does.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.400
It never does.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.760
It becomes a bigger problem.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.680
You don't just ignore the feeble-minded and say, well, they'll just get over it.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.880
You don't just look at the weak and say, well, they'll have, somebody else will, no, no.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.000
It's an active role that the believers in the church, the brethren, he says, I exhort

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.920
you to do these things.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.280
These are active things, warn, comfort, and support.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.240
What great instruction, I mean, applicable instruction for every local church.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.240
Let's pray together.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.600
Father, we love you.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.720
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.800
We thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.000
I pray that, Lord, you would help us to support the weak.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.880
Lord, some that might be weak physically, Lord, some that might be weak spiritually,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.400
Lord, I pray that you would help us to be sensitive to the needs of others, Lord, that

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:30.480
we would be active in seeking to build up, to edify the brothers and sisters in Christ

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.880
that we'd come alongside and support them.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.880
Lord, I pray that you'd give us wisdom and strength.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.020
I pray, Lord, that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.280
We thank you for the opportunity.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.320
I pray that you would be honored and glorified for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320
Amen.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.480
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin?

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.840
You did not get one on your way in?
