00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.639
Hebrews chapter number two.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.000
I love the book of Hebrews.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.519
Back in 2020, I preached through the book of Hebrews

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:08.800
on Sunday morning.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.039
Little did I know in October of 2019,

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.319
when God laid the theme for 2020 on my heart,

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:19.500
that it would be looking unto Jesus

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.239
and studying through the book of Hebrews on Sunday morning.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
I had no idea what 2020 would be like,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.239
but of course, it's not been that long ago.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.560
And remember 2020 and COVID and all that was going on.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.959
And what a great theme, looking unto Jesus.

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:39.619
And I could not have orchestrated all of that.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:40.840
That's of the Lord.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.040
And in fact, just about 10 days, maybe two weeks ago,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.759
the Lord settled for me our theme for next year.

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.400
And I've already given that information

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.360
to folks who'll be working on the graphic work

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.759
and all of that sort of thing.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.279
And so I have a target date always

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.520
of no later than October 1st to get all of that done

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.959
and just trust the Lord.

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:03.180
And it's amazing how God provides.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.400
God knows everything.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.319
And this book of Hebrews is such a precious book

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.800
and I love the way it begins.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.199
And we'll look at it in just a few moments,

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:15.000
but I really wanna look at chapter two

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.839
to give you our text verse this evening

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.720
and kind of begin our study from there.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.040
We've been dealing here on Wednesday evenings

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.720
with this thought, doing what we ought to do.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.120
And I said this and I've said it many times,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.360
this is the ninth lesson on this particular series.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.919
And as I started the series and multiple times

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:36.400
throughout the last nine weeks,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.099
I've made the statement that just because we know

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.199
what we ought to do doesn't mean we do what we ought to do.

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:45.680
And that's one thing to know what we ought to do.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.480
It's another thing to do what we ought to do.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.160
And so I've titled this series, doing what we ought to do.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.360
And God gives us in his word a number of things

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.599
in the New Testament in particular

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.220
of things that we ought to do.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.879
And he uses that terminology.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.120
We find here in Hebrews chapter two,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.639
that the Bible begins and it says,

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.479
therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.580
to the things which we have heard,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.639
lest at any time we should let them slip.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.660
It says in verse number two,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.619
for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.179
and every transgression and disobedience

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.940
received a just recompense of reward,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.479
how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.580
which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.360
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.580
God also bearing them witnessed both with signs and wonders

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.899
and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.300
according to his own will.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.020
You'll notice as I began reading here

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.740
in Hebrews chapter number two,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.100
that you begin reading this text of scripture

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.820
and you notice immediately that the chapter begins

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.979
with that word, therefore.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.199
And every time you see the word, therefore,

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.440
you need to understand the context

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.539
and understand what has previously been given.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.539
The old preacher of yesteryear said,

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.380
when you see therefore,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.619
you gotta find out what it's therefore.

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:14.220
And that's a simple reminder for you and for me.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.259
Every time we come across that word in our Bibles,

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.539
that we have to be aware of what is the context

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.899
immediately proceeding because it has great influence

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.979
on what is getting ready to be said.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.619
And we find that here as it would be necessary for us

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.500
to understand the truth given in chapter number one,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.820
prior to really trying to grasp the instruction

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.820
that will serve as our text for this evening.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820
We come to chapter two and verse number one

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820
and we see that we ought to do something,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.080
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.619
to the things which we have heard.

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.539
I've titled the message this evening,

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.660
if you're taking notes, we ought to listen up.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.399
You ever hear somebody say, listen up?

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.380
Listen to me, listen up, right?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.820
You've heard somebody say that.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.779
And what is it that they're using that terminology for?

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.580
They're trying to get your attention.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.160
They wanna make sure that you're paying attention, why?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.419
Well, they believe as the individual speaking

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.380
that what they're going to say

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.779
has some level of significance or importance.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.579
And therefore they say, listen up.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.619
Sometimes you might hear somebody say this,

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:25.100
are you listening to me?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.899
And you'll hear, hey, listen, listen, listen,

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.779
I'm trying to give you something, listen,

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.260
follow the instructions.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.140
Sometimes we have vacation Bible school,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.700
we're gonna go play a game outside

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.339
and we get all the kids out there

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.820
and they see the things that are set up for the game time.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.899
And I begin to try to explain the game,

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.700
but you've already lost half of them

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:45.380
because they're trying to figure it out on their own

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.540
and they're already trying to go and listen, listen, listen.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.859
And I'll say something like that.

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:52.500
And I have a louder voice than all of them combined

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.980
and I can get their attention.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.459
And the reality is that when we understand,

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.239
if I boil it down to a single statement,

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:04.540
when it says that we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.579
to the things which we have heard, that's a long title.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.700
So I've tried to make it a brief statement,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.440
we ought to listen up.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.920
We find that again, it begins with the word therefore,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.559
so we have to understand the context of chapter number one.

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:22.760
In fact, as we think about the book of Hebrews overall,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.679
there is a recurring theme in the book of Hebrews.

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.459
And the recurring theme in the book of Hebrews

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:31.399
is that Christ is superior.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.540
You say superior to what?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.559
To everything, to everything.

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.700
In chapter number one specifically,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.000
beginning in verse number five

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.519
through the end of the chapter,

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:42.119
the Bible is speaking about

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:45.959
how Christ is superior to angels.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.519
And we find that the information is given,

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:50.239
we're not gonna study that,

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.980
but I do want you to go back to the beginning,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.559
opening statements of Hebrews chapter number one.

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:58.160
It's very amazing to me the way

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.760
that the book of Hebrews begins,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.040
many times in the New Testament writings,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.959
when you think about the letters, the epistles,

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:08.160
the church epistles, the pastoral epistles and all of that,

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.839
you begin to read them with some type of an introduction.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.359
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.880
to so on and so forth,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.739
Jude, a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:23.239
James, and we begin to read many of the epistles that way.

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:27.119
But notice the Bible in Hebrews one says God.

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.880
There is zero introduction as to who the human penman is.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.040
There is no niceties, if you will,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.279
of like greetings and salutations and all of,

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.640
no, it's just God who at sundry times,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.000
notice, and in diverse manners,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.700
I mean, talk about getting rolling right away.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.440
I mean, the Lord, as we find all scriptures

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.540
given by inspiration of God,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.779
that God immediately, as he's writing to these Jewish people

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.959
that have been saved by the grace of God,

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.519
but that are facing great levels of pressure

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.760
to return to Judaism.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.480
And we find that what God is doing in the book of Hebrews

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.559
is saying, listen, Christ is superior.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:17.239
Christ is better.

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:20.959
The Old Testament truth of Judaism

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.720
and all of the sacrifices and all of that,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.640
it's all a picture, a shadow of good things to come.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.119
It's fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:31.959
and Christ is better.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.559
He is superior.

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:35.359
And so we find that he begins

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:37.519
and he begins talking about the way

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:42.519
that God revealed his message to his people in old times

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.440
during the Old Testament period.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.799
Notice he says that God who at sundry times

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.339
and in diverse manners,

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:52.079
that God would often speak to his people,

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:55.519
that God would often deliver a message to his people.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.220
We understand that God used Moses

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.519
and delivered a message to the people

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.940
many times during that period of his leadership

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.660
for the nation of Israel, how God would use Moses.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.459
How many times that Moses stood before God

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:11.420
and said, thus sayeth the Lord.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.019
God would speak to Moses and give Moses a message.

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.540
And Moses was faithful to take that message

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.260
and deliver it to the people.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.019
We find that Joshua delivered messages to the people.

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:23.700
We could look at the judges

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.700
and we could see how God began to use prophets.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.019
And you begin to understand Samuel

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.380
and how God used Samuel.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.859
What about David and how God used David?

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:34.580
You think about the prophets

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.059
and so many prophets that God used.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.380
And he spoke to them.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.539
Notice at the end of verse number one,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.619
in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets.

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:49.460
And so we understand the context of what's going on.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.619
And we can see clearly that the Old Testament scriptures

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:57.219
are what is being referred to in verse number one.

00:08:57.219 --> 00:08:58.380
By the way, I'm thankful

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.080
to have the Old Testament scriptures.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.539
I'm thankful that God in his providence

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.619
chose to preserve for us as New Testament believers,

00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:09.099
the Old Testament scriptures,

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:12.380
because they help us to understand the new.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.539
They're given to us for our admonition,

00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:18.059
for our learning, and we see that truth.

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.679
And there's so many things

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:23.059
that you do not fully comprehend in the New Testament,

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:25.659
apart from having the Old Testament.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:30.460
And it's so precious to think about the Bible as a whole

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.859
and how important it is.

00:09:32.219 --> 00:09:34.700
But then notice in verse number two,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.179
hath in these last days.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.820
Now, we see the reference to the terminology of last days.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.559
In fact, in a couple of weeks,

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:45.340
when we get to 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.979
the Bible will begin talking about in the last days.

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:50.299
Perilous times shall come and so on and so forth.

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:51.820
And we'll look at all of that.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.299
And oftentimes, we use that terminology here.

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:57.979
He's really speaking about the time, if you will,

00:09:57.979 --> 00:10:00.260
between the first and second coming.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.560
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.060
And we begin to see how he's using that time

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.580
and referring to it as last days.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.260
Notice where he says, spoken, hath in these last days,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.260
spoken unto us by his Son.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.700
Now, there's not a period there, there's a comment,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.860
and I'm gonna read the rest of it in just a moment,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.500
but I want you to consider with me just for a moment

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.700
how that God, of course we understand the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.000
God in flesh, he came to the earth

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.780
so that he could die in our place,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.120
and how important that is to understand the purpose,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.540
but we understand that when Jesus was here on earth,

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.000
literally, many of these that are being written to,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.400
they heard the spoken words of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.480
God in flesh.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.960
Remember, during his earthly ministry,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.280
there were many people that flocked to him

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.320
to hear his teaching, why?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.800
Well, the Bible tells us on more than one occasion

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.280
that he taught as one having authority.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.800
He taught, his message, his teaching was different

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.440
than that of the scribes.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.200
His message was a message of authority.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.080
They say, where has he learned this?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.760
He's God, he's God.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.620
We find that even as we begin to think about the miracle

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.520
of the man that was brought,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.800
the man that was sick of the palsy that was born afore,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.320
how that they could not get into the house, why?

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.160
Because there were so many people in Capernaum

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.920
that heard that Jesus was in the house,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.980
that they thronged the house.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.480
They come to that place

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.120
because they want to hear the message.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.660
Jesus spoke many things.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.560
We do not have in written form,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.840
God did not choose to keep in the canon of scripture

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.360
every word that Jesus spoke or every work that Jesus did.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.360
In fact, John concludes the gospel of John

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.260
by saying if all of the things were written

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.520
that the world itself could not contain the volumes

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.280
or the books that would be written.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.680
And you think about the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.760
you can think about his words,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.760
and he spoke the power of his word.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.800
And you remember when they came into the garden

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.000
as Judas would betray him, and he said, who do you seek?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.400
And they said, Jesus.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.960
And he said, I am.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.800
What do they do?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.720
They fell back as, I mean, the power of his word,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.320
the authority of his word.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.200
And here the Bible says in Hebrews one,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.600
again, it's all important to understand

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.240
the context of chapter two,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.760
the text of what we're dealing with this evening.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.460
But it says that God spoken this way in times past,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.360
but in these last days, he has spoken unto us by his son,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.440
notice, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.120
by whom also he made the worlds,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.440
who, being the brightness of his glory

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.360
and express image of his person,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.080
and upholding all things by the word of his power,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.560
when he had by himself purged our sins,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.200
sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.040
Wow.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.640
Those are a few verses of scripture

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.120
that just absolutely exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.760
And we find that the book begins that way.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.480
Verse four, being made so much better than the angels,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.560
as he hath by inheritance obtained

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.680
a more excellent name than they.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.840
Again, in chapter number one,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.540
as far as Christ being superior or better,

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.200
it's then the angels.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.020
And we find that the thought will be recurring

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.360
through the book of Hebrews.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.920
But as we begin to notice this powerful introduction

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.200
to the book of Hebrews, and then pay close attention

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.440
to how this powerful introduction of the book of Hebrews

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.880
relates to the instruction that we've received tonight

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.600
from chapter number two,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.080
therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.140
to the things which we have heard,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.880
notice, lest at any time we should let them slip.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.279
What a piece of instruction that God gives to his people.

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:20.000
Listen up, listen up.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.839
We ought to listen up.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.839
Notice with me, and we're probably gonna end up

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.440
doing this in two parts.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.279
I was struggling with it all afternoon,

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:28.200
whether we'd get through it.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.080
And I don't wanna rush tonight.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.559
And I got a bunch of scriptures that I wanna look at.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:34.400
And so we'll just end when we need to end

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.440
and we'll continue if we need to continue.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.500
And so you just keep in mind

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.740
that we may not finish the whole lesson this evening.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.080
But if you're taking notes,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.000
I want you to first recognize the danger.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.279
It's important that we acknowledge

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.800
here in this text of scripture

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.760
that there is a danger of not hearing

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.160
or listening to the word of God.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.980
There's a danger that we are faced with.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.180
That's why the scriptures instruct us

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.000
that we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which we have heard,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.760
lest at any time we should let them slip.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.559
Notice he mentions in verse number three

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:12.940
about how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.760
which at the first began to be spoken of by the Lord

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.920
and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.600
You think about the continuation of the apostolic ministry

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.800
and the apostles in the first century

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.960
and how they were instrumental

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.200
on laying the foundation for the church

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.860
and how God used them.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.680
And of course, Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680
and they would lay the foundation for the church.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.480
And so we find that there is a danger

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.800
of not hearing the word.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.520
Now, the understanding of this idea

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.640
of giving the more earnest heed

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.600
to the things which we have heard,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.119
it's not really in the sense

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:55.960
in which we sometimes use the word hear or heard or hearing.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.760
It really carries with it the idea

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.880
of hearing, giving earnest heed to something,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.520
to have the intent of obeying.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.480
It's really the idea of the word hear.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.920
It's not the idea of, yeah, I heard him.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.160
Remember the book of James says

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.920
that we're to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.720
And the reality is that the word hear,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.839
both in the Hebrew and in the Greek,

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.540
so in your Old Testament and in your New Testament,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.040
the idea repeatedly of the word hear

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.600
is with the purpose or the intent of obeying.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.480
It's the idea of the word.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.000
Think about when Samuel was instructed by Eli

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.920
after he'd gone to him several times

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.559
and thought that Eli was calling him.

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:45.960
And he says, no, he perceived that it was the Lord

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.320
that was calling Samuel.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.360
And here's the instruction that Eli gives to Samuel.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.360
Say this, speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.520
It wasn't just that he was hearing something

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.320
for the purpose of hearing it.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.480
It was hearing it for the purpose of obeying it.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.160
And so we find here this evening

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.440
when he talks about giving the more earnest heed

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.119
to the things which we have heard,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.880
we find that there's a danger

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.320
that we must acknowledge or recognize this evening.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.200
There's a danger of neglecting personal Bible reading.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.600
There's a danger that we can skim through

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.600
and quickly just not really get what God has for us

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.920
or just totally neglect it.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.360
The studies, the surveys have been given,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.080
the statistics of those that read

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.680
and those that do not read.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.000
I mean, people that profess to be saved people

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.600
that have never read the entire Bible

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.800
from Genesis to Revelation in their entire Christian life.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.200
I've said this before.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.160
There are some, and it was very popular

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.000
probably 10 or 15 years ago,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.559
that they would give and peddle this idea

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.080
that every day just read a Psalm and a Proverb.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.360
And I'm gonna tell you this evening

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.040
that you need a whole lot more than a Psalm and a Proverb.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.839
I am so thankful for the book of Psalms

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.800
and I'm so thankful for the book of Proverbs.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.940
And there have been times in my Christian life

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.480
that I have read the Bible through during the year

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.279
and I have read the book of Psalms

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:21.279
and the book of Proverbs every month of the year.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:23.080
Because the book of Psalms and the book of Proverbs

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
are helpful books.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.140
They're encouraging.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.080
The book of Psalms is encouraging.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.320
You said you read it every month?

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.640
Yeah, you read five Psalms a day

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.740
and you get through it in a month.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.859
You read one Proverb a day, you get through it in a month.

00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:34.640
You say, what do you do when you get to Psalm 119?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.320
You schedule more time.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.700
It just is what it is.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:41.619
And the reality is that I don't do that every year.

00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:43.320
Psalms and Proverbs are important,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.760
but you know, God gave us 64 other books

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.119
that make up the whole of the Bible.

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:52.479
And so we find that there's this danger

00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:54.799
not only of neglecting personal Bible reading,

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.660
but missing preaching services.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.979
The reality is that the preacher has a great responsibility.

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:04.940
The pastor has a God-given responsibility

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.059
to feed the flock of God.

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:10.040
That is a job.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.580
Think about the apostles.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.080
Think about the early church in the book of Acts

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.000
when there was the division and contention

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.619
between the widows that arose.

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:21.179
And they said, it's not that we should leave

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:23.780
prayer and the word, the ministry of the word,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.619
to serve tables.

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:28.619
It's not that they were above serving tables.

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:31.340
It was that they could not neglect the ministry

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.780
of the word and prayer in order to serve tables.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.020
It's an important understanding.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.020
It's a biblical truth and a biblical principle.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.600
And the pastor has the God-given responsibility

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.540
to feed the flock of God,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.260
to give the truth of God's word.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.260
It's not just a performance.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.260
It's not just a fill up some time and get a schedule

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.140
or an event on the calendar.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.340
No, it's giving the Bible the word of God.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.220
God.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.460
Our enemy doesn't want us to hear truth.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.000
He wants you to neglect your Bible reading.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.560
He wants you to miss church services where you could hear the preaching of God's Word.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.620
He wants to keep you from hearing.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.100
He wants to distract you so that even while you're here physically, you're not here mentally.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.940
Have you ever been somewhere but you're not really there?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.940
You say, what do you mean by that?

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.660
You know what I mean by that.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.180
You can be somewhere physically present, but you're checked out.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.700
You're really somewhere else.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.580
And it's all too common.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:44.100
It's all too easy in a society in which we're living today with so many distractions that

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.100
are abounding.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.260
I want you to turn your Bibles, if you will, back to the book of Amos in chapter number

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:58.540
eight, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Amos chapter number eight.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:05.420
And I want you to notice with me what God says in the book of Amos with regard to a

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.420
famine.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.580
Now many times we think about a famine.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.460
We think about a famine that would impact us physically.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:17.540
We think about the situation where you could read about the famine that was faced with

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:22.180
Abraham when he first got to the place where God led him to and he ends up going to Egypt

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.300
because there was a famine in the land.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.660
We think about the famine during the time of Joseph and many other times in the scriptures

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:35.500
that you read of a famine where it would be a famine of nourishment, of sustenance that

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.020
someone could receive physically.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.500
Here Amos is not talking about that type of a famine.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.060
In fact, the Bible makes it very clear in verse number 11 of Amos chapter eight.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.300
The Bible says, behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.300
the land.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:58.500
Not a famine of bread nor thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.380
Now in a very real sense, during Amos' ministry and during his time of prophecy, we find that

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:12.220
Israel was on a very slippery slope facing impending Assyrian captivity, followed of

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.420
course by the Babylonian captivity of Judah and all that was taking place and God says

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.060
that he was going to send.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:25.700
You know, sometimes we refer to the silent years, the 400 years where there was no revelation

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.460
from God.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:33.940
I think about the truth of the proverb that says, where there is no vision, the people

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.140
perish.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.860
I've heard countless people take that verse out of context and they have the idea that

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.980
where there is no vision, the people perish.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.700
In other words, we need a vision for how we're going to reach our community, kind of like

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.660
a vision that a CEO might have or that a pastor might cast a vision and we try to

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.260
have vision Sunday and that kind of an idea with what our theme will be and what have

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.260
you.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.700
That is not what the verse means.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.740
The verse means when there is no vision, there's no prophetic revelation.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.780
God is not speaking, the people perish.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.320
And it says here that the famine was not going to be a famine of bread or water, but of hearing

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.320
the Word of God.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.000
I want you to understand that they, the people of Israel, the people of Judah, they had already

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.780
started ignoring the Word of God, not hearing, not heeding the Word of God.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.360
It was not a matter that the scripture was not available.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.640
It was not the fact that the preacher wasn't preaching, that there weren't prophets.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.600
Now we understand there were false prophets and there are false teachers today, but understand

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.440
with me this evening that there were faithful prophets in the Old Testament.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.240
There were men of old that stood up and faithfully proclaimed and delivered a message to the

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.040
people of God from God.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.840
And there are false teachers that abound today in our society, but I want to remind each

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.600
of us that there are faithful preachers today that are faithfully preaching and heralding

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.160
and teaching the precious Word of God.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.000
We were in a meeting yesterday morning and I had the opportunity to meet probably 40

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.120
preachers, probably 35 of them, I had never met them before, and I got to just very briefly

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120
meet them.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.760
You can't meet everyone and learn everything about everyone in a meeting like that with

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.120
that number of folks, but it was just a preacher's fellowship and it was exciting to hear how

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:40.000
those fellows, those preachers, they were faithfully carrying out the work of God in

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.680
the local area that God had called them to.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:48.280
It was exciting because there are faithful preachers of God's Word.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.040
It wasn't an issue that the Word of God wasn't available.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.840
It wasn't an issue that there were not some faithful preachers.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:01.360
The reality is that there was a part of the hearer that they just were not hearing the

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.800
Word of God.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.120
Notice with me in Deuteronomy, if you will, I want you to turn back to Deuteronomy chapter

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120
one.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.480
We're going to look at a few verses of Scripture in Deuteronomy chapter number one.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.760
Notice as we look at this text of Scripture, of course, Deuteronomy is giving us a recount,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.480
if you will, a rehearsal of all the law and all that's been given and the journeying and

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.680
what have you.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.680
In Deuteronomy chapter one, in verse number 42, notice the Bible says, and the Lord said

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.920
unto me, say unto them.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.040
Now I want you to just pause there for a moment because we can read so quickly through things

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.720
like this, but it says, the Lord said unto me, say unto them.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.400
God gave me a message to give you.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.920
That's what Moses is saying.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:50.720
Now the context here is after the spies came back and the spies came back and said, we're

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.920
not able, they have giants and they have walled cities and we cannot, and God said, okay,

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
that's fine.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.760
Joshua and Caleb, they rent their clothes and they're contending and they're saying,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.200
God is able, but the people said, let us go back to Egypt.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.080
And then the judgment of God was announced.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.720
You read numbers 14 and you can read how the judgment of God was announced.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720
So guess what?

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.000
They say, okay, then we're going to go.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.840
That's what they say.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.200
And God said, I'm not going to go with you because you disobeyed.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.880
And if you go, I'm not going with you and you're going to lose.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880
You're going to be defeated.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.640
That's what God said.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.920
And they tried to go anyway.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.960
And so this is what Moses is rehearsing in Deuteronomy 1.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.960
God said to me, the Lord said unto me, verse 42, saying to them, go not up, neither fight,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.280
for I am not among you, lest you be smitten before your enemies.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.440
Notice the first words of verse 43.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.600
So I spake unto you.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.840
You know how many times I've written in my Bible next to, in the Pentateuch, reading

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.880
the books of the ministry of Moses, how many times I've written in my Bible, he was a faithful

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.880
minister.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.240
He was faithful.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.920
He gave the message that God told him to give.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.540
He was faithful.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.640
He could not control the response of the people, whether they would take heed or disregard,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.600
but he was faithful to give it notice.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:27.320
So I spake unto you, and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.720
Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.120
And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you and chased you as bees

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120
do.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.120
And what does it say?

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:44.020
Destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.240
Notice in verse 43, you would not hear, but you rebelled.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.700
Notice if you will, in 2 Kings, by the way, there's scores of verses of Scripture that

00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.460
I could take you to this evening to give you this truth from the Old Testament, but notice

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.900
2 Kings chapter 17.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.500
I've just picked three this evening to just kind of hammer the thought down.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:16.140
In 2 Kings chapter 17, pick it up reading with me, if you will, in verse number 13,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.580
it said, yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.580
How did he do it?

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.260
Remember Hebrews 1, sundry times, divers manners.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:33.380
Here it says in verse 13 that the Lord testified against Israel, so it was God speaking, but

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.460
who did he use against Israel, against Judah?

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.020
By all the prophets and by all the Seirs.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.580
And what was the message?

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.540
Notice turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.180
to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by my servants, the

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.180
prophets.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:29:00.460
Notice verse 14, notwithstanding, they would not hear, but what do they do?

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.900
They harden their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:11.420
Lord their God.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.940
Notice it says in verse 15, they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.660
with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.580
vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were around about them concerning

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.420
whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.980
It says in verse 16 that they left all the commandments of the Lord.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.100
I can't take time to read all of it, but notice the Bible says in verse 18 that the Lord was

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.500
very angry with Israel.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.300
It says in verse number 23, the last phrase of the verse, so was Israel carried away out

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:52.900
of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.260
The Assyrian captivity is what's captured here.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.020
God was faithful to deliver the message.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.220
He used prophets and he used seers, but the

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.220
The problem was that they would not hear.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.100
It wasn't that the message wasn't made known.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.440
It wasn't that they didn't know what God was saying.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.200
It was that they chose not to obey it.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.640
Notice in the book of Jeremiah, if you will quickly,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.440
Jeremiah chapter 29.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.180
In Jeremiah chapter 29, this evening,

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.740
we see in verse number 19, of course,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.620
Jeremiah is now prophesying.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.480
Assyria has already taken Israel captive.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.580
You gotta fast forward a hundred years,

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.180
a hundred, more than a hundred years, really,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.320
and 115 years or so, and you're on the eve

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.220
of the Babylonian captivity, and Jeremiah's prophesying.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.320
He can see they've laid siege against the city,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.300
and you can understand that this indictment is coming.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.000
And in Jeremiah 29, I want you to notice

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.760
the Bible says this in verse number 19.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.680
It says, because they have not hearkened to my word,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.780
saith the Lord, which I sent unto them by my servants,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.620
the prophets, rising up early and sending them,

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.620
but ye would not hear, saith the Lord.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.760
So then notice verse 20, though.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.720
Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.860
all ye of the captivity whom I have sent

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.800
from Jerusalem to Babylon.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.600
And so God wants his people to hear.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.000
He wants us to listen up.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.360
He wants us to obey, to take heed to his word.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.280
He's not giving us his word to just fill up paper.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.580
He's not giving us his word to fill up time.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.480
He's giving us his word because he wants us to be informed.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.840
He wants us to be instructed.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.320
He wants us to know what to do so that we could please him,

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.660
honor him, and glorify him.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.240
The problem for so many is that we're not really hearing,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.160
not really listening with the purpose of obeying.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.500
So often you'll hear people say something

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.000
like what they say in the Old Testament,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.900
and we'll look at some of that next week,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.840
where the truth of God's word is given,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.640
and the response will be, well, that's just your opinion.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.320
Well, that's a different time.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.360
That's a different era.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.720
That's a different, listen, God's word

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.440
is not only cross-cultural, it covers every culture,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.320
but it's also beyond the bounds of time.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.520
It's a timeless book.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.480
It's a relevant book today.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.360
There are people today that try to charge

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.920
against God's word that it needs to be updated.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.360
It's no longer relevant.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.120
Listen, God's word is as relevant today

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.020
as it was the day it was given.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.120
You know why that's the case?

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.120
Because God, who is the author, he is outside of time,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.960
and he gave us his word.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.820
In the book of Hebrews, in chapter number two,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.280
as we begin studying this instruction,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.980
he says, listen, we need to give,

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.900
we ought to give the more earnest heed

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.000
to the things which we have heard.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.860
Next week, if the Lord allows us,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.780
we'll continue with this thought,

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.220
and we'll deal with, we, tonight, recognize the danger.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.540
Look, there's a danger of not hearing the word of the Lord.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.640
We see the examples.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.180
I could give you more and more examples this evening

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.260
from the Old Testament of those that did not hear,

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.340
even from the New Testament of those that did not hear.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.300
They didn't obey.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.980
Next week, we're gonna deal with this idea

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.500
of how do we learn to listen?

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.500
How do we develop a plan to be able to be in a position

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.820
where we're hearing purpose to obey the word of the Lord?

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.900
Because there's so many things against us.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.840
The enemy does not want us to rehearse

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.340
what I said a moment ago by way of introduction.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.420
The enemy doesn't want you to hear the word.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.220
He doesn't want you to obey the word.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.100
And we need to have a plan.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.860
We need to learn how to listen.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.860
Mentioned on Sunday night about Elijah,

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.120
he heard the word of the Lord.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.620
He heard the word of the Lord.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.060
It was a still, small voice.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.060
And for a few moments on Sunday evening,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.780
I mentioned how important it is

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.540
that we learn to hear the voice of God.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.580
I don't know if it's ever happened to you.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.940
I'll be honest with you tonight.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.860
It's happened to me that I've read a chapter,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.260
sometimes multiple chapters in God's word,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.000
and I pause, and if I'm honest with you tonight,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.280
as I have been before God, I have no idea what I just read.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.980
You say, oh, I'm just being honest.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.680
You know why?

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.540
Because there's distractions.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.300
Other things going on.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.860
You know what I do when that happens?

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.660
I go back and I start over.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.380
Because God has something for us.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.620
God has something for us.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.100
It's his word.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.460
I don't wanna read the Bible to just check a box

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.220
that I did my Bible reading today.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.060
No, no, no, no.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.460
It's not religious activity.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.300
It's not rote religion.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.180
This book is God's word to me, to you.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.580
It's not just a religious exercise.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.100
It's hearing from the God of the universe.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.940
What a joy.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.380
But we've all been in the position

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.740
where if someone were to quiz you and say,

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.140
hey, what did you read from your Bible?

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.420
I know I read my Bible today, but man.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860
We gotta have a plan.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.780
We'll deal with that next week.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.620
Lord, we love you.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.620
We thank you for loving us.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.460
Thank you for your word, how precious it is.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.180
God, we're thankful that all scripture

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.260
is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.180
God, we believe that tonight.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.300
God, I pray that you'd help us to do

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.540
as the scriptures instruct us to do.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.740
We ought to listen up, give the more earnest heed.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.860
Lord, I pray that you would bless our time of prayer.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.020
We thank you for the privilege.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.300
Pray that you'd be honored and glorified

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.740
for it's in Christ and we pray, amen.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.540
Anyone need a prayer bulletin tonight?
