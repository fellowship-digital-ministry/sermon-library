1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,799
your last name publicly,

2
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,359
but it's certainly good to see you this morning.

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,880
We're thankful that you could be here.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,920
And then Juliana and Evan are here this morning as well,

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,279
and they're doing well.

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,279
Juliana's struggling with some morning sickness,

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,399
but that's to be expected.

8
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:14,479
And it's good to have them.

9
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,459
They'll be traveling back this afternoon

10
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,159
and thankful for the visit

11
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,639
that we've been able to have this weekend.

12
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:21,360
We'll get to Psalm 12, six and seven,

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,639
but after they sang that song,

14
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,600
I thought we should start here in 1 Peter 1.

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,280
And verse number 23 says this,

16
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,360
"'Being born again, not of corruptible seed,

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,000
but of incorruptible,

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,840
by the Word of God which liveth

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,520
and abideth forever.

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,319
For all flesh is as grass

21
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,639
and all the glory of man

22
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,279
is the flower of grass.

23
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,400
The grass withereth

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,439
and the flower thereof falleth away,

25
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,759
but the Word of the Lord

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,720
endureth forever.'"

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
And this is the Word,

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,319
which by the Gospel is preached unto you.

29
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:01,720
This morning, we're gonna look at this subject,

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,199
Preservation Reveals the Greatness of God.

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,959
Our theme for 2023,

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,879
Great is the Lord and Greatly to be Praised.

33
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,919
And our God is great,

34
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,199
and I'm so thankful that He's revealed to us

35
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,400
through the pages of Scripture

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,239
that He's a great God.

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,199
I'm thankful that the psalmist said this,

38
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,879
I know that the Lord is great.

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,599
And I hope this morning that each of us,

40
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,879
as we've entered into this worship service,

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,480
that we would agree with the psalmist

42
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,639
and we would say, I know that the Lord is great.

43
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:31,919
But then the psalmist says this,

44
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,000
and there's no contradiction in what he says,

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,360
he says this, that His greatness,

46
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,720
God's greatness is unsearchable

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,160
because the reality is as great as you think

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
that God is today, He's greater.

49
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,440
As great as you think He is tomorrow,

50
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,400
as your understanding of God's greatness

51
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,519
will increase as you walk with God,

52
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,639
He's greater.

53
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,199
He's greater still.

54
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,680
And the psalmist comes to this great declaration

55
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,680
and he says this, I will declare thy greatness.

56
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,639
And that's where each of us need to be in our lives,

57
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,080
that we understand that God is great,

58
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,319
but then we declare His greatness.

59
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,320
We look at the fact that creation reveals

60
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,600
the greatness of God.

61
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,119
I'm so thankful that God said, and it was so.

62
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,160
I'm thankful that the Bible reveals to us

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,559
and records for us the origin of man,

64
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,759
the origin of the universe.

65
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,919
And God tells us that He is the creator.

66
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,240
He tells us how He did it.

67
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,039
What a blessing to understand the truth of creation

68
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,800
and then to understand that the creator God is my helper.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,839
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

70
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,080
from whence cometh my help.

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,520
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,440
And what a joy to know that the creator God is my helper.

73
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
He's your helper.

74
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,759
And we can go to Him understanding that He is able

75
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,199
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

76
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Last week, we looked at the truth of inspiration.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,440
Inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

78
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,160
And what a blessing to understand how God gave us His word.

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,240
We said this last week,

80
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,679
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

81
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,559
The Bible is the best-selling book of all time.

82
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,960
It's the most translated book of all time.

83
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,199
And we are so blessed this morning to have the Bible.

84
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,119
We asked this question and we answered it last week,

85
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,320
and we'll reference it again this morning.

86
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,000
What is it about the Bible that sets it apart

87
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:22,679
from every other book?

88
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,039
What is it about this book that makes it

89
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,600
the greatest book of all time?

90
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,240
What is it that makes it the best-selling

91
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,919
and most translated book?

92
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,039
We understand this, that God, who alone is great,

93
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,000
is the author of this book.

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It is God's word.

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,320
It is not man's word.

96
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,279
It is God's word.

97
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:43,559
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

98
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,720
We dealt with that last week.

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,759
And I'm so thankful for the truth of inspiration.

100
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,639
But the reality is that inspiration without preservation

101
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,559
is great for the original recipients.

102
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,559
But there's not one of us that are the original recipients.

103
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,000
So I'm thankful this morning for the truth of preservation.

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,199
The word preservation means this,

105
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,479
the providential keeping of the original text

106
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,239
from loss or alteration.

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
And I'm thankful that as you think about

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
that definition of preservation,

109
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,799
that we have this morning the word of God.

110
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,519
And we can have confidence in what we hold

111
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,839
in our hands this morning that this is God's word,

112
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,000
that God is the one that has promised

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,040
to providentially keep His word.

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
And we understand this morning,

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
even as we read this text of scripture

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
in 1 Peter chapter number one,

117
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,880
that we're born again not of corruptible seed

118
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
but of incorruptible.

119
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,880
By the word of God which liveth and abideth forever.

120
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,079
How is it that you were aware of the fact

121
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,119
that you were a sinner in need of a Savior?

122
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,000
How was it that you were aware of the fact

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that God is gracious and He's merciful

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,799
and He loves you and He died for you

125
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,519
and He was buried and He rose again

126
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,399
and He offers eternal life?

127
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,799
You know those truths because of this book.

128
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,600
And it's been preserved for us this morning.

129
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
How do we know?

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,640
We sing songs, we're singing this morning

131
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,399
and you begin to think about the future

132
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,839
of the child of God, the hope that we have

133
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,839
and the return of the Lord and the truth of eternity.

134
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,559
How is it, what is it that gives us that hope,

135
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,559
that confidence, it's this book

136
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,079
that's been preserved for us this morning.

137
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,079
I believe that preservation reveals the greatness of God.

138
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm thankful that He gave it by inspiration.

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,480
God breathed, but I'm thankful that He's preserved it.

140
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,799
I've heard people say this over the years.

141
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,440
Nowhere in the Bible does God say

142
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,079
that He would preserve His word.

143
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,519
The problem is that they're using the wrong Bible.

144
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Turn over to Psalm 12, it's where we were going

145
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,000
to begin this morning before they sang that song.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
By the way, it was quite interesting.

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
I referenced Anywhere With Jesus

148
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,399
in Sunday school this morning and then we're singing it.

149
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,920
And I had a couple of people come to me and say,

150
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
did you know we were singing that song?

151
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
I had no idea actually.

152
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,559
I don't pick the songs, Dean does,

153
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,720
and we just roll with it.

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,399
I saw the list, but I didn't even look up

155
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,559
the songs this week.

156
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,600
And Anywhere With Jesus, the songwriter said in verse five,

157
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
I can go to sleep.

158
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,239
And we saw Peter sleeping between those soldiers

159
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,519
this morning in Acts chapter number 12.

160
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,399
But look here in Psalm 12 in verses six and seven.

161
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,760
If you're taking notes this morning,

162
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,720
number one, the promise of preservation.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,320
The Bible says this in verse six,

164
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,480
the words of the Lord are pure words.

165
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,040
We mentioned this last week that they're pure words

166
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
because they're God's words.

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,880
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

168
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,640
And because they're God's words, they're pure.

169
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,119
They're without error.

170
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,920
They are trustworthy, they are reliable.

171
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,519
And we can go to the Bible and we can have confidence,

172
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,359
even as the wise man says in Proverbs 30,

173
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,359
the word of the Lord, it's pure.

174
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,359
Every word of God is pure.

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,959
We find here that the Bible says that they are pure words.

176
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,799
Why?

177
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,640
Because they're God's words.

178
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,559
And notice he says as silver tried in a furnace of earth,

179
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,959
purified seven times.

180
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,399
Many of us have no idea about metalworking

181
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,559
and we've never done it.

182
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,959
We're not experienced in metalworking.

183
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,239
Obviously there's some people during the time

184
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,880
of this writing that would have understood

185
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,480
the reference here to silver being tried

186
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,760
in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

187
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,480
For most of us, our only understanding of that

188
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,679
is by looking it up and studying something

189
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,040
about metalworking.

190
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,679
But what I understand, I've never done it personally,

191
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,519
but what I understand through study

192
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,440
is that they would say that the purest silver

193
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,200
you could receive is silver that was tried seven times.

194
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,079
That's how pure this book is.

195
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,000
And notice what he says.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,200
We understand the truth of inspiration,

197
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,920
but when we look at the promise of preservation,

198
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,640
notice in verse number seven,

199
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,640
thou shalt keep them, oh Lord.

200
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,119
Thou shalt, what does it say?

201
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:18,119
Preserve them from this generation forever.

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,959
This promise that we find in Psalm 12 in verse number seven

203
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,359
with regard to the truth of preservation

204
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:29,040
is a precious promise that we hold dear

205
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
and we rejoice in this promise.

206
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,840
And we understand that the Lord himself

207
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,320
has made this promise and let me say this,

208
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,799
God is the only one that could fulfill this promise

209
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,840
because he's the only one that's eternal.

210
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
He's the only one that can say,

211
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,039
I will preserve this word, my word,

212
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,599
from this generation forever because he's the eternal God.

213
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,400
No church can make that claim,

214
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,440
no individual can make that claim,

215
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,359
but God Almighty, the one who's the creator,

216
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,760
the one that spoke everything into existence,

217
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,400
the one who's my redeemer

218
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,039
that they sang about this morning,

219
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,039
he gave us a promise that he would preserve his word

220
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,640
and he said from this generation and forever.

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,919
I'm thankful that we still fall

222
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,359
within the category of this generation forever, amen?

223
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,320
God is alpha and omega.

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,719
He's the first and the last.

225
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:28,400
He's outside of time, he is the eternal God

226
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
and he's given us this promise this morning

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,440
and we ought to rejoice that God Almighty

228
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,919
has given us a promise

229
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,799
and he alone is able to fulfill that promise.

230
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,520
See, the reality this morning

231
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
is that the promise is only as good as the one who makes it.

232
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
A promise is only as good as the one who makes it.

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,080
You could promise something all day long,

234
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,159
you could promise your kids,

235
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,960
you could promise some other person

236
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,159
and you can make promises,

237
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:59,799
but the reality is that God Almighty made this promise

238
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,640
and he.

239
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
is able to fulfill it.

240
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,580
I would say this morning that he has fulfilled it.

241
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,640
Forever, O Lord, the psalmist said,

242
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,140
thy word is settled in heaven.

243
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,940
Oh, no doubt, and we'll look at some of this next week,

244
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,560
there have been many that have sought to destroy it.

245
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
There have been many that have tried to alter it.

246
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
But remember that definition of preservation

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,560
is the providential keeping of the original text

248
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,040
from loss or alteration.

249
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,920
It's very interesting that this morning

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,920
there's much with regard to the alteration of God's word.

251
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,720
And they seek to change it and what have you,

252
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,360
but we find this morning that God's given us this promise.

253
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,080
Turn to the book of, right here in Psalm, Psalm 119.

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,340
Look over at what the psalmist says.

255
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,600
We'll look at two verses.

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,940
I've already referenced Psalm 119 in verse 89,

257
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,920
where the Bible says, forever, O Lord,

258
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,280
thy word is settled in heaven.

259
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,460
I wanna draw your attention to Psalm 119, 160.

260
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,720
Psalm 119, and look at verse number 160.

261
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,520
Notice what the Bible says.

262
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,000
The psalmist says, thy word is true from the beginning.

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,040
Thy word is true from the beginning.

264
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,240
And then notice, and every one of thy righteous judgments

265
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,520
endureth, how long?

266
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,360
Forever.

267
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,800
So does that mean that this morning in 2023,

268
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,520
can we have confidence in our Bible?

269
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,760
Absolutely.

270
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,000
We can have confidence this morning

271
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,920
that God has fulfilled what he said he would fulfill

272
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
and that his word is going to endure forever

273
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,680
because he gave the promise.

274
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,240
And that oughta cause us to rejoice.

275
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,680
Listen, when we think about the truth of preservation,

276
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,240
look over to the New Testament.

277
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,960
Notice this, Christ declared the truth of preservation.

278
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,940
The Lord Jesus Christ, he declared this truth.

279
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,680
Look in the book of Matthew, if you will,

280
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
in Matthew chapter number four,

281
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,640
we'll look at the several verses of Scripture

282
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,100
through the Gospels and referencing this morning

283
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,640
that the Lord Jesus Christ declared

284
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,720
the truth of preservation.

285
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,640
Here in Matthew chapter number four,

286
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,600
and we know that this is the passage of Scripture,

287
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,760
the Gospel account in Matthew's Gospel

288
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,480
of the temptation of the Lord.

289
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,520
And the Bible says this in verse number four,

290
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,640
but he answered and said, it is written,

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
man shall not live by bread alone,

292
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,880
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

293
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,840
The Lord Jesus Christ made this statement here

294
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,720
during his earthly ministry, during this time of temptation

295
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,880
and we find that he's quoting Deuteronomy chapter eight

296
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,980
in verse number three.

297
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
He's quoting that book that was written

298
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,280
many, many, many, many centuries prior,

299
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,720
but he's quoting it, why?

300
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Because the word of the Lord endureth forever.

301
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,920
God's word, the truth of preservation.

302
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,560
Notice in Matthew 24,

303
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,200
and notice what the Bible says here

304
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,840
is Jesus is giving answers to those

305
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,920
that have asked questions

306
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,220
and he gives us this great truth with regard,

307
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,400
again, to the truth and the teaching of preservation.

308
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,520
In Matthew chapter 24, in verse number 35,

309
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,440
Matthew 24 in verse 35,

310
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,800
the Lord Jesus Christ said,

311
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,960
heaven and earth shall pass away,

312
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,840
but my words, my words shall not pass away.

313
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,180
Heaven and earth shall pass away,

314
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,720
but my words shall not pass away.

315
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,880
In the gospel of Mark,

316
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
Mark records for us in Mark chapter number 12

317
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,280
in verse number 24,

318
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,480
this truth again with regard to preservation.

319
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,840
And it's interesting because in this particular passage

320
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,720
in Mark chapter 12,

321
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,160
I'll give you a moment to turn there

322
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,520
and before I read the verses that I wanna deal with,

323
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,800
we find once again that the Lord Jesus Christ

324
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,060
is being confronted by those that are seeking to attack him

325
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,800
and seeking to trip him up with some teachings

326
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
and what have you.

327
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,660
And we find that the ones that are coming to him

328
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,040
in this particular account are the Sadducees.

329
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,920
Now, something interesting about the Sadducees

330
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
is that they did not believe in the resurrection.

331
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,620
Some Bible scholars have said that's why they're sad,

332
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,740
you see, because they don't believe in the resurrection.

333
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,660
But the reality is that there were several things

334
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,580
they didn't believe in,

335
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,980
but one of them is the resurrection.

336
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,620
It's quite interesting because they come to Jesus.

337
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,580
Now, understand, they don't believe in the resurrection,

338
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,220
but they say in verse number 18,

339
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,660
which say there's no resurrection,

340
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,980
and they asked him saying,

341
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,900
Master, Moses wrote,

342
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,420
and he goes through this whole situation,

343
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,020
and he says in verse 23,

344
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,420
these false teachers, these Sadducees,

345
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,220
they say in the resurrection, therefore,

346
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,380
when they shall rise,

347
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,060
whose wife shall she be of them?

348
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,860
For the seven had heard a wife.

349
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,580
They didn't believe in the resurrection,

350
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,100
but they're trying to catch Jesus in something,

351
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,260
and they're trying to trip him up.

352
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,460
They didn't believe in the resurrection,

353
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,820
but yet they say in the resurrection, therefore,

354
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,260
but notice the answer that Jesus gives.

355
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,540
In verse number 24, Jesus said this,

356
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,940
do ye not therefore err?

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
Why?

358
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,340
Because you know not the scriptures.

359
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,760
Because you know not the scriptures.

360
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,600
What's he referring to?

361
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,440
He's referring to the Old Testament,

362
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,120
to the writings of Moses in which they're referring to,

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,580
and he says you err, why?

364
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,040
Because you do not know the scriptures.

365
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Notice where he says this,

366
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,120
neither the power of God.

367
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
I believe this morning

368
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,080
that there's certainly an understanding

369
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,240
with regard to the truth of preservation

370
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,360
and the promise of preservation of God's power.

371
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,040
No, I believe that God has the power.

372
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,240
He has the ability to preserve his word.

373
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,880
I ask this question of people

374
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,840
that don't believe in preservation.

375
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,480
They don't believe that God has preserved

376
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,040
as he said that he would.

377
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,560
You believe that he's gonna take you to heaven one day,

378
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,160
but you don't believe that he can preserve his word.

379
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,260
That's questionable.

380
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,880
God promised to preserve his word.

381
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,240
The Lord Jesus Christ, during his earthly ministry,

382
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,880
he declared, he referenced the truth of preservation.

383
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
The apostles, they taught the truth of preservation.

384
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,640
We've read already there in 1 Peter 1,

385
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,320
it's where we started this morning,

386
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,920
and we read where Peter,

387
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,560
he talks about the preservation of scripture.

388
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,280
He says in just a couple of verses,

389
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,660
he talks about how it abideth forever.

390
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,640
He says in verse 25 of 1 Peter 1,

391
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,080
but the word of the Lord endureth forever.

392
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,640
He gives the truth in verse number 24,

393
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,360
for all flesh is as grass,

394
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,320
and all the glory of man is the flower of grass.

395
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,300
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof felleth away.

396
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,800
Listen, we see that in life.

397
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,360
We understand that.

398
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Things come and things go,

399
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,640
but we understand this morning that Peter's saying,

400
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,560
but listen, that's not like the Bible.

401
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,520
That's not like the word of God,

402
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,220
because the word of God endureth forever.

403
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,080
I'm so thankful for that.

404
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,680
We read last week about the truth of inspiration,

405
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,920
and Paul made the claim there

406
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,600
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

407
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,720
in 2 Timothy 3,

408
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,400
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

409
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
and is profitable,

410
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,240
but before he said that,

411
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,120
he said to Timothy in verse number 15,

412
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,920
that thou, you've learned these things,

413
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,040
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

414
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,600
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

415
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,280
What are these holy scriptures that he's referring to?

416
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,360
Again, the Old Testament.

417
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
So what are they teaching?

418
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,980
They're teaching this truth of preservation,

419
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
that God's word has been preserved.

420
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,920
It's interesting to me,

421
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,320
in 2 Timothy chapter four,

422
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,400
turn there, if you will,

423
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
in 2 Timothy chapter number four,

424
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,820
Paul is, of course, near the end of his life,

425
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,480
and he's given that great declaration

426
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,080
that he's ready to be offered,

427
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,680
and we're familiar with verses six through eight.

428
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,120
We often reference those,

429
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,880
and Paul coming to the end of his life with no regrets,

430
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,520
understanding that he's finished his course,

431
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,840
he's kept the faith,

432
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,560
and what a joy and what a blessing

433
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,120
to be able to finish in that matter.

434
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,540
But I want you to notice,

435
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,640
as he closes out the text of scripture

436
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,240
in this book to Timothy,

437
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,320
he gives some parting comments

438
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,740
beginning in verse number nine.

439
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,800
I want to draw your attention

440
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,360
specifically to verse number 13

441
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,640
as it's applicable to our message this morning.

442
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
He says this,

443
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus,

444
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,280
when thou comest, bring with thee,

445
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
end the books,

446
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,119
but then notice what he says,

447
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
but especially the parchments.

448
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,640
Do you know what he's referring to

449
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,119
when he says especially the parchments?

450
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,359
He's talking about the Old Testament scriptures,

451
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,160
and he understands the truth of preservation.

452
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,320
He understands the power of the word of God,

453
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
and he says, listen,

454
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,679
there's some things that I want you to bring,

455
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,160
and he talks about a cloak,

456
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
and he talks about the books

457
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
that he references there in verse number 13,

458
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,679
but I love how he uses the phraseology

459
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,200
when he says, but especially the parchments.

460
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
Listen, if you forget the cloak,

461
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,679
if you don't have room for the other books,

462
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,600
don't worry,

463
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,359
just make sure you bring the parchments.

464
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,040
I understand that there's a story

465
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,500
about a missionary in Africa

466
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,799
years and years and years ago,

467
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,920
decades ago,

468
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
and he was going,

469
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,320
and he's going into the jungle,

470
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,160
into the bush,

471
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,720
and it was a very difficult trail,

472
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,119
and it was a difficult journey,

473
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,320
and all of the obstacles that we're facing,

474
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,440
and he had brought with him

475
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,640
a great load of things

476
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,480
that he was planning to use for ministry,

477
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
and along the way,

478
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,799
he realized that it's just not gonna be possible

479
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,000
to take everything that he brought with him.

480
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,500
The load was too large.

481
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,559
So along the way,

482
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,480
he had to choose some things to part with.

483
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,040
The missionary decided,

484
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,720
I don't need these things,

485
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,559
I can do without these,

486
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,119
and as he tried to continually decrease the load,

487
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,960
it just became.

488
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,200
became more and more difficult to make the journey, the trek, with anything.

489
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,040
The one thing that he said he could not part with was this book.

490
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
I can leave all the other books.

491
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,720
I can leave the books that I thought would help me in ministry and what have you, but

492
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,220
I can't part with the Bible.

493
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,320
And Paul, he says, listen, especially the parchments, understanding the truth of preservation

494
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,760
and teaching for us the truth of preservation.

495
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,520
On Wednesday evening, Brother Tim came and asked me some questions down in my office.

496
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,000
We had a good time chatting about preparation of messages and various things, and it was

497
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,920
a real good conversation.

498
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,660
And we're standing there in my office, and there's bookshelves with books.

499
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,680
And I said to him, I said, listen, all of those books have their place, but they cannot

500
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,540
take the place of this book.

501
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,400
I've read a number of the books on my bookshelf.

502
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
There are some that I've recommended for other people to read.

503
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
They've been helpful.

504
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,640
But I told Tim this.

505
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
He can vouch for me.

506
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,840
I said, listen, you read a commentary, a commentary is man's words about God's Word.

507
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
Is that what I told you?

508
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

509
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,920
You better dig in the Word of God.

510
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Get into this book.

511
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Why?

512
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,040
Because it's been preserved for us, and we can rejoice this morning in knowing that God

513
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,640
has given us this promise of preservation.

514
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,200
We must hold dear to this promise and understand that He alone who made the promise is the

515
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,720
only one that can fulfill the promise.

516
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
Now notice with me number two.

517
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,720
We see the promise of preservation, but let me remind you of the process of preservation,

518
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
the process of preservation.

519
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,200
We're not going to get deep into this this morning, but we find that the process of preservation,

520
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,240
again, you find that the definition is the providential keeping of the original text

521
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
from loss or alteration.

522
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,000
There are people today that are saying, well, I want to find the originals.

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,440
If I could get the originals, then I'd believe it.

524
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:12,240
But God promised to preserve, and so I don't need the original if my God promised to preserve

525
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,620
it and He has, and that preservation is the providential keeping, remember, of what?

526
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,480
The original.

527
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,680
From loss or alteration.

528
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:34,980
So if God has promised to preserve His Word, and He has, and God has always fulfilled what

529
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,760
He's promised, I don't need to search for an original.

530
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,720
There's all this conversation that took place and still takes place today about the Dead

531
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,880
Sea Scrolls.

532
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,200
No doubt you've heard about it.

533
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,760
Listen, when God said He was going to preserve His Word, He didn't mean in some cave over

534
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,440
in Israel.

535
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,720
And for 18 centuries of biblical Christianity, they don't have the Bible.

536
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,280
It doesn't even make sense.

537
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,840
God promised to preserve, and He's preserved His Word, and it's a providential, miraculous

538
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,800
work of God.

539
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
How did He do it?

540
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Well, He used His people.

541
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,740
He used His people to carry out the work of preservation.

542
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,160
But I want you to understand that God is the one who has providentially preserved.

543
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,600
Though He would use people, it is God who is the one that's superseding.

544
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,280
It's just like when you understand the truth of inspiration, we say, well, who wrote the

545
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
book?

546
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,440
How many of you ever had that question?

547
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,080
Maybe some of the teens, they won't ask it now, so I'm trying to get some of the hard

548
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,000
questions out of the way for the book of Genesis.

549
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,840
No, I'm just kidding, I won't take any more.

550
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,240
But the reality is that who wrote the book of Genesis?

551
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Who wrote the book of, right, we hear that, right?

552
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,640
But ultimately, that little boy in Sunday school or in junior church that has the same

553
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,440
answer for every question, God, God, you ever met that person that just, that's their answer

554
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
for every question?

555
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,760
Well, the reality is that God did write it.

556
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,440
He's the author of Scripture, but God used man.

557
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:20,120
God used human penmen to write the Word of God, and God has used man to preserve His

558
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Word.

559
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,840
But understand, it's not in some group of men that have preserved it.

560
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,080
It's God that has preserved it using His people.

561
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,960
Does that make sense this morning?

562
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,520
And we must understand that, and we look at this process of preservation.

563
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:49,940
Let's go to the book of Romans, if you will, Romans chapter number 3.

564
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:59,080
In Romans chapter number 3, a question is asked, and we find that there's a great truth

565
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,200
that's revealed to us in answering that question.

566
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,080
In verse number 1, the Bible says this, "'What advantage then hath the Jew, or what profit

567
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,320
is there of circumcision?'

568
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,960
And then notice what he says in verse number 2, "'Much every way, chiefly because that

569
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,080
unto them were committed the oracles of God.'"

570
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,360
That's a reference, another name that God uses for the Word of God, and we find that

571
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,860
God had committed to the Jewish people.

572
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,900
You think about the scribes and what their responsibility was in writing out and giving

573
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:44,100
the copies of God's Word, and you understand how God would use and how God would work through

574
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,180
that process of preservation.

575
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,820
Many times the originals weren't available.

576
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Why?

577
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Because the originals were used.

578
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,020
And once they got to a point where they weren't able to be read or able to be used any longer,

579
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,100
they would be destroyed, but you would have these copies, and the process of copying

580
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:09,140
out these scribes, the process that would follow was very, very specific and very detailed

581
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,620
as to what they would do and how they would do.

582
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,260
You ever write something by hand, and you get down to the bottom, and you make an error,

583
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,860
and you just want to kind of cross it out and keep going, right, because you don't want

584
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,660
to have to start over?

585
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
They weren't allowed to do that.

586
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,660
To make an error, you've got to throw the whole thing away and start over.

587
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,460
They counted every letter.

588
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:38,140
I mean, they were meticulous in their process, but it was God who was supernaturally preserving

589
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
His Word.

590
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,180
I want you to think about this.

591
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,180
The Bible says this in 1 Timothy 3, in verse number 15, that the church is the pillar and

592
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,500
ground of the truth.

593
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,540
And in a very real sense, we find that God has used the church in preserving His Word,

594
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
His people.

595
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Notice over in Matthew chapter 28, a familiar passage of Scripture that each of us would

596
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,980
be familiar with, the Great Commission, in Matthew chapter 28, but we think about the

597
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,740
Great Commission in light of what I just mentioned about 1 Timothy 3 and verse 15, where the

598
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,960
Bible says that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

599
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,400
What is the truth?

600
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
The Bible.

601
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
The Bible.

602
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Thy Word is truth.

603
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,440
Jesus is truth, right?

604
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,400
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

605
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,740
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

606
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,880
He then says this in John 17, sanctify them by Thy Word.

607
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
Thy Word is truth.

608
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,160
And so we find that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth and that God has committed

609
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,800
to us the Word of God, the Bible, and what a blessing it is to have the Bible.

610
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,220
But notice with me this process of preservation.

611
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,960
How is it that God would use His power?

612
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,920
He's obviously, or His people, He's supernaturally overseeing the providential preservation of

613
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
His Word.

614
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,640
But notice in verse 18 of Matthew 28, and Jesus came and spake unto them saying, all

615
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,360
power is given unto Me in heaven and earth.

616
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
We mentioned just a little while ago in the Gospel of Mark where He said you do err not

617
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,480
knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.

618
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,560
He says all power is given unto Me in heaven and earth.

619
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Aren't you thankful that you serve the omnipotent God and that the omnipotent God reigneth?

620
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,080
What a joy and what a blessing to know His power.

621
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,440
Notice the commission in verse 19, go ye therefore and teach all nations.

622
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,080
What are we supposed to teach them?

623
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,700
The Word of God, the Gospel.

624
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,380
Teach all nations, notice what He says, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the

625
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,900
Son and of the Holy Ghost.

626
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,140
So we understand that we give the Gospel, right?

627
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,020
What has to happen before somebody gets baptized?

628
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,679
Well, they've got to be saved, right?

629
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,980
If somebody comes to me and says, Pastor, I want to be baptized, I say, well, talk to

630
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,760
me about when you got saved.

631
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,020
When did you trust Christ as your personal Savior?

632
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,100
Because if you haven't been saved yet, baptism is not yet for you.

633
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,660
Because we believe the Bible plainly teaches that baptism, it's believer's baptism by

634
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,260
immersion.

635
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
And we believe that.

636
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,340
We can go to passages of Scripture.

637
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,820
Remember the Ethiopian eunuch, he says, hey, Philip, there's water.

638
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,260
What doth hinder me to be baptized?

639
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,660
If you believe, you may, right?

640
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,700
So we understand that as I stand in these waters just a couple of weeks ago, had baptism

641
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,420
and I stand here and I say, listen, Ethan, have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as

642
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
your personal Savior?

643
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,980
Do you have assurance that heaven is your home?

644
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,220
He says, yes, I do.

645
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,940
I say this, Ethan, according to your profession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of

646
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,940
the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, right?

647
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,100
And so we understand that salvation, the Gospel has to be preached.

648
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,780
We preach the Gospel.

649
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,220
We give the truth of the death, the peril, and the glorious resurrection of our Savior.

650
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
And then we baptize.

651
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
but notice what it says in verse 20,

652
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,660
teaching them to observe all things

653
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,860
whatsoever I have commanded you.

654
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,340
Teaching who?

655
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,940
Well, the people that got saved and got baptized, right?

656
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,400
If you look at verse 19,

657
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,340
he says that we're to go into all nations,

658
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,440
we're to teach all nations, baptizing them,

659
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,420
and then we're to teach them.

660
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,940
And so we would look at verse number 20

661
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
as being the truth of discipleship.

662
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,900
See, it's not about just seeing people

663
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,940
make professions of faith and just getting them baptized.

664
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,220
We want to see people saved

665
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,620
and we want to see them baptized,

666
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,860
but there's this need for discipleship.

667
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,260
And notice what he says,

668
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,260
teaching them to observe all things

669
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,860
whatsoever I have commanded you.

670
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,820
So if Jesus says to the disciples

671
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,740
that you're to command,

672
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,780
that you're to teach them to obey,

673
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,420
to observe all things that I have commanded you,

674
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,500
then does he, in giving this command,

675
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,400
is there not a reference to preservation?

676
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,900
Because how are we gonna teach all things

677
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,020
if all things are not preserved?

678
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,980
Does that make sense this morning?

679
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,500
And so we find that he says,

680
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,820
and lo, I am with you always,

681
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,660
even under the end of the world.

682
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,680
Bookends, if you will, to this wonderful command

683
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,020
that God has given us.

684
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,100
In verse 18, he's all powerful.

685
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,220
In verse number 20, he's everywhere present.

686
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,580
He says, I've given you all things

687
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,300
and I'm commanding you.

688
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,540
I have all power and I'm commanding you

689
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,260
to teach all these things,

690
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
whatsoever things I've commanded you,

691
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,540
to these that have been saved and baptized.

692
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,300
And by the way, he says, I am with you always,

693
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,100
even under the end of the world.

694
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,940
Amen.

695
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,360
The church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

696
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,800
As the church preaches the gospel,

697
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,120
sees people saved and baptized and discipled,

698
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,300
we see how God is continuing the work of preservation.

699
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,840
We can look over the centuries

700
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,800
and we can see how God has supernaturally,

701
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,440
providentially preserved his word

702
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
through using his people.

703
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,240
Let me finish up number three,

704
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,920
principles of Bible preservation.

705
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,600
We look at the promise, the process,

706
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,280
but then look at some principles.

707
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
I want you to understand this morning

708
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,400
that preservation is linked to the very character of God.

709
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,080
Preservation is linked to the very character of God.

710
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,600
Turn to the book of Psalms again, Psalm 100.

711
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,920
Psalm 100 is a familiar passage of scripture.

712
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,880
In fact, many times we would be able to recite this passage

713
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,360
and what a joy to think about the truth

714
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
that God would contain in just five short verses

715
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,720
of scripture.

716
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
In Psalm 100,

717
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,960
we look at verse number five.

718
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,320
Notice what the Bible says,

719
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,360
for the Lord is good.

720
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,560
Aren't you thankful that we have a good God?

721
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,200
The psalmist had declared earlier,

722
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,400
taste and see that the Lord is good.

723
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,440
He had experienced the goodness of God

724
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,480
and he desired for others to have that same experience,

725
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,080
to have that same understanding that God is good.

726
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,800
By the way, it's his very nature.

727
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,240
God's goodness is not dependent upon your circumstances.

728
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,560
So many people in life have the idea

729
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,840
that when things are going well,

730
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,320
when everything's kind of squared away, so to speak,

731
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,280
then God is good.

732
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,800
But the reality is that God is good all of the time

733
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,880
because it's his nature.

734
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,640
He's a good God.

735
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,200
God is good.

736
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,600
Notice it says this, his mercy is everlasting.

737
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,400
Aren't you thankful for God's mercy?

738
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,360
Ephesians chapter number two says it this way,

739
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,440
but God who is rich in mercy.

740
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,720
I'm thankful for the mercy of God.

741
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,600
His mercy endureth forever.

742
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,760
And we this morning have been the recipients

743
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
of God's mercy.

744
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm thankful that God declares that he is a merciful God.

745
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,720
And it says that he's good.

746
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,320
It says that his mercy is everlasting,

747
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,160
but then notice in verse number five,

748
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,160
and his truth endureth to all generations.

749
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,600
Listen, the same verse of scripture

750
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,080
that tells us that God is good and God is merciful

751
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,360
tells us that God preserves his word.

752
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,040
That his truth endureth to all generations.

753
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,280
This morning, I've already asked the question in 2023,

754
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,360
are we still part of every generation?

755
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,320
Absolutely.

756
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,640
Are we part of forever?

757
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
Are we part of to all generations?

758
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,520
Absolutely.

759
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,400
And God has preserved his word.

760
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,040
And so we understand that the truth,

761
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,840
the promise of preservation is linked

762
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,680
to the very character of God.

763
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
God said he would do it.

764
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,200
Preservation extends to the very words.

765
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,720
This morning, there's groups of people

766
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
that have been producing new versions of Bibles

767
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,280
for several decades now.

768
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,600
And there's a school of thought that,

769
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,920
well, God's word is, you know,

770
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,240
the Bible contains God's words, but it's not God's word.

771
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,360
There are people that have the idea

772
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,920
that it's just the thoughts.

773
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,040
No, it's the very words.

774
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,720
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

775
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,760
And he says that he would preserve the words.

776
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
Remember, we looked already there in Matthew 4,

777
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
in verse number four, but by every word,

778
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,640
he says in Matthew 24 and verse number 35,

779
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,400
that his words shall not pass away.

780
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,560
Listen, the words matter.

781
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
I mean, which ones can we cut out?

782
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,560
And don't take a pen knife and just start cutting out

783
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
the ones that you would rather not have

784
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,760
because I don't want to submit to that.

785
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,160
No one seems to want to change John 3 16.

786
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,840
No, no, no, that one's in all of the manuscripts.

787
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,840
But these ones over here, well, you know, no, no, no, no.

788
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,240
Who becomes the authority?

789
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,200
God said he would preserve it, and he has.

790
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
And it's the very words.

791
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Notice in Revelation 22, turn over there if you will.

792
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,000
In Revelation 22, and I know we've been

793
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,880
in a number of passages this morning.

794
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,760
Revelation chapter 22.

795
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,000
In Revelation 22, in verse number 18,

796
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,120
notice the Bible says this,

797
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,640
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words

798
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,320
of the prophecy of this book.

799
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
If any man shall add unto these things,

800
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,000
God shall add unto him the plagues

801
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that are written in this book.

802
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
And if any man shall take away from what?

803
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,360
From the words of the book of this prophecy,

804
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,400
God shall take away his part of the book of life

805
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,240
and out of the holy city,

806
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,360
and from the words of the book of this prophecy,

807
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
God shall take away his part of the book of life

808
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,160
and out of the holy city.

809
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,080
And from the things which are written in this book.

810
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,400
So if you look at verse 18 and 19 of Revelation 22,

811
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,640
do you think God's concerned about the words?

812
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Absolutely.

813
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,200
You can look over in the book of Deuteronomy,

814
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,120
and we referenced this last week,

815
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,120
and you can see in Deuteronomy chapter number four,

816
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,760
where the Bible very specifically talks about the words.

817
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,280
And see, God is concerned about the words.

818
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,600
Again, as I mentioned last week,

819
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,320
there's no filler in this Bible.

820
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
There's no filler.

821
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,080
God gave us exactly what he wanted us to have.

822
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,920
And when we find that there's verses that are repeated,

823
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,280
when you find that there are phrases that are repeated,

824
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,160
such as you find with, I mentioned already,

825
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,160
the mercy of the Lord, that his mercy endureth forever.

826
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,680
You read Psalm 136, and you see every single verse

827
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,760
in that chapter says the mercy of the Lord,

828
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,920
it endureth forever, it endureth forever.

829
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,480
And why does he keep saying that?

830
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,280
Because he wants us to know.

831
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,840
That his mercy endureth forever.

832
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,080
Sometimes we repeat something

833
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,760
because we just don't know what to say next.

834
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
God doesn't do that.

835
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Every word is precious, and every word is important.

836
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,720
And we find that the truth of preservation,

837
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,240
it's not just that God preserved his thoughts,

838
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,280
and some people fill in all the, no, no.

839
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
God preserved his words.

840
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,000
And we find that the truth of preservation

841
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,720
is that, no, no, God preserved his words.

842
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,480
By the way, preservation, I believe,

843
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,320
is something that we accept by faith.

844
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,840
Preservation is something we accept by faith.

845
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,520
God said it, and God does it.

846
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,360
You know, there's no promise that God has given

847
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
that he's not fulfilled.

848
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I often take great joy in reading the passage

849
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,480
in Matthew with regard to the resurrection

850
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,080
when the disciples arrive and the angel says,

851
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,320
come and see the place where the Lord laid.

852
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,320
He is not here, for he has risen as he said.

853
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,400
God always does what he says he will do.

854
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,680
He's not a man that he should lie, amen?

855
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,120
He's able to do what he's promised to do.

856
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
I've used the illustration before.

857
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,880
Juliana's here this morning.

858
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,080
She probably doesn't remember it

859
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,400
because she was just a toddler,

860
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,880
but I made a promise to Juliana when I was,

861
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,280
she was just a little toddler,

862
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
and I promised her that on Saturday

863
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,880
of this particular week that we would do

864
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,600
this particular activity.

865
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,640
It was an outdoor activity.

866
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,720
I said, Juliana, I promise you.

867
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,560
She wanted to do it, wanted to do it, wanted to do it,

868
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,680
and I was working and all kinds of stuff going on.

869
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,920
I said, on Saturday, honey,

870
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,280
I promise we're gonna do this on Saturday.

871
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,000
It poured rain.

872
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,280
I mean, just poured.

873
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,680
And we couldn't do what I had promised Ron that we would do.

874
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,120
And as a little two-year-old,

875
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:11,620
old girl, she looked at me and she said these words, but daddy, you promised.

876
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,480
I can't control the weather.

877
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,160
I couldn't fulfill, and so I never made another promise.

878
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,640
I learned that I can't promise something that I don't have the control of being able to

879
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
fulfill.

880
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,240
I intend, I plan.

881
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,200
You just pick different words, amen?

882
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,880
But God has promised, and God does.

883
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,200
Notice in the book of 1 Thessalonians, notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 2.

884
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,080
We talk about the truth that these principles, if you will, of biblical preservation, the

885
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,680
truth that God has promised to preserve and understanding the process, but notice that

886
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,100
preservation, it's accepted by faith.

887
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,860
Many people will attack the Bible.

888
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,980
It's nothing new, started in Genesis.

889
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,820
Many people will attack the Bible, but we this morning, we accept by faith that God

890
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:16,380
has done what God said He would do, and I want you to notice what the believers in Thessalonica,

891
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,500
I want you to understand how Paul commends them in verse number 13.

892
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,660
If you study the book of 1 Thessalonians, in fact, you'll find that the believers in

893
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:30,580
Thessalonica are commended for a number of things, but specifically with regard to the

894
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,060
topic of our message this morning, I want you to notice in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse

895
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,460
13, the Bible says this, for this cause also thank we God without ceasing.

896
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,060
Now think about just the preface of how Paul is saying this.

897
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,620
This thing that I'm about to say to you has so impacted us as the apostles, as the ones

898
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,700
that have been privileged of God to bring you the gospel message and to bring you the

899
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:01,180
Word of God, this thing that I'm about to say has caused us to thank God without ceasing.

900
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,860
That's pretty significant.

901
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
What is it?

902
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,700
What is it, Paul, that's so important?

903
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:12,420
What is it, Paul, that's had such a profound impact upon you that you are thanking God

904
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:19,260
without ceasing because when you received the Word of God, which you heard of us, you

905
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:27,700
received it not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which effectually

906
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,620
worketh also in you that believe.

907
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,140
Paul was saying, listen, I'm rejoicing greatly.

908
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,140
I am thanking God without ceasing.

909
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,140
Why?

910
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,540
Because we came to you.

911
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,500
Notice, we don't have time this morning to look at the beginning of chapter number one

912
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,140
and the beginning of chapter number two and to see how Paul is saying, listen, we came

913
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,820
and we were speaking to you.

914
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,860
We were bold in verse number two in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much

915
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,940
contention, he says in verse number four, but as we are allowed of God to be put in

916
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,380
trust with the gospel, even so we speak not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our

917
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,660
hearts and they received it as it was the Word of God.

918
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,100
They didn't say, oh, this is what Paul says, let's next, who's got something else to tell

919
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
us?

920
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
No, no.

921
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:25,260
They heard it and they accepted it in faith that this is the Word of God.

922
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,560
This morning we accept it by faith.

923
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,720
I would finish by saying this this morning, questioning preservation is the starting point

924
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,960
for apostasy.

925
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,640
Questioning preservation is the starting point for apostasy.

926
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,560
Pastor, why do you say that?

927
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,660
Because if this book isn't true, everything falls apart.

928
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,520
If every Word of God isn't pure, if all Scripture isn't given by inspiration of God and preserved

929
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,720
everything starts falling apart.

930
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
It's your opinion.

931
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
It's their opinion.

932
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,840
It's your scholarly, quote, unquote, ability.

933
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:13,240
But I'd rather say God, who's eternal, gave me a promise that He's going to preserve His

934
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Word.

935
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,320
See, why is it the starting point of apostasy?

936
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,720
Well, because Satan, as the serpent in Genesis chapter number three, he's more subtle than

937
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,720
any other beast of the field.

938
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:36,760
He comes to the garden and here's what he says, "'Yea, hath God said,' questioning the

939
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,020
Scripture."

940
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,960
God said it and it's settled.

941
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Why?

942
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,600
Because God said, all Scripture is given by inspiration, but He said, I'll preserve it.

943
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:56,560
This morning, I mentioned already that inspiration is great for the original recipients.

944
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,920
Inspiration is great for us, but if inspiration without preservation, I'm not an original

945
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,400
recipient.

946
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:12,560
But inspiration and preservation together are two wonderful Bible truths that cause

947
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,920
us to have great confidence in the book that we hold in our laps this morning, God's Word,

948
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,280
that this book is powerful, it's alive, and this morning it abides forever.

949
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,040
Listen, next week, the week after, we're going to start talking about, okay, so we understand

950
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,600
what the Bible is, but now how do I approach the Bible?

951
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,160
I said this multiple times two weeks ago.

952
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,880
Before we talk about what the Bible says, we must agree on what the Bible is.

953
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,680
If I don't agree with what the Bible is, then talking about what it says is just open for

954
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:56,640
debate, but when we can agree that this book is God's Word and it's been providentially

955
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:05,240
preserved for us without any loss or alteration, then we start getting into, okay, what does

956
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
it say?

957
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,680
Because we agree that this is God's Word, and therefore, because it's God's Word and

958
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,960
it's been preserved for us, this book is authoritative, this book is essential for my life.

959
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Why do we say, read your Bible?

960
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,320
Because it's God's Word.

961
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,300
If I don't believe that this book is God's Word, why am I going to read it?

962
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,800
If it's just man's word about God?

963
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,640
No, no, no.

964
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:39,200
When we understand what this book is, then we dig in to see what this book says, and

965
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,600
we need to take heed to what this book says because this book is the Word of God, and

966
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,200
I'm so thankful for the biblical truth of preservation, and we can have great confidence

967
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,840
this morning.

968
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,600
We can sing, hallelujah, I'm saved.

969
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,120
How do you know you're saved?

970
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,160
Because God gave His Bible, and God preserved it, because if you don't believe in preservation

971
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,720
this morning, how do you know the way to Christ?

972
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,880
I know the way of salvation because I believe that God preserved His Word.

973
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:23,920
Everything falls apart without inspiration and preservation, but our God, who is eternal,

974
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,160
who is able, He said, I will preserve it, I will preserve it from this generation forever.

975
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,680
The Word of the Lord endureth forever, hallelujah.

976
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
Let's pray.

977
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,480
Father, how we love You, how we thank You for loving us.

978
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,520
I'm thankful that You gave Your Word by inspiration.

979
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,560
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

980
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,320
It's profitable.

981
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:54,480
I'm thankful this morning that You promised to preserve Your Word.

982
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,840
I believe this morning that we have the perfect preserved Word of God.

983
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm so thankful that You fulfill Your promises.

984
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,240
We can speak about the process and various principles, and I pray that You'd help us

985
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:20,120
this morning to rejoice in understanding the truth, the teaching of preservation.

986
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:28,280
We pray that, Lord, You would help us to dig into the truth of Your Word, that we'd search

987
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,680
the Scriptures, that we'd study to show ourselves approved unto God.

988
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Why?

989
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:38,080
Because we understand that this book is the preserved Word of God.

990
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,120
Help us to apply truth in our lives, Lord, help us as we pray so often to be doers of

991
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,360
the Word and not hearers only.

992
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,960
I pray that as we leave here in just a few moments that we'd rejoice greatly in knowing

993
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,160
that we have the Word of God.

994
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,360
Thank You for preserving Your Word for us.

995
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Lord, I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven, Lord, I pray that today

996
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,240
would be the day of their salvation.

997
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,160
We talk much about the Bible, but we spoke much about salvation as well.

998
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,720
Lord, if there's one present, one that's tuned in via live stream, that's not sure of heaven,

999
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,400
oh, God, I pray that You would move in their heart this morning.

1000
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,080
We'd have the opportunity to take the Bible and show them how they could know for sure

1001
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,920
that heaven is their home.

1002
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,400
Lord, I pray that You'd help each child of God to be encouraged this morning through

1003
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:37,320
this promise of preservation and to recognize that preservation reveals Your greatness.

1004
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,800
I pray that You'd move and work in the few moments of invitation for it's in Christ's

1005
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
name we pray.

1006
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Would You stand with me?

1007
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,480
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around this morning.

1008
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,440
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you could know

1009
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,920
for sure that heaven's your home.

1010
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,040
Remember this morning, you just want to come and thank God for the Bible.

1011
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,200
Thank Him for this truth of preservation and His greatness that is revealed there.

1012
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,120
And maybe the Lord spoke to your heart through some other way.

1013
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,120
to thank Him for salvation. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
