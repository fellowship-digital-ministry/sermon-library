00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.799
your last name publicly,

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:03.359
but it's certainly good to see you this morning.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:04.880
We're thankful that you could be here.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.920
And then Juliana and Evan are here this morning as well,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.279
and they're doing well.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.279
Juliana's struggling with some morning sickness,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.399
but that's to be expected.

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:14.479
And it's good to have them.

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.459
They'll be traveling back this afternoon

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:18.159
and thankful for the visit

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:19.639
that we've been able to have this weekend.

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:21.360
We'll get to Psalm 12, six and seven,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.639
but after they sang that song,

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.600
I thought we should start here in 1 Peter 1.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.280
And verse number 23 says this,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.360
"'Being born again, not of corruptible seed,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.000
but of incorruptible,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840
by the Word of God which liveth

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.520
and abideth forever.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.319
For all flesh is as grass

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.639
and all the glory of man

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.279
is the flower of grass.

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.400
The grass withereth

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.439
and the flower thereof falleth away,

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.759
but the Word of the Lord

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.720
endureth forever.'"

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.000
And this is the Word,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.319
which by the Gospel is preached unto you.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.720
This morning, we're gonna look at this subject,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.199
Preservation Reveals the Greatness of God.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.959
Our theme for 2023,

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.879
Great is the Lord and Greatly to be Praised.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.919
And our God is great,

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:13.199
and I'm so thankful that He's revealed to us

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:14.400
through the pages of Scripture

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.239
that He's a great God.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.199
I'm thankful that the psalmist said this,

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:20.879
I know that the Lord is great.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.599
And I hope this morning that each of us,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.879
as we've entered into this worship service,

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.480
that we would agree with the psalmist

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.639
and we would say, I know that the Lord is great.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:31.919
But then the psalmist says this,

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.000
and there's no contradiction in what he says,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.360
he says this, that His greatness,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.720
God's greatness is unsearchable

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.160
because the reality is as great as you think

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
that God is today, He's greater.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.440
As great as you think He is tomorrow,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.400
as your understanding of God's greatness

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.519
will increase as you walk with God,

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.639
He's greater.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.199
He's greater still.

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.680
And the psalmist comes to this great declaration

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680
and he says this, I will declare thy greatness.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.639
And that's where each of us need to be in our lives,

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.080
that we understand that God is great,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.319
but then we declare His greatness.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.320
We look at the fact that creation reveals

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.600
the greatness of God.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.119
I'm so thankful that God said, and it was so.

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.160
I'm thankful that the Bible reveals to us

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.559
and records for us the origin of man,

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.759
the origin of the universe.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.919
And God tells us that He is the creator.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.240
He tells us how He did it.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.039
What a blessing to understand the truth of creation

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.800
and then to understand that the creator God is my helper.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.839
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.080
from whence cometh my help.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.520
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.440
And what a joy to know that the creator God is my helper.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.720
He's your helper.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.759
And we can go to Him understanding that He is able

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.199
to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.000
Last week, we looked at the truth of inspiration.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.440
Inspiration reveals the greatness of God.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.160
And what a blessing to understand how God gave us His word.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.240
We said this last week,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.679
that the Bible is the greatest of all books.

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.559
The Bible is the best-selling book of all time.

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.960
It's the most translated book of all time.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.199
And we are so blessed this morning to have the Bible.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.119
We asked this question and we answered it last week,

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.320
and we'll reference it again this morning.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.000
What is it about the Bible that sets it apart

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:22.679
from every other book?

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.039
What is it about this book that makes it

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.600
the greatest book of all time?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.240
What is it that makes it the best-selling

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.919
and most translated book?

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.039
We understand this, that God, who alone is great,

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.000
is the author of this book.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It is God's word.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.320
It is not man's word.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.279
It is God's word.

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:43.559
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:44.720
We dealt with that last week.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.759
And I'm so thankful for the truth of inspiration.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.639
But the reality is that inspiration without preservation

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.559
is great for the original recipients.

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.559
But there's not one of us that are the original recipients.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.000
So I'm thankful this morning for the truth of preservation.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.199
The word preservation means this,

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.479
the providential keeping of the original text

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.239
from loss or alteration.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.279
And I'm thankful that as you think about

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.440
that definition of preservation,

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:26.799
that we have this morning the word of God.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.519
And we can have confidence in what we hold

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:32.839
in our hands this morning that this is God's word,

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.000
that God is the one that has promised

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.040
to providentially keep His word.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.000
And we understand this morning,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.920
even as we read this text of scripture

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.440
in 1 Peter chapter number one,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.880
that we're born again not of corruptible seed

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.000
but of incorruptible.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.880
By the word of God which liveth and abideth forever.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.079
How is it that you were aware of the fact

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:54.119
that you were a sinner in need of a Savior?

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.000
How was it that you were aware of the fact

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that God is gracious and He's merciful

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.799
and He loves you and He died for you

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.519
and He was buried and He rose again

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.399
and He offers eternal life?

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.799
You know those truths because of this book.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.600
And it's been preserved for us this morning.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.440
How do we know?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.640
We sing songs, we're singing this morning

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.399
and you begin to think about the future

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.839
of the child of God, the hope that we have

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.839
and the return of the Lord and the truth of eternity.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.559
How is it, what is it that gives us that hope,

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.559
that confidence, it's this book

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.079
that's been preserved for us this morning.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:38.079
I believe that preservation reveals the greatness of God.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.880
I'm thankful that He gave it by inspiration.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.480
God breathed, but I'm thankful that He's preserved it.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.799
I've heard people say this over the years.

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:50.440
Nowhere in the Bible does God say

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.079
that He would preserve His word.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.519
The problem is that they're using the wrong Bible.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320
Turn over to Psalm 12, it's where we were going

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.000
to begin this morning before they sang that song.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.160
By the way, it was quite interesting.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.880
I referenced Anywhere With Jesus

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.399
in Sunday school this morning and then we're singing it.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.920
And I had a couple of people come to me and say,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.040
did you know we were singing that song?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480
I had no idea actually.

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:12.559
I don't pick the songs, Dean does,

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.720
and we just roll with it.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.399
I saw the list, but I didn't even look up

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.559
the songs this week.

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.600
And Anywhere With Jesus, the songwriter said in verse five,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.480
I can go to sleep.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.239
And we saw Peter sleeping between those soldiers

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:26.519
this morning in Acts chapter number 12.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.399
But look here in Psalm 12 in verses six and seven.

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.760
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.720
number one, the promise of preservation.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.320
The Bible says this in verse six,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.480
the words of the Lord are pure words.

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:41.040
We mentioned this last week that they're pure words

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.600
because they're God's words.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.880
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.640
And because they're God's words, they're pure.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.119
They're without error.

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:52.920
They are trustworthy, they are reliable.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.519
And we can go to the Bible and we can have confidence,

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:00.359
even as the wise man says in Proverbs 30,

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:02.359
the word of the Lord, it's pure.

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:05.359
Every word of God is pure.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.959
We find here that the Bible says that they are pure words.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:09.799
Why?

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:10.640
Because they're God's words.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.559
And notice he says as silver tried in a furnace of earth,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.959
purified seven times.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.399
Many of us have no idea about metalworking

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.559
and we've never done it.

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.959
We're not experienced in metalworking.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.239
Obviously there's some people during the time

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:28.880
of this writing that would have understood

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.480
the reference here to silver being tried

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.760
in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.480
For most of us, our only understanding of that

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.679
is by looking it up and studying something

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:40.040
about metalworking.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.679
But what I understand, I've never done it personally,

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:44.519
but what I understand through study

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.440
is that they would say that the purest silver

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.200
you could receive is silver that was tried seven times.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.079
That's how pure this book is.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.000
And notice what he says.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.200
We understand the truth of inspiration,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.920
but when we look at the promise of preservation,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.640
notice in verse number seven,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.640
thou shalt keep them, oh Lord.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.119
Thou shalt, what does it say?

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:18.119
Preserve them from this generation forever.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.959
This promise that we find in Psalm 12 in verse number seven

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:26.359
with regard to the truth of preservation

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:29.040
is a precious promise that we hold dear

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.760
and we rejoice in this promise.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.840
And we understand that the Lord himself

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.320
has made this promise and let me say this,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.799
God is the only one that could fulfill this promise

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.840
because he's the only one that's eternal.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840
He's the only one that can say,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.039
I will preserve this word, my word,

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:51.599
from this generation forever because he's the eternal God.

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:53.400
No church can make that claim,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.440
no individual can make that claim,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.359
but God Almighty, the one who's the creator,

00:08:58.359 --> 00:09:00.760
the one that spoke everything into existence,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.400
the one who's my redeemer

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.039
that they sang about this morning,

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:08.039
he gave us a promise that he would preserve his word

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:12.640
and he said from this generation and forever.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.919
I'm thankful that we still fall

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:19.359
within the category of this generation forever, amen?

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:22.320
God is alpha and omega.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.719
He's the first and the last.

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.400
He's outside of time, he is the eternal God

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.000
and he's given us this promise this morning

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.440
and we ought to rejoice that God Almighty

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.919
has given us a promise

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:38.799
and he alone is able to fulfill that promise.

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.520
See, the reality this morning

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.520
is that the promise is only as good as the one who makes it.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.640
A promise is only as good as the one who makes it.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.080
You could promise something all day long,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.159
you could promise your kids,

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.960
you could promise some other person

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.159
and you can make promises,

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:59.799
but the reality is that God Almighty made this promise

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.640
and he.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.680
is able to fulfill it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.580
I would say this morning that he has fulfilled it.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.640
Forever, O Lord, the psalmist said,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.140
thy word is settled in heaven.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.940
Oh, no doubt, and we'll look at some of this next week,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.560
there have been many that have sought to destroy it.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.360
There have been many that have tried to alter it.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.000
But remember that definition of preservation

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.560
is the providential keeping of the original text

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.040
from loss or alteration.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.920
It's very interesting that this morning

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.920
there's much with regard to the alteration of God's word.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.720
And they seek to change it and what have you,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.360
but we find this morning that God's given us this promise.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.080
Turn to the book of, right here in Psalm, Psalm 119.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.340
Look over at what the psalmist says.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.600
We'll look at two verses.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.940
I've already referenced Psalm 119 in verse 89,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.920
where the Bible says, forever, O Lord,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.280
thy word is settled in heaven.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.460
I wanna draw your attention to Psalm 119, 160.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.720
Psalm 119, and look at verse number 160.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.520
Notice what the Bible says.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.000
The psalmist says, thy word is true from the beginning.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.040
Thy word is true from the beginning.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.240
And then notice, and every one of thy righteous judgments

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.520
endureth, how long?

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.360
Forever.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.800
So does that mean that this morning in 2023,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.520
can we have confidence in our Bible?

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.760
Absolutely.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.000
We can have confidence this morning

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.920
that God has fulfilled what he said he would fulfill

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.680
and that his word is going to endure forever

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.680
because he gave the promise.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.240
And that oughta cause us to rejoice.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.680
Listen, when we think about the truth of preservation,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.240
look over to the New Testament.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.960
Notice this, Christ declared the truth of preservation.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.940
The Lord Jesus Christ, he declared this truth.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.680
Look in the book of Matthew, if you will,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360
in Matthew chapter number four,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.640
we'll look at the several verses of Scripture

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.100
through the Gospels and referencing this morning

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.640
that the Lord Jesus Christ declared

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.720
the truth of preservation.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.640
Here in Matthew chapter number four,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.600
and we know that this is the passage of Scripture,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.760
the Gospel account in Matthew's Gospel

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.480
of the temptation of the Lord.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.520
And the Bible says this in verse number four,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.640
but he answered and said, it is written,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.880
man shall not live by bread alone,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.880
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.840
The Lord Jesus Christ made this statement here

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.720
during his earthly ministry, during this time of temptation

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.880
and we find that he's quoting Deuteronomy chapter eight

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.980
in verse number three.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.240
He's quoting that book that was written

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.280
many, many, many, many centuries prior,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.720
but he's quoting it, why?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.520
Because the word of the Lord endureth forever.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.920
God's word, the truth of preservation.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.560
Notice in Matthew 24,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.200
and notice what the Bible says here

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.840
is Jesus is giving answers to those

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.920
that have asked questions

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.220
and he gives us this great truth with regard,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.400
again, to the truth and the teaching of preservation.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.520
In Matthew chapter 24, in verse number 35,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.440
Matthew 24 in verse 35,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.800
the Lord Jesus Christ said,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.960
heaven and earth shall pass away,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.840
but my words, my words shall not pass away.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.180
Heaven and earth shall pass away,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.720
but my words shall not pass away.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.880
In the gospel of Mark,

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.440
Mark records for us in Mark chapter number 12

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.280
in verse number 24,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.480
this truth again with regard to preservation.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.840
And it's interesting because in this particular passage

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.720
in Mark chapter 12,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.160
I'll give you a moment to turn there

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.520
and before I read the verses that I wanna deal with,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.800
we find once again that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.060
is being confronted by those that are seeking to attack him

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.800
and seeking to trip him up with some teachings

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800
and what have you.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.660
And we find that the ones that are coming to him

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.040
in this particular account are the Sadducees.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.920
Now, something interesting about the Sadducees

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.920
is that they did not believe in the resurrection.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.620
Some Bible scholars have said that's why they're sad,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.740
you see, because they don't believe in the resurrection.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.660
But the reality is that there were several things

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.580
they didn't believe in,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.980
but one of them is the resurrection.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.620
It's quite interesting because they come to Jesus.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.580
Now, understand, they don't believe in the resurrection,

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.220
but they say in verse number 18,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.660
which say there's no resurrection,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.980
and they asked him saying,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.900
Master, Moses wrote,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.420
and he goes through this whole situation,

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.020
and he says in verse 23,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.420
these false teachers, these Sadducees,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.220
they say in the resurrection, therefore,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.380
when they shall rise,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.060
whose wife shall she be of them?

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.860
For the seven had heard a wife.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.580
They didn't believe in the resurrection,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.100
but they're trying to catch Jesus in something,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.260
and they're trying to trip him up.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.460
They didn't believe in the resurrection,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.820
but yet they say in the resurrection, therefore,

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.260
but notice the answer that Jesus gives.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.540
In verse number 24, Jesus said this,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.940
do ye not therefore err?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.780
Why?

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.340
Because you know not the scriptures.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.760
Because you know not the scriptures.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.600
What's he referring to?

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.440
He's referring to the Old Testament,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.120
to the writings of Moses in which they're referring to,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.580
and he says you err, why?

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.040
Because you do not know the scriptures.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040
Notice where he says this,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.120
neither the power of God.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.200
I believe this morning

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.080
that there's certainly an understanding

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.240
with regard to the truth of preservation

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.360
and the promise of preservation of God's power.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.040
No, I believe that God has the power.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.240
He has the ability to preserve his word.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.880
I ask this question of people

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.840
that don't believe in preservation.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.480
They don't believe that God has preserved

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.040
as he said that he would.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.560
You believe that he's gonna take you to heaven one day,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.160
but you don't believe that he can preserve his word.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.260
That's questionable.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.880
God promised to preserve his word.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.240
The Lord Jesus Christ, during his earthly ministry,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.880
he declared, he referenced the truth of preservation.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.920
The apostles, they taught the truth of preservation.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.640
We've read already there in 1 Peter 1,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.320
it's where we started this morning,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.920
and we read where Peter,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.560
he talks about the preservation of scripture.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.280
He says in just a couple of verses,

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.660
he talks about how it abideth forever.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.640
He says in verse 25 of 1 Peter 1,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.080
but the word of the Lord endureth forever.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.640
He gives the truth in verse number 24,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.360
for all flesh is as grass,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.320
and all the glory of man is the flower of grass.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.300
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof felleth away.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.800
Listen, we see that in life.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.360
We understand that.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.400
Things come and things go,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.640
but we understand this morning that Peter's saying,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.560
but listen, that's not like the Bible.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.520
That's not like the word of God,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.220
because the word of God endureth forever.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.080
I'm so thankful for that.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.680
We read last week about the truth of inspiration,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.920
and Paul made the claim there

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.600
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.720
in 2 Timothy 3,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.400
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.640
and is profitable,

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.240
but before he said that,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.120
he said to Timothy in verse number 15,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.920
that thou, you've learned these things,

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.040
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.600
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.280
What are these holy scriptures that he's referring to?

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.360
Again, the Old Testament.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360
So what are they teaching?

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.980
They're teaching this truth of preservation,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.800
that God's word has been preserved.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.920
It's interesting to me,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.320
in 2 Timothy chapter four,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.400
turn there, if you will,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.800
in 2 Timothy chapter number four,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.820
Paul is, of course, near the end of his life,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.480
and he's given that great declaration

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.080
that he's ready to be offered,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.680
and we're familiar with verses six through eight.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.120
We often reference those,

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.880
and Paul coming to the end of his life with no regrets,

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.520
understanding that he's finished his course,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.840
he's kept the faith,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.560
and what a joy and what a blessing

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.120
to be able to finish in that matter.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.540
But I want you to notice,

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.640
as he closes out the text of scripture

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.240
in this book to Timothy,

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.320
he gives some parting comments

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.740
beginning in verse number nine.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.800
I want to draw your attention

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.360
specifically to verse number 13

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.640
as it's applicable to our message this morning.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.480
He says this,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.160
the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.280
when thou comest, bring with thee,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.120
end the books,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.119
but then notice what he says,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.679
but especially the parchments.

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:38.640
Do you know what he's referring to

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.119
when he says especially the parchments?

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:43.359
He's talking about the Old Testament scriptures,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.160
and he understands the truth of preservation.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.320
He understands the power of the word of God,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.440
and he says, listen,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.679
there's some things that I want you to bring,

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:56.160
and he talks about a cloak,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.880
and he talks about the books

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.880
that he references there in verse number 13,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.679
but I love how he uses the phraseology

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:07.200
when he says, but especially the parchments.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.640
Listen, if you forget the cloak,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.679
if you don't have room for the other books,

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:11.600
don't worry,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.359
just make sure you bring the parchments.

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:17.040
I understand that there's a story

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.500
about a missionary in Africa

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.799
years and years and years ago,

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.920
decades ago,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.760
and he was going,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.320
and he's going into the jungle,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.160
into the bush,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.720
and it was a very difficult trail,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.119
and it was a difficult journey,

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:29.320
and all of the obstacles that we're facing,

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.440
and he had brought with him

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.640
a great load of things

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.480
that he was planning to use for ministry,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.840
and along the way,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.799
he realized that it's just not gonna be possible

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:39.000
to take everything that he brought with him.

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:43.500
The load was too large.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.559
So along the way,

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.480
he had to choose some things to part with.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.040
The missionary decided,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.720
I don't need these things,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.559
I can do without these,

00:19:55.559 --> 00:20:00.119
and as he tried to continually decrease the load,

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:00.960
it just became.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.200
became more and more difficult to make the journey, the trek, with anything.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.040
The one thing that he said he could not part with was this book.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.640
I can leave all the other books.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.720
I can leave the books that I thought would help me in ministry and what have you, but

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.220
I can't part with the Bible.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.320
And Paul, he says, listen, especially the parchments, understanding the truth of preservation

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.760
and teaching for us the truth of preservation.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.520
On Wednesday evening, Brother Tim came and asked me some questions down in my office.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.000
We had a good time chatting about preparation of messages and various things, and it was

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.920
a real good conversation.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.660
And we're standing there in my office, and there's bookshelves with books.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.680
And I said to him, I said, listen, all of those books have their place, but they cannot

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.540
take the place of this book.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.400
I've read a number of the books on my bookshelf.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.720
There are some that I've recommended for other people to read.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.240
They've been helpful.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.640
But I told Tim this.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.640
He can vouch for me.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.840
I said, listen, you read a commentary, a commentary is man's words about God's Word.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.120
Is that what I told you?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.960
The best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.920
You better dig in the Word of God.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920
Get into this book.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920
Why?

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.040
Because it's been preserved for us, and we can rejoice this morning in knowing that God

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.640
has given us this promise of preservation.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.200
We must hold dear to this promise and understand that He alone who made the promise is the

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.720
only one that can fulfill the promise.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.960
Now notice with me number two.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.720
We see the promise of preservation, but let me remind you of the process of preservation,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720
the process of preservation.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.200
We're not going to get deep into this this morning, but we find that the process of preservation,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.240
again, you find that the definition is the providential keeping of the original text

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.240
from loss or alteration.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.000
There are people today that are saying, well, I want to find the originals.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.440
If I could get the originals, then I'd believe it.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:12.240
But God promised to preserve, and so I don't need the original if my God promised to preserve

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.620
it and He has, and that preservation is the providential keeping, remember, of what?

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.480
The original.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.680
From loss or alteration.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:34.980
So if God has promised to preserve His Word, and He has, and God has always fulfilled what

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:41.760
He's promised, I don't need to search for an original.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.720
There's all this conversation that took place and still takes place today about the Dead

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.880
Sea Scrolls.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.200
No doubt you've heard about it.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.760
Listen, when God said He was going to preserve His Word, He didn't mean in some cave over

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.440
in Israel.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.720
And for 18 centuries of biblical Christianity, they don't have the Bible.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.280
It doesn't even make sense.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:11.840
God promised to preserve, and He's preserved His Word, and it's a providential, miraculous

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.800
work of God.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800
How did He do it?

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800
Well, He used His people.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.740
He used His people to carry out the work of preservation.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:26.160
But I want you to understand that God is the one who has providentially preserved.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.600
Though He would use people, it is God who is the one that's superseding.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.280
It's just like when you understand the truth of inspiration, we say, well, who wrote the

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280
book?

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.440
How many of you ever had that question?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.080
Maybe some of the teens, they won't ask it now, so I'm trying to get some of the hard

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.000
questions out of the way for the book of Genesis.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.840
No, I'm just kidding, I won't take any more.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.240
But the reality is that who wrote the book of Genesis?

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.640
Who wrote the book of, right, we hear that, right?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.640
But ultimately, that little boy in Sunday school or in junior church that has the same

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.440
answer for every question, God, God, you ever met that person that just, that's their answer

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440
for every question?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.760
Well, the reality is that God did write it.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.440
He's the author of Scripture, but God used man.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:20.120
God used human penmen to write the Word of God, and God has used man to preserve His

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.120
Word.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.840
But understand, it's not in some group of men that have preserved it.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.080
It's God that has preserved it using His people.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.960
Does that make sense this morning?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.520
And we must understand that, and we look at this process of preservation.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:49.940
Let's go to the book of Romans, if you will, Romans chapter number 3.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:59.080
In Romans chapter number 3, a question is asked, and we find that there's a great truth

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.200
that's revealed to us in answering that question.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.080
In verse number 1, the Bible says this, "'What advantage then hath the Jew, or what profit

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.320
is there of circumcision?'

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.960
And then notice what he says in verse number 2, "'Much every way, chiefly because that

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:23.080
unto them were committed the oracles of God.'"

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.360
That's a reference, another name that God uses for the Word of God, and we find that

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.860
God had committed to the Jewish people.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.900
You think about the scribes and what their responsibility was in writing out and giving

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:44.100
the copies of God's Word, and you understand how God would use and how God would work through

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.180
that process of preservation.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.820
Many times the originals weren't available.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820
Why?

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820
Because the originals were used.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:56.020
And once they got to a point where they weren't able to be read or able to be used any longer,

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.100
they would be destroyed, but you would have these copies, and the process of copying

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:09.140
out these scribes, the process that would follow was very, very specific and very detailed

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.620
as to what they would do and how they would do.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:18.260
You ever write something by hand, and you get down to the bottom, and you make an error,

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.860
and you just want to kind of cross it out and keep going, right, because you don't want

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.660
to have to start over?

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.660
They weren't allowed to do that.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.660
To make an error, you've got to throw the whole thing away and start over.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.460
They counted every letter.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:38.140
I mean, they were meticulous in their process, but it was God who was supernaturally preserving

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.140
His Word.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.180
I want you to think about this.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.180
The Bible says this in 1 Timothy 3, in verse number 15, that the church is the pillar and

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.500
ground of the truth.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:54.540
And in a very real sense, we find that God has used the church in preserving His Word,

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.540
His people.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.540
Notice over in Matthew chapter 28, a familiar passage of Scripture that each of us would

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.980
be familiar with, the Great Commission, in Matthew chapter 28, but we think about the

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:10.740
Great Commission in light of what I just mentioned about 1 Timothy 3 and verse 15, where the

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.960
Bible says that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.400
What is the truth?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400
The Bible.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400
The Bible.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400
Thy Word is truth.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.440
Jesus is truth, right?

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.400
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.740
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.880
He then says this in John 17, sanctify them by Thy Word.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.240
Thy Word is truth.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.160
And so we find that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth and that God has committed

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.800
to us the Word of God, the Bible, and what a blessing it is to have the Bible.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.220
But notice with me this process of preservation.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.960
How is it that God would use His power?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.920
He's obviously, or His people, He's supernaturally overseeing the providential preservation of

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920
His Word.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.640
But notice in verse 18 of Matthew 28, and Jesus came and spake unto them saying, all

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.360
power is given unto Me in heaven and earth.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.360
We mentioned just a little while ago in the Gospel of Mark where He said you do err not

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.480
knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.560
He says all power is given unto Me in heaven and earth.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.480
Aren't you thankful that you serve the omnipotent God and that the omnipotent God reigneth?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:22.080
What a joy and what a blessing to know His power.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:28.440
Notice the commission in verse 19, go ye therefore and teach all nations.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.080
What are we supposed to teach them?

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.700
The Word of God, the Gospel.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.380
Teach all nations, notice what He says, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.900
Son and of the Holy Ghost.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.140
So we understand that we give the Gospel, right?

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.020
What has to happen before somebody gets baptized?

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.679
Well, they've got to be saved, right?

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:54.980
If somebody comes to me and says, Pastor, I want to be baptized, I say, well, talk to

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.760
me about when you got saved.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.020
When did you trust Christ as your personal Savior?

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.100
Because if you haven't been saved yet, baptism is not yet for you.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:10.660
Because we believe the Bible plainly teaches that baptism, it's believer's baptism by

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.260
immersion.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.260
And we believe that.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.340
We can go to passages of Scripture.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.820
Remember the Ethiopian eunuch, he says, hey, Philip, there's water.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.260
What doth hinder me to be baptized?

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.660
If you believe, you may, right?

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.700
So we understand that as I stand in these waters just a couple of weeks ago, had baptism

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.420
and I stand here and I say, listen, Ethan, have you trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.420
your personal Savior?

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.980
Do you have assurance that heaven is your home?

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.220
He says, yes, I do.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.940
I say this, Ethan, according to your profession of faith, I now baptize you in the name of

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.940
the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, right?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.100
And so we understand that salvation, the Gospel has to be preached.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.780
We preach the Gospel.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.220
We give the truth of the death, the peril, and the glorious resurrection of our Savior.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.220
And then we baptize.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.220
but notice what it says in verse 20,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.660
teaching them to observe all things

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.860
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.340
Teaching who?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.940
Well, the people that got saved and got baptized, right?

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.400
If you look at verse 19,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.340
he says that we're to go into all nations,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.440
we're to teach all nations, baptizing them,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.420
and then we're to teach them.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.940
And so we would look at verse number 20

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.940
as being the truth of discipleship.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.900
See, it's not about just seeing people

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.940
make professions of faith and just getting them baptized.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.220
We want to see people saved

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.620
and we want to see them baptized,

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.860
but there's this need for discipleship.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.260
And notice what he says,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:46.260
teaching them to observe all things

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.860
whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.820
So if Jesus says to the disciples

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.740
that you're to command,

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.780
that you're to teach them to obey,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.420
to observe all things that I have commanded you,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.500
then does he, in giving this command,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.400
is there not a reference to preservation?

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.900
Because how are we gonna teach all things

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.020
if all things are not preserved?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.980
Does that make sense this morning?

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.500
And so we find that he says,

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.820
and lo, I am with you always,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.660
even under the end of the world.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.680
Bookends, if you will, to this wonderful command

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.020
that God has given us.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.100
In verse 18, he's all powerful.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.220
In verse number 20, he's everywhere present.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.580
He says, I've given you all things

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.300
and I'm commanding you.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.540
I have all power and I'm commanding you

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.260
to teach all these things,

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.260
whatsoever things I've commanded you,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.540
to these that have been saved and baptized.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.300
And by the way, he says, I am with you always,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.100
even under the end of the world.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.940
Amen.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.360
The church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.800
As the church preaches the gospel,

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.120
sees people saved and baptized and discipled,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.300
we see how God is continuing the work of preservation.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.840
We can look over the centuries

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.800
and we can see how God has supernaturally,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.440
providentially preserved his word

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.440
through using his people.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.240
Let me finish up number three,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.920
principles of Bible preservation.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.600
We look at the promise, the process,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.280
but then look at some principles.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.600
I want you to understand this morning

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.400
that preservation is linked to the very character of God.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.080
Preservation is linked to the very character of God.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.600
Turn to the book of Psalms again, Psalm 100.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.920
Psalm 100 is a familiar passage of scripture.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.880
In fact, many times we would be able to recite this passage

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.360
and what a joy to think about the truth

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.480
that God would contain in just five short verses

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.720
of scripture.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.320
In Psalm 100,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.960
we look at verse number five.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.320
Notice what the Bible says,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.360
for the Lord is good.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.560
Aren't you thankful that we have a good God?

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.200
The psalmist had declared earlier,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.400
taste and see that the Lord is good.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.440
He had experienced the goodness of God

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.480
and he desired for others to have that same experience,

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.080
to have that same understanding that God is good.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.800
By the way, it's his very nature.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.240
God's goodness is not dependent upon your circumstances.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.560
So many people in life have the idea

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.840
that when things are going well,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.320
when everything's kind of squared away, so to speak,

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.280
then God is good.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.800
But the reality is that God is good all of the time

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.880
because it's his nature.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.640
He's a good God.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.200
God is good.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.600
Notice it says this, his mercy is everlasting.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.400
Aren't you thankful for God's mercy?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.360
Ephesians chapter number two says it this way,

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.440
but God who is rich in mercy.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.720
I'm thankful for the mercy of God.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.600
His mercy endureth forever.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.760
And we this morning have been the recipients

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.840
of God's mercy.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.360
I'm thankful that God declares that he is a merciful God.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.720
And it says that he's good.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.320
It says that his mercy is everlasting,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.160
but then notice in verse number five,

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.160
and his truth endureth to all generations.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.600
Listen, the same verse of scripture

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.080
that tells us that God is good and God is merciful

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.360
tells us that God preserves his word.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.040
That his truth endureth to all generations.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.280
This morning, I've already asked the question in 2023,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.360
are we still part of every generation?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.320
Absolutely.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.640
Are we part of forever?

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.840
Are we part of to all generations?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.520
Absolutely.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.400
And God has preserved his word.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.040
And so we understand that the truth,

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.840
the promise of preservation is linked

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.680
to the very character of God.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.840
God said he would do it.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.200
Preservation extends to the very words.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.720
This morning, there's groups of people

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.760
that have been producing new versions of Bibles

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.280
for several decades now.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.600
And there's a school of thought that,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.920
well, God's word is, you know,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.240
the Bible contains God's words, but it's not God's word.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.360
There are people that have the idea

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.920
that it's just the thoughts.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.040
No, it's the very words.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.720
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.760
And he says that he would preserve the words.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.640
Remember, we looked already there in Matthew 4,

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.440
in verse number four, but by every word,

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.640
he says in Matthew 24 and verse number 35,

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.400
that his words shall not pass away.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.560
Listen, the words matter.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.400
I mean, which ones can we cut out?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.560
And don't take a pen knife and just start cutting out

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.400
the ones that you would rather not have

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.760
because I don't want to submit to that.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.160
No one seems to want to change John 3 16.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.840
No, no, no, that one's in all of the manuscripts.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.840
But these ones over here, well, you know, no, no, no, no.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.240
Who becomes the authority?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.200
God said he would preserve it, and he has.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.800
And it's the very words.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.080
Notice in Revelation 22, turn over there if you will.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.000
In Revelation 22, and I know we've been

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.880
in a number of passages this morning.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.760
Revelation chapter 22.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.000
In Revelation 22, in verse number 18,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.120
notice the Bible says this,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.640
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.320
of the prophecy of this book.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.400
If any man shall add unto these things,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.000
God shall add unto him the plagues

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
that are written in this book.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.600
And if any man shall take away from what?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.360
From the words of the book of this prophecy,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.400
God shall take away his part of the book of life

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.240
and out of the holy city,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.360
and from the words of the book of this prophecy,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.320
God shall take away his part of the book of life

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.160
and out of the holy city.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.080
And from the things which are written in this book.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.400
So if you look at verse 18 and 19 of Revelation 22,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.640
do you think God's concerned about the words?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.720
Absolutely.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.200
You can look over in the book of Deuteronomy,

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.120
and we referenced this last week,

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.120
and you can see in Deuteronomy chapter number four,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.760
where the Bible very specifically talks about the words.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.280
And see, God is concerned about the words.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.600
Again, as I mentioned last week,

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.320
there's no filler in this Bible.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.280
There's no filler.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.080
God gave us exactly what he wanted us to have.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.920
And when we find that there's verses that are repeated,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.280
when you find that there are phrases that are repeated,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.160
such as you find with, I mentioned already,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.160
the mercy of the Lord, that his mercy endureth forever.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.680
You read Psalm 136, and you see every single verse

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.760
in that chapter says the mercy of the Lord,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.920
it endureth forever, it endureth forever.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.480
And why does he keep saying that?

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.280
Because he wants us to know.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.840
That his mercy endureth forever.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.080
Sometimes we repeat something

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.760
because we just don't know what to say next.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.280
God doesn't do that.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.640
Every word is precious, and every word is important.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.720
And we find that the truth of preservation,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.240
it's not just that God preserved his thoughts,

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.280
and some people fill in all the, no, no.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.520
God preserved his words.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.000
And we find that the truth of preservation

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.720
is that, no, no, God preserved his words.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.480
By the way, preservation, I believe,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.320
is something that we accept by faith.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.840
Preservation is something we accept by faith.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.520
God said it, and God does it.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.360
You know, there's no promise that God has given

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.560
that he's not fulfilled.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.440
I often take great joy in reading the passage

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.480
in Matthew with regard to the resurrection

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.080
when the disciples arrive and the angel says,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.320
come and see the place where the Lord laid.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.320
He is not here, for he has risen as he said.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.400
God always does what he says he will do.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.680
He's not a man that he should lie, amen?

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.120
He's able to do what he's promised to do.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.600
I've used the illustration before.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.880
Juliana's here this morning.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.080
She probably doesn't remember it

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.400
because she was just a toddler,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.880
but I made a promise to Juliana when I was,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.280
she was just a little toddler,

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.200
and I promised her that on Saturday

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.880
of this particular week that we would do

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.600
this particular activity.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.640
It was an outdoor activity.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.720
I said, Juliana, I promise you.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.560
She wanted to do it, wanted to do it, wanted to do it,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.680
and I was working and all kinds of stuff going on.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.920
I said, on Saturday, honey,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.280
I promise we're gonna do this on Saturday.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.000
It poured rain.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.280
I mean, just poured.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.680
And we couldn't do what I had promised Ron that we would do.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.120
And as a little two-year-old,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:11.620
old girl, she looked at me and she said these words, but daddy, you promised.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.480
I can't control the weather.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.160
I couldn't fulfill, and so I never made another promise.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:26.640
I learned that I can't promise something that I don't have the control of being able to

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.560
fulfill.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.240
I intend, I plan.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.200
You just pick different words, amen?

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.880
But God has promised, and God does.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.200
Notice in the book of 1 Thessalonians, notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 2.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:48.080
We talk about the truth that these principles, if you will, of biblical preservation, the

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.680
truth that God has promised to preserve and understanding the process, but notice that

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.100
preservation, it's accepted by faith.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.860
Many people will attack the Bible.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.980
It's nothing new, started in Genesis.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.820
Many people will attack the Bible, but we this morning, we accept by faith that God

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:16.380
has done what God said He would do, and I want you to notice what the believers in Thessalonica,

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.500
I want you to understand how Paul commends them in verse number 13.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.660
If you study the book of 1 Thessalonians, in fact, you'll find that the believers in

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:30.580
Thessalonica are commended for a number of things, but specifically with regard to the

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.060
topic of our message this morning, I want you to notice in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.460
13, the Bible says this, for this cause also thank we God without ceasing.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.060
Now think about just the preface of how Paul is saying this.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:48.620
This thing that I'm about to say to you has so impacted us as the apostles, as the ones

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.700
that have been privileged of God to bring you the gospel message and to bring you the

00:41:53.700 --> 00:42:01.180
Word of God, this thing that I'm about to say has caused us to thank God without ceasing.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.860
That's pretty significant.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.860
What is it?

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.700
What is it, Paul, that's so important?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:12.420
What is it, Paul, that's had such a profound impact upon you that you are thanking God

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:19.260
without ceasing because when you received the Word of God, which you heard of us, you

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:27.700
received it not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which effectually

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.620
worketh also in you that believe.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.140
Paul was saying, listen, I'm rejoicing greatly.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.140
I am thanking God without ceasing.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.140
Why?

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.540
Because we came to you.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.500
Notice, we don't have time this morning to look at the beginning of chapter number one

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.140
and the beginning of chapter number two and to see how Paul is saying, listen, we came

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.820
and we were speaking to you.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.860
We were bold in verse number two in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.940
contention, he says in verse number four, but as we are allowed of God to be put in

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:04.380
trust with the gospel, even so we speak not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:10.660
hearts and they received it as it was the Word of God.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:16.100
They didn't say, oh, this is what Paul says, let's next, who's got something else to tell

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.100
us?

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.100
No, no.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:25.260
They heard it and they accepted it in faith that this is the Word of God.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.560
This morning we accept it by faith.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.720
I would finish by saying this this morning, questioning preservation is the starting point

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.960
for apostasy.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.640
Questioning preservation is the starting point for apostasy.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.560
Pastor, why do you say that?

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:53.660
Because if this book isn't true, everything falls apart.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.520
If every Word of God isn't pure, if all Scripture isn't given by inspiration of God and preserved

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.720
everything starts falling apart.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.720
It's your opinion.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720
It's their opinion.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.840
It's your scholarly, quote, unquote, ability.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:13.240
But I'd rather say God, who's eternal, gave me a promise that He's going to preserve His

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240
Word.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.320
See, why is it the starting point of apostasy?

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.720
Well, because Satan, as the serpent in Genesis chapter number three, he's more subtle than

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720
any other beast of the field.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:36.760
He comes to the garden and here's what he says, "'Yea, hath God said,' questioning the

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.020
Scripture."

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.960
God said it and it's settled.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.960
Why?

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:50.600
Because God said, all Scripture is given by inspiration, but He said, I'll preserve it.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:56.560
This morning, I mentioned already that inspiration is great for the original recipients.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.920
Inspiration is great for us, but if inspiration without preservation, I'm not an original

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.400
recipient.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:12.560
But inspiration and preservation together are two wonderful Bible truths that cause

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.920
us to have great confidence in the book that we hold in our laps this morning, God's Word,

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.280
that this book is powerful, it's alive, and this morning it abides forever.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.040
Listen, next week, the week after, we're going to start talking about, okay, so we understand

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.600
what the Bible is, but now how do I approach the Bible?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.160
I said this multiple times two weeks ago.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.880
Before we talk about what the Bible says, we must agree on what the Bible is.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.680
If I don't agree with what the Bible is, then talking about what it says is just open for

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:56.640
debate, but when we can agree that this book is God's Word and it's been providentially

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:05.240
preserved for us without any loss or alteration, then we start getting into, okay, what does

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.240
it say?

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.680
Because we agree that this is God's Word, and therefore, because it's God's Word and

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.960
it's been preserved for us, this book is authoritative, this book is essential for my life.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.400
Why do we say, read your Bible?

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.320
Because it's God's Word.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:26.300
If I don't believe that this book is God's Word, why am I going to read it?

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.800
If it's just man's word about God?

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.640
No, no, no.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:39.200
When we understand what this book is, then we dig in to see what this book says, and

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.600
we need to take heed to what this book says because this book is the Word of God, and

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.200
I'm so thankful for the biblical truth of preservation, and we can have great confidence

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.840
this morning.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.600
We can sing, hallelujah, I'm saved.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.120
How do you know you're saved?

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.160
Because God gave His Bible, and God preserved it, because if you don't believe in preservation

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:09.720
this morning, how do you know the way to Christ?

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:15.880
I know the way of salvation because I believe that God preserved His Word.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:23.920
Everything falls apart without inspiration and preservation, but our God, who is eternal,

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:31.160
who is able, He said, I will preserve it, I will preserve it from this generation forever.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.680
The Word of the Lord endureth forever, hallelujah.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.680
Let's pray.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.480
Father, how we love You, how we thank You for loving us.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.520
I'm thankful that You gave Your Word by inspiration.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.560
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.320
It's profitable.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.480
I'm thankful this morning that You promised to preserve Your Word.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:01.840
I believe this morning that we have the perfect preserved Word of God.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.480
I'm so thankful that You fulfill Your promises.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:13.240
We can speak about the process and various principles, and I pray that You'd help us

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:20.120
this morning to rejoice in understanding the truth, the teaching of preservation.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:28.280
We pray that, Lord, You would help us to dig into the truth of Your Word, that we'd search

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.680
the Scriptures, that we'd study to show ourselves approved unto God.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680
Why?

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:38.080
Because we understand that this book is the preserved Word of God.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:43.120
Help us to apply truth in our lives, Lord, help us as we pray so often to be doers of

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.360
the Word and not hearers only.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.960
I pray that as we leave here in just a few moments that we'd rejoice greatly in knowing

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.160
that we have the Word of God.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.360
Thank You for preserving Your Word for us.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.360
Lord, I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven, Lord, I pray that today

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.240
would be the day of their salvation.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.160
We talk much about the Bible, but we spoke much about salvation as well.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.720
Lord, if there's one present, one that's tuned in via live stream, that's not sure of heaven,

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.400
oh, God, I pray that You would move in their heart this morning.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.080
We'd have the opportunity to take the Bible and show them how they could know for sure

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.920
that heaven is their home.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.400
Lord, I pray that You'd help each child of God to be encouraged this morning through

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:37.320
this promise of preservation and to recognize that preservation reveals Your greatness.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.800
I pray that You'd move and work in the few moments of invitation for it's in Christ's

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800
name we pray.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800
Would You stand with me?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.480
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around this morning.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.440
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you could know

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.920
for sure that heaven's your home.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.040
Remember this morning, you just want to come and thank God for the Bible.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:59.200
Thank Him for this truth of preservation and His greatness that is revealed there.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.120
And maybe the Lord spoke to your heart through some other way.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.120
to thank Him for salvation. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
