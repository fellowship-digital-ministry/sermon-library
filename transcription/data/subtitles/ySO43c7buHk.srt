1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Chapter number five, 1 John chapter number five,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,559
we'll be looking at verses one through five this morning.

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,639
And as we enter into this fifth chapter,

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,960
we find that really John is going to provide us

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,279
with what I would refer to as

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,880
three characteristics of believers.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,100
We find that as we've studied through this book here

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,040
in 2022 with our theme coming from the first chapter,

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,780
it's been before us throughout the entire year

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,799
that we are to walk in the light.

11
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,760
And if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,959
we have fellowship one with another.

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,479
In the blood of Jesus Christ,

14
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:35,360
his son cleanseth us from all sin.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,779
I'm so thankful for the word of God,

16
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,520
for the truth that God has given us.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,619
And as we studied through the first four chapters,

18
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,880
we've made mention, oftentimes,

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,279
how the writer would give us, of course,

20
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,639
John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

21
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,479
would provide us what we have referred to

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,080
as being birthmarks of the believer.

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,240
If you say that you've been saved,

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,700
if you have trusted Jesus Christ as your personal savior,

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,459
there should be some evidence of life.

26
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,159
And if you go to the hospital,

27
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,459
one of the first things they do,

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,779
if you go to the doctor,

29
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:06,900
one of the first things they do

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
is they check your vital signs.

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,980
And they wanna check to make sure there's life.

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,080
And the reality is if they check their vital signs,

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,980
there's no pulse, there's a problem.

34
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,839
And we understand spiritually

35
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,739
that when we look at the life of a believer,

36
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:25,739
there should be some evidences of conversion,

37
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,160
that the Holy Spirit of God lives within you

38
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
and he's changed you.

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,599
The things that I used to do, I don't do them anymore.

40
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,680
The places I used to go, the things I used to say,

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,580
we sing all of those verses with the kids.

42
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,419
Why?

43
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:39,120
Because there's been a great change

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,620
since I've been born again.

45
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,919
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

46
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,540
The Bible says, old things are passed away,

47
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,599
behold, all things are become new.

48
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,540
As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word

49
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,040
that ye may grow, thereby he left us an example,

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,639
Peter says, that we're to follow his steps.

51
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,199
The book of Romans tells us this

52
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,319
in Romans chapter number eight,

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,279
that we are to be conformed to the image of his dear son.

54
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,959
I'm so thankful for the work that Christ has done in my life.

55
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,100
I'm so thankful for the wisdom of God,

56
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,639
that at the moment of salvation,

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,720
that the Holy Spirit of God indwells the believer.

58
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,199
And as he takes up residence,

59
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,119
he begins to clean house, amen?

60
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,539
And he begins to change us.

61
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,539
And what a joy to understand new life in Christ.

62
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,000
As we understand and as we've studied

63
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,320
in the book of 1 John,

64
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,960
we understand that John is never suggesting,

65
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,300
in fact, nowhere throughout the scriptures

66
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,720
would you ever find it suggested

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,479
that John or any other writer

68
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,639
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God is saying,

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,720
do these things so that you can be saved.

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,399
No, he says this, because you are saved,

71
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,639
this is what your life should look like, amen?

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,000
And it's not so that you can do these things to be saved

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,839
or do these things to even stay saved,

74
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:59,880
I'm secure in the hand of God.

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,119
John 10 says, my sheep hear my voice and I know them,

76
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:06,039
and I give unto them eternal life,

77
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,679
and they shall never perish.

78
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:12,639
Peter said it this way, that we're kept by the power of God.

79
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm so thankful for security.

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,960
We'll look at that next time in the book of 1 John.

81
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,839
I almost said next week, but I won't be here next week.

82
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,800
And so the next week after that,

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,399
we'll be looking at one of those most well-known verses

84
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,839
in the book of 1 John 5 in verse number 13,

85
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,880
what a great verse it is,

86
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,919
dealing with the security of the believer.

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,960
But this morning, as we look at these verses of scripture,

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,479
we will note a phrase that is repeated in verse number one

89
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,119
and then again in verse number four,

90
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:42,080
and it's this phrase, born of God.

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,339
Notice in verse number one of 1 John 5,

92
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,440
the Bible says, whosoever believeth

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,240
that Jesus is the Christ, notice this,

94
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,080
is born of God.

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,520
And everyone that loveth Him that begat,

96
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,479
loveth Him also that is begotten of Him.

97
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,559
By this we know that we love the children of God

98
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:05,759
when we love God and keep His commandments.

99
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,639
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments,

100
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,199
and His commandments are not grievous.

101
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,919
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world,

102
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,920
and this is the victory that overcometh the world,

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,279
even our faith.

104
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,739
Who is he that overcometh the world?

105
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,459
He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God.

106
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,579
So you see in verse number four,

107
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,260
it says, whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ

108
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
is born of God, and then in verse number four,

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,579
for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.

110
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm so thankful for salvation.

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,119
I'm so thankful to be part of the company of the redeemed.

112
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:39,959
Amen?

113
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,500
We sing the song, we didn't sing it this morning,

114
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
we don't sing the same songs every week,

115
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,179
but redeemed, how I love to proclaim it,

116
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:50,380
redeemed, there's only one way, by the blood of the Lamb.

117
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,940
And we begin to think this morning about the wonderful truth

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,619
that the Lord Jesus Christ paid for my sins,

119
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:59,459
and He offered me the gift of God,

120
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,660
which is eternal life, understanding that I was a sinner,

121
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,500
and that I was bound for a Christless eternity,

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,700
and that He was the only Savior.

123
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,380
I placed my faith and trust in the finished work

124
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,339
of Christ at Calvary, understanding that He died

125
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,820
according to the scriptures, that He was buried,

126
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,980
and He rose according to the scriptures,

127
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,179
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

128
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,940
And what a joy to know the truth of salvation,

129
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,619
and understanding this morning of being born again

130
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:34,299
on that particular day, August 31st, 1997 for me,

131
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,220
I was born of God.

132
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,579
In fact, John says it this way in John chapter number one,

133
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,660
notice, you hold your place there in 1 John,

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,540
but notice in John chapter number one,

135
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,540
we're very familiar and often would quote verse number 12,

136
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,980
and rightly so, a great verse of scripture,

137
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,260
but in John chapter number one, the Bible says this,

138
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,420
and John the Baptist, of course, giving testimony here,

139
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,179
and all that's taking place,

140
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,059
and being the forerunner of Christ,

141
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,140
but notice, if you will, in verse number 12

142
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,739
of John chapter number one, the gospel of John,

143
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:09,100
one in verse number 12, but as many as received Him,

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,380
to them gave He power to become the sons of God,

145
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,019
even to them that believe on His name.

146
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,619
Notice what it says, which were born,

147
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,339
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,

148
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,179
nor the will of man, but of God, born of God.

149
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,739
You see it in verse number 13,

150
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,059
and we find that John's writing about that truth

151
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:33,059
of being born of God, again, being a child of the King.

152
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,779
Think about that, the God of the universe is our Father.

153
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,779
He's my God, He's my Lord, what a joy.

154
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,500
This morning, as we think about being born of God,

155
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,820
and we think about the life of a believer,

156
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,980
as I mentioned a moment ago,

157
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,339
there ought to be evidences in our lives

158
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,420
that we've been born again.

159
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,380
Brother Jeff said this last night during the teen rally,

160
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,019
he said that he's been emphasizing this

161
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,339
during the teen class on Wednesday evening,

162
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,859
that we're different,

163
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,220
and things that are different are not the same,

164
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,420
and things that are the same are not different,

165
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,739
but we're different, amen?

166
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:17,299
And what a joy, and we look at this,

167
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,339
I've titled the message this morning simply this,

168
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,739
the life of a believer, the life of a believer.

169
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:24,940
As we look at these five verses,

170
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,260
I believe that God gives us three areas

171
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,779
in which we can look at characteristics, if you will,

172
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,899
of how God's people are to live.

173
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,299
Number one, if you're taking notes,

174
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,820
as we look at verse number one,

175
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,420
God's people are to live in love.

176
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,059
In fact, we find that Paul says this in Ephesians 5,

177
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,940
that we're to walk in love,

178
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,579
and we find that the subject matter of love

179
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,260
has been repeated throughout the book of 1 John.

180
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,619
We know that John refers to himself in the gospel of John

181
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,739
as the one whom the Lord loved,

182
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:59,059
and we find that he understood the love of God,

183
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,059
he experienced the love of God.

184
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:05,899
It is this human penman that penned that very familiar,

185
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,980
I should say probably one of the most known verses

186
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,980
of all the Bible, for God so loved the world

187
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,540
that he gave his only begotten son

188
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

189
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,899
but have everlasting life,

190
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,779
and John knew something about the love of God,

191
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,859
and John loved the Lord,

192
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:27,420
and we find that God's people are to live in love,

193
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,459
and we find that as we look at verse number one

194
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,419
here of 1 John chapter number five,

195
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,940
it says this, whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ,

196
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,400
Jesus, they would be familiar with the person Jesus

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,739
in his ministry, and he is the Christ,

198
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,780
that he is the Messiah, he's the promised one,

199
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,900
he's fulfilled, that he is God in flesh,

200
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,820
and whosoever believeth that truth is born of God.

201
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,820
By the way, if you don't believe that Jesus is God,

202
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,840
you've gotten it wrong,

203
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,880
and there's no salvation apart from Jesus.

204
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,440
There's no other name under heaven given among men

205
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
whereby we must be saved,

206
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,640
and that holy and precious and wonderful name is Jesus.

207
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,919
There's just something about that name.

208
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,760
The sweetest name I know, the songwriter said,

209
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,400
and here we find that John continues and says

210
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
that everyone that's been born of God,

211
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,159
and everyone that loveth him that begat,

212
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,320
and so we begin, I'll pause there just for a moment,

213
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,719
we think about God's people are to live in love,

214
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,719
we find that we first love the Redeemer,

215
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,619
we love the one who died for us,

216
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,280
we understand, we've studied it in chapter number four,

217
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,119
that we love him because he first loved us.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,760
What a joy to know the love of God.

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,719
What a joy to have and to walk in love,

220
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,359
and to have that love for our Savior.

221
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,280
But if we love the Redeemer,

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
then we ought to also love the...

223
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,200
The end of verse 1, it says this, everyone that loveth Him that begat, the Redeemer,

224
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
loveth Him also that is begotten of Him.

225
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm thankful for the redeemed.

226
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Amen?

227
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,600
I mean, I'm thankful for the Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, but then we think about

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,480
the redeemed, the brothers and sisters in Christ as we sit here as a local assembly,

229
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,120
a church, and we find that there are churches that are meeting that have redeemed people

230
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,920
and we begin to think about loving not only the Redeemer but loving the redeemed.

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,120
Philemon is given this testimony and it's a powerful testimony, just a short book in

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,080
the New Testament, one chapter, and here's what Paul says about Philemon, he says, hearing

233
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,760
of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all saints.

234
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,000
We love the Lord, we love the saints.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,760
This morning, God's people are to live in love.

236
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,960
What was it that Jesus said?

237
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,520
And I know it's been a recurring statement or a recurring theme throughout the book of

238
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,760
1 John, but I just read this week, I've been meditating on the book of John, preparing

239
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,320
for the trip and all that's going on, just meditating on the book of John.

240
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,380
And I was meditating there again in that 13th chapter, just I think it was on Friday as

241
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,340
I was looking in that 13th chapter and Jesus made that statement about loving one another

242
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,060
and He says, by this, by your love one for another, shall all men know that you're my

243
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,540
disciples.

244
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,460
The church in Corinth had a problem.

245
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:45,660
There was envy, there was division, fighting, all sorts of things going on.

246
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:52,320
We find that you come to that 13th chapter and He talks about charity, love, the great

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,480
chapter dealing with love in the New Testament.

248
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,480
We find that we're to love the Lord and we're to love the people of God, the Redeemer and

249
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
the redeemed.

250
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,160
Not only are we to live in love, but notice as we continue looking here in 1 John 5, look

251
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,780
at verses 2 and 3, God's people are to live in obedience.

252
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,000
Live in obedience.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,880
The Bible says this, by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God.

254
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,400
And the next words say this, and keep His commandments.

255
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,220
Mentioned this morning in our Sunday school hour as we're studying through the miracles

256
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,360
of the Lord Jesus Christ and we got to John chapter 21 and dealing with those disciples,

257
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,680
Peter influencing the others to go fishing and they had a long night where they caught

258
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,640
nothing and Jesus shows up and Jesus asks that question, children, have ye any meat?

259
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,560
Listen, when you've not caught anything all night, that's the last question you want someone

260
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
to ask you.

261
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,080
And they learned that in Sunday school as well and they had to answer by saying no,

262
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,160
but they knew not that it was the Lord at that point.

263
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:07,000
And Jesus gave them instruction, cast the net on the right side of the ship and you

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
shall find.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
That's what He told them in John 21.

266
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,200
We dealt with it in Sunday school this morning and I said this, number one, I'm thankful

267
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,360
that God gave instruction, amen?

268
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm thankful that the disciples obeyed the instruction.

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,720
They could have cast the net on the left side of the ship.

270
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,960
That would have been problematic because God said the right side.

271
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,320
They could have determined that we've toiled all the night and we've taken nothing.

272
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
There's no need to cast a net.

273
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,000
Sometimes we disobey the simple instruction that God gives.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,120
You know the reality is that there was nothing complex or complicated about the instruction

275
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,840
that Jesus gave to the disciples in John 21.

276
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Cast the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find.

277
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,080
It was pretty simple, amen?

278
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,720
But they followed the simple instruction and they had a miraculous catch.

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,080
It's amazing.

280
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,920
You know, when we obey God, the life of a believer should be marked by obedience.

281
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,440
When we go to the Word of God, we find that God has given us the instruction.

282
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Why?

283
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
Because He loves us.

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,560
And as He loves us, He gives us this instruction so that we can know how we can live our lives

285
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,840
and lead our lives in such a way that it's pleasing to Him.

286
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm thankful as we look to the Word of God, and I understand this morning that we're living

287
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,160
in a time and a culture where so many are looking at the Word of God and they're being

288
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,800
critical and they're saying, oh, the Bible's just a whole book of list of do's and don'ts

289
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,240
and all these rules and so on and so forth.

290
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,560
But I stand and I say, I'm thankful that God gave us the instruction.

291
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm thankful.

292
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,240
Listen, I'm going to stand before God one day and so are you, and it'd be a sad thing

293
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,280
to stand before God and never know what He really expected, amen?

294
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,000
But God said, you're going to stand before Me, He's the judge, and we're going to stand

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
before Him.

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,880
And He said, here's how you live your life.

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,940
It changes the whole perspective of just being a rule book to being these are the guidance,

298
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,260
this is the guidance, the divine instruction that my heavenly Father has given me because

299
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,940
He loves me and He wants me to walk in obedience.

300
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,380
He says this truth of obedience of keeping His commandments is marked for us twice here

301
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,640
in this passage of Scripture.

302
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,700
In verse number two, it says this, when we love God and keep His commandments.

303
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,060
In verse number three, for this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments and

304
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,140
His commandments are not grievous.

305
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,540
Listen, when you try to keep the commandments in your own power, if someone tries to keep

306
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,140
the commandments and they're not saved, they're not born again, they don't have the Spirit

307
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,940
of God living within them, it becomes grievous.

308
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,220
It really does.

309
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,940
But when the Holy Spirit of God lives within you and you understand who He is, His commandments

310
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,900
are not grievous.

311
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:09,060
He said this, Jesus said this in John 14 in verse number 15, if you love Me, keep My commandments.

312
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,320
Again, just as there's a very popular idea today that the Bible is full of a list of

313
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,340
do's and don'ts and so on and so forth, and there's some that are running around saying

314
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,500
that they love Jesus but they're not obeying God.

315
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Well, God said, if you love Me, keep My commandments.

316
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,620
And this is the evidence that you love Me is that you keep My commandments.

317
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,140
See, we can say anything we want to say.

318
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,300
If someone said, talk is cheap, it really is.

319
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,980
You can say whatever you want.

320
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,500
But where's the evidence?

321
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,180
I think about it this way.

322
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,300
Michael, if we went to a court of law, would there be enough evidence against us to find

323
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,620
us guilty of being a Christian, of loving God?

324
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,760
Would there be enough evidence to bring a guilty verdict?

325
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
That person's guilty.

326
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,320
They love Jesus.

327
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
That person's guilty.

328
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,080
They've spent time with Jesus.

329
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,680
You know what they said of Peter and the others, John in particular, there in Acts chapter

330
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,640
number 4, when Peter stands up and he gives that great answer to those that are criticizing

331
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,920
and attacking and threatening, and he stands and he gives that great truth with regard

332
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,560
to the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and salvation only being through His name.

333
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:36,600
They take note and they say, these are ignorant and unlearned men, but they've been with Jesus.

334
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,680
It was evident.

335
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
It was obvious.

336
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,160
They'd spent time with the Lord.

337
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,880
I want you to think about this, this truth of living in obedience.

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,800
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, in Psalm chapter 19, Psalm chapter 19.

339
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,160
And I want to look at just a couple of passages here.

340
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,800
When I think about living in obedience, listen, I've mentioned already, but we ought to be

341
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,400
thankful for God's instruction.

342
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,960
I mean, when I think about the Word of God, I am so thankful that God has given me the

343
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
instruction.

344
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Oh, it's a joy to read about the attributes of God and the power of God and the miracles

345
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,320
of God, and to look at the truth that God loves me and all of those wonderful things

346
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,240
about heaven and eternity and so on and so forth.

347
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,360
But the reality is I'm thankful for every verse in this book.

348
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm thankful for the verses that tell me what I ought not to do.

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,640
And I'm thankful for the verses that tell me what I should be doing.

350
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,000
And we find that the psalmist says this in Psalm 19, in verse number 7, the law of the

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,840
Lord is perfect, converting the soul.

352
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,920
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

353
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,720
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

354
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,660
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

355
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,120
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

356
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,840
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

357
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Notice what he says.

358
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,840
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey

359
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,040
and the honeycomb.

360
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Why does he say that?

361
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Why does he conclude that in verse number 10?

362
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,600
Well, because of everything he said in verses 7 through 9 when he understood what the Word

363
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
of God was, he says, I want this.

364
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,560
I want the Word of God.

365
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,680
It's to be desired by us, and I want it more than gold.

366
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Spiritual people are seeking wealth.

367
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,600
They would pursue and desire wealth, and they'd be willing to do just about anything some

368
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
people would to get wealth.

369
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,320
But, oh, we ought to long for the Word of God.

370
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,400
Let me...hold your place there in Psalm 19, but let me just tell you what the psalmist

371
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,920
says in Psalm 119, in verse number 162.

372
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,280
You might want to jot the verse down.

373
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,260
But the psalmist says this in Psalm 119 and 162, I rejoice at thy word, and then he gives

374
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,460
us an analogy, a picture to help us understand how he's rejoicing.

375
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,300
He says, I rejoice at thy word.

376
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,980
Lord, as one that findeth great spoil."

377
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,340
I want you to think about the person that finds great spoil.

378
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,580
I mean, they're excited, they're rejoicing, they're thankful, and the psalmist says,

379
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,940
with that same level of rejoicing, I rejoice at Thy word.

380
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,740
Oh, when you approached the Word of God this morning, were you rejoicing and thanking God

381
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,700
that He gave you the Bible?

382
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,620
Notice he says in verse number 11 of Psalm 19, after he makes the declaration of what

383
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,860
the Word of God is and what it has the power to do, and the fact that it's to be desired

384
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,660
more than gold, it's sweeter than honey in the honeycomb, he says, moreover, by them

385
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,100
is thy servant warned.

386
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm thankful for the warnings, and in keeping of them, obeying them, is great reward.

387
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,020
Now think about warnings.

388
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,220
You're familiar with warnings, we're all familiar with warnings.

389
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,600
No doubt you have products in your home that have warning labels on them.

390
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,780
Those warning labels are there to warn you of danger.

391
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,020
We drive and there are warnings that are posted on the road that were to take heed to those

392
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,060
warnings.

393
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,660
The fact of the matter is that there are times in which we do not take heed to the warning

394
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,500
and we suffer the consequences.

395
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:32,340
I remember reading years ago about a pastor and his wife, actually, who had left the church

396
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,660
after a Sunday service and were in a hurry to get somewhere, and they came to a crossing

397
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,060
of a train track crossing, a railroad crossing.

398
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,020
When they came to that place, the lights were flashing and the bars were down.

399
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,100
Now is that a warning?

400
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,340
I'm sure it is.

401
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,580
But that man decided that he had enough time to cross those tracks, and he went around

402
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,260
the first, tried to get around the second, and the train hit them and they went into

403
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,940
eternity.

404
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,020
God's given us His Word as a warning.

405
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,540
By them is thy servant warned.

406
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:19,300
But then He says this, and in keeping of them, there is great reward.

407
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
It's precious.

408
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,620
Oh, it causes us to rejoice.

409
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,180
We think about walking or living in obedience, we're to be thankful for the instruction,

410
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,100
I would say this also, we must be disciplined to know His Word.

411
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,420
See this morning, and I know this is a super simple, basic truth, but I cannot keep His

412
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,700
Word if I do not know His Word.

413
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,600
Have you ever been in a position, ever been in a place, Brother Mark probably got this

414
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,940
all the time when he would pull somebody over and they said, well, I didn't know.

415
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,380
I didn't see that speed limit sign back there, right?

416
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,900
I didn't know that that was the…

417
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:00,140
Listen, I can't keep something I don't know, and if I ignore this book, if I neglect

418
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:08,340
this book, then all the precious truth that God has given me that He expects me to have,

419
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,300
the warnings, the teaching of His Word, the instruction, then if I'm not disciplined

420
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,260
to know His Word, if I'm not studying to show myself approved unto God, a workman

421
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,140
that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth, if I'm not searching

422
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,900
the Scriptures, if I'm not a student of the Word, then how am I to obey the instruction

423
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,620
that God's given?

424
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,860
So we must be disciplined to know the Word of God, and I would say this, we must be committed

425
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,160
to obedience, committed to obedience.

426
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,680
The reality is that as we study the Word of God, it is not appropriate for us to take

427
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,120
a penknife or a sharpie, magic marker, and just mark out the portions of Scripture that

428
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,240
just don't align with what we want to do.

429
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,000
As you get into the next text of Scripture in the book of 1 John in the 5th chapter,

430
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
you find that it refers to the record that had been given.

431
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
This Bible stands as a whole.

432
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,720
It's not to pick and choose what you want and what fits your desires.

433
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Amen?

434
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,440
It's an all-or-nothing kind of a situation.

435
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,900
And we take the Word of God, and as we have that commitment to obedience, we approach

436
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,940
the Word of God by saying, God, this is Your Word, God, You're holy, You're omniscient,

437
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,920
You know everything, You've given it to me as a benefit, You've given it to me as a warning,

438
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,640
the keeping of them is great reward, thank You for Your instruction, and make the commitment

439
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,520
to obey.

440
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,520
How sad it is to not follow instructions.

441
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,360
Have you ever been in a situation where you didn't follow the instructions?

442
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,160
And someone says, well, you didn't follow the instructions.

443
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,600
And then you do not have the desired result for the simple fact that you didn't follow

444
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,920
the instructions.

445
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,080
The instructions were given for a purpose.

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Now, some of you, maybe like me, sometimes I take the instructions and I discard them.

447
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,560
You ever do that?

448
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,400
You think you know how to do something.

449
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,760
You think you know how to, I've done this before.

450
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,940
I shared the illustration over a year ago, and it helped Brother Ron sharing the illustration

451
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,400
from the pulpit of installing a ceiling fan.

452
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,440
I've installed lots of ceiling fans.

453
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm not an electrician, but I've installed lots of ceiling fans.

454
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,760
And so I was on number five or something like that in our house when we moved in, and I

455
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,320
thought I got this.

456
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
And the instructions said to do something as the next step, and I said, that doesn't

457
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
make any sense.

458
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,560
I've never done it that way before.

459
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,360
So guess what I wanted to do with the instructions?

460
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,160
I wanted to set them to the side and say that's, I don't know who wrote those instructions,

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
but they did it wrong.

462
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,200
That's what I said.

463
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,320
Joseph was helping me, man, and I'm like, these guys don't know what they're doing.

464
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,760
They got their numbers out of order.

465
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,160
It's a mess.

466
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,680
How in the world would you put the blades on first before you connect?

467
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,960
You're never going to be able to reach up there.

468
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,480
I mean, that was a mess.

469
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,400
And then I got to thinking, you know, maybe these engineers know something I don't know.

470
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
And they are the ones that designed it, and maybe the instructions, maybe it would be

471
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,080
good for me to follow the instructions.

472
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,520
And then I followed the instructions, and we have a ceiling fan in our living room that

473
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,440
works.

474
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,720
Had I discarded them like I wanted to, I would have had to go back and find them and

475
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
start over because it would not have worked.

476
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:48,480
You know what's interesting to me is sometimes in basic life, just everyday routine life,

477
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,920
we follow instructions and give no thought as to why we have to do it the way that it

478
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
has to be done.

479
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,960
But sometimes when it comes to God's instruction, we oppose it.

480
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
Now, He's the God of the universe.

481
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,600
He created you and He created me, and He knows what's best for us.

482
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,920
And so when He says, do it this way, there's a reason.

483
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,640
I mean, I'll use a really simple illustration this morning.

484
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,000
And I know not all of us have keys for our ignition in our cars because now they got

485
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,480
those push-button things, all right?

486
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,600
So if you have a push-button thing, do you still know about a key and an ignition, all

487
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
right?

488
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,280
Brother Michael, you know about keys and ignitions, amen?

489
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,880
And last time I used a blue light special Kmart illustration, we had some folks that

490
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
didn't know.

491
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,640
I was too old for that.

492
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,520
But you put the key in the ignition, right?

493
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,080
And so when you think about driving, if you go out in the parking lot this afternoon after

494
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,280
church and get in your car to leave, the first thing that you're going to do is not

495
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,640
put your car in drive.

496
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Why not?

497
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
It's not going to work.

498
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,200
This is not going to work.

499
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,720
You have to put the key in the ignition, and you have to turn the key.

500
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,400
Then you have to depress your brake.

501
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,120
My car won't let me go out of gear if I don't push my brake.

502
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,080
It won't.

503
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:33,560
So I could sit in my car all afternoon and say, I don't like this, and I'm not going

504
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,900
to do it that way.

505
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,380
And guess how far I'm going to get?

506
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,560
I don't want to push the brake.

507
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm not going anywhere, right?

508
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
You don't even think about it.

509
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,160
We just go in the car, and the design of the car is that there's a sequence, and this is

510
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,840
what you have to do in this order before you're going to drive, right?

511
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,560
And we just do it.

512
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Why?

513
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,000
Because we're going to drive when we get somewhere.

514
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You have appliances.

515
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You have computers.

516
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,440
Who ever thought about the control-alt-delete thing, right?

517
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
And I mentioned that to Jared once, and he gave me some long explanation as to why it's

518
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
control-alt-delete.

519
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
So for you IT guys, I heard it once.

520
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,920
I don't remember it, but I understand there's some reason for it.

521
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,880
But you start thinking about it, and people say, well, that's just what you have to do.

522
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,680
And you follow it.

523
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,020
But when we come to the omniscient God, who is the one who created us, and He loved us

524
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,800
enough to give us a book that contains not only who He is in the plan of redemption,

525
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,940
but provides instruction for our lives, why do we resist it?

526
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,140
Why do we say, no, that might be for you, but that's just not really for me?

527
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:05,140
The life of a believer is to be marked by obedience.

528
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,740
It's to be marked by love, but it's to be marked by obedience.

529
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,020
We make that commitment, James 1 and verse number 22 tells us that we're to be doers

530
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,480
of the Word and not hearers only.

531
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,660
That we're to take and apply the truth of God in our hearts and our lives, and that

532
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,820
we understand that there's one God, and He created us, and He loves us, and He's given

533
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,160
us the truth, and I'm so thankful for it.

534
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,400
Back to 1 John, and we'll finish with this.

535
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,260
The life of a believer is to be marked by love, to be marked by obedience, to be marked

536
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,100
by victory.

537
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,180
God's people, number three, are to live in victory.

538
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:53,460
Aren't you so thankful for the victory that we have through the Lord Jesus Christ?

539
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,540
The Bible says this in verse number four, as we look at our text of Scripture in 1 John

540
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,380
5, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh

541
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,360
the world, even our faith.

542
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,580
We sing the hymn, we didn't sing it this morning, faith is the victory.

543
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,540
Where did the songwriter get that idea from, 1 John 5 and verse number four?

544
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,660
Faith is the victory that overcomes the world.

545
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,620
Remember what John said in 1 John 4 and verse number four, you're of God, little children,

546
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,740
and have overcome them, why?

547
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,580
Because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.

548
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:38,600
Oh, the one that's in the world, the enemy, Satan, he has great power.

549
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,820
But one little word will fell him, we just sang about that this morning.

550
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,900
The reality is that we've been given the shield of faith which will quench all the fiery darts

551
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,300
of the wicked one, is what the Bible tells us in the book of Ephesians, and we've been

552
00:31:52,300 --> 00:32:00,180
given the sword of the Spirit, where to use the Word of God, and we can have that victory.

553
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,180
We begin to think about victory, and we understand this morning that our God is victorious, that

554
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:12,380
He always wins, He's never failed, He's never been defeated, He never will be, He is the

555
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,220
Lord God omnipotent, and He reigns.

556
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Forevermore.

557
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Amen?

558
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,020
There are times when we look at this world and we see things that are going on, and we

559
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,260
might sit back and we might be deceived for a moment, and say, what is going on?

560
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,740
God knows what's going on, and God's in control, and according to Psalm 2, though the heathen

561
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,180
rage, God is in control.

562
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,800
He rules and He reigns, and He's victorious.

563
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,420
We find that the Bible told us, we mentioned in 1 John 4 and verse number 4, but notice

564
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,180
in 1 John 3 and verse number 8, we were reminded of this several months ago as we studied this

565
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,700
portion of Scripture.

566
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,700
The Bible says this in 1 John 3 and verse 8, he that committed the sins of the devil,

567
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,100
for the devil sinneth from the beginning, for this purpose the Son of God was manifested,

568
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,020
that he might destroy the works of the devil.

569
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,980
The Bible tells us this in the book of Colossians in chapter 2 and verse number 15, and I really

570
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,420
appreciate the understanding of this verse of Scripture in looking at what would be given

571
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,740
to us here with regard to the victory at the cross of Calvary.

572
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,140
The Bible says, I'll look at it in verse 14 and 15 of Colossians 2, blotting out the handwriting

573
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,540
of ordinances that was against us.

574
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,060
Whew, man, we were guilty.

575
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,820
We're guilty.

576
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,180
It was contrary to us, but the Bible says, took it out of the way, nailing it to His

577
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
cross.

578
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,060
Aren't you so thankful?

579
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,820
We sing that great song.

580
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:54,620
We think about the words that were sung on that day, that man that lost his family on

581
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,660
that ship and all that had taken place.

582
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:08,300
My sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more.

583
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,780
Isn't that a wonderful, wonderful portion of that song?

584
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,660
I love that verse.

585
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:21,540
He continues in verse number 15, and having spoiled principalities and powers, notice

586
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:28,940
what it says, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

587
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,220
In the era in which the Scriptures were written and for many centuries before and after, when

588
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:42,100
a conquering king would defeat a rival, they would parade the rival in front of the people

589
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,580
that they led to show their power.

590
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,020
And here the Bible says that He, Christ, He spoiled principalities and powers and He made

591
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,060
a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

592
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:01,660
Hebrews tells us this, in Hebrews 2, in verse number 14, speaking about the victory of our

593
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,140
Lord Jesus Christ, He says this, for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh

594
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,940
and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same, that through death He might destroy

595
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,940
him that had the power of death, that is the devil.

596
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:26,060
See our God is victorious, and because He is victorious, we too can live in victory.

597
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,500
Listen, we don't have to live defeated lives.

598
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,460
Let me say it this way, we shouldn't live defeated lives.

599
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,500
We serve a conquering king.

600
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,140
We serve the God who's always been victorious, and we do not need to live in defeat, we do

601
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,620
not need to live being defeated and feeling like we're overcome.

602
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,900
We are overcomers.

603
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,460
We are more than conquerors, Romans 8 and verse number 37 tells us.

604
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:02,060
And I'm reminded of the great truth of 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 57, but thanks be to God,

605
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,620
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

606
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:13,460
This morning, God's people are to live in victory, live in victory.

607
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,940
Conquerors of yesteryear would say this often, I've read the back of the book and we win.

608
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,180
I've read the back of the book and we win.

609
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,540
Listen, we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.

610
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,060
Faith is the victory, and as the people of God were to be living in victory, listen,

611
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,860
we have the Holy Spirit of God lives within us.

612
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,920
The powerful Word of God has been given to us.

613
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,860
The Bible says of the power of this book, we can read it in the book of Jeremiah, we

614
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,100
can read it in the book of Hebrews, we can read it in so many other portions of Scripture

615
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,140
about the power of God's Word.

616
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,620
The gospel is the power of God unto salvation, the Bible tells us in the book of Romans.

617
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,300
We think about the power of the Holy Spirit of God, but you shall receive power after

618
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,300
that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, Acts 1 and verse number 8.

619
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,100
And we are to live in victory.

620
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:20,600
As I begin to think about really the summary, if you will, as maybe review that John is

621
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,460
giving as he enters into this final chapter of the book of 1 John, and he's mentioned

622
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,500
so many things and so many wonderful truths have been provided to us here in the book

623
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,660
of 1 John, and he comes to the first several verses of the fifth chapter, and he says,

624
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,980
let me remind you of the behavior of those that have been born of God.

625
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,460
Those that have been saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, their lives are to

626
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,100
be marked by love.

627
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,980
They're to live in love.

628
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,820
Loving the Redeemer and loving the redeemed.

629
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,620
Their lives are to be marked by obedience.

630
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,940
If you love me, keep my commandments.

631
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,860
These commandments are not grievous.

632
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:10,980
We find that the life of a believer is to be marked by victory, that we're walking in

633
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,300
the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

634
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
We're experiencing victory.

635
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,620
I love that song, Victory in Jesus.

636
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Victory in Jesus.

637
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:27,260
Listen, the truth of God's Word is that the arm of flesh will fail you.

638
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,020
The Bible says, Paul says this, I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good

639
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
thing.

640
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,820
Oh, wretched man that I am, is what Paul says.

641
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,220
Jesus said, without me you can do nothing.

642
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:46,940
But we find that there is victory in Christ, and we can rejoice, and we ought to have lives

643
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,220
that are marked by victory.

644
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:57,860
I never had the privilege of hearing Him in person.

645
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,060
Curtis Hudson went home to be with the Lord well before I ever trusted Christ as my Savior.

646
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:09,300
It's my understanding that Curtis Hudson would often preach and just begin singing the end

647
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,740
of a message often.

648
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,340
He would sing this song, I'm on the winning side.

649
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,660
I'm not going to sing for you this morning because you all leave and it'd be a problem.

650
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,900
But I do want to read to you the words of that song.

651
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,500
It's not in our song book.

652
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
We sing it occasionally.

653
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,420
Brother Dan Hummel is probably one of his favorite songs.

654
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,020
He loves singing that song.

655
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,240
And I am, and you are on the winning side.

656
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,160
I'm on the winning side.

657
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,220
Once I drifted out in sin, had no hope or joy within.

658
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,560
And my soul was burdened down with pride, with sinful pride.

659
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,200
Then my Savior came along and He showed me I was wrong.

660
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,160
Now I know I'm on the winning side.

661
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
The songwriter continued to sing.

662
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
And I am, and you are on the winning side.

663
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Then my Savior came along and He showed me I was wrong.

664
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,160


665
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,520
say from the straight and narrow way I was drifting every day, out upon the waters deep

666
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,480
and wide, so deep and wide, but all is over now, glory light is on my brow, and my soul

667
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,000
is on the winning side.

668
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,160
I will never have a fear for my Lord is ever near, and in Him so often I confide, and Him

669
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,440
confide.

670
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,840
He's the keeper of my soul since I gave Him full control, and He placed me on the winning

671
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
side.

672
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,600
Well, I am on the winning side, yes, I am on the winning side.

673
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,760
Out in sin no more will I abide, I've enlisted in the fight for the cause of truth and right.

674
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,400
Praise the Lord, I'm on the winning side.

675
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:56,280
This morning, if you've been born of God, your life and my life ought to be characterized

676
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,640
by love, obedience, and victory.

677
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,080
In these five verses of Scripture, we see these three characteristics of those who have

678
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
been born of God.

679
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:14,560
And I hope this morning that we are demonstrating these things, that the evidence is there,

680
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:22,560
that as we go out into the midst of a perverse and crooked generation, that our lives stand

681
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,520
as a beacon of light, proclaiming there's something different about us.

682
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,840
And that difference is Jesus, because I've been born of God.

683
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Let's pray together.

684
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Father, we love You.

685
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,880
Oh, how we thank You for loving us.

686
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,320
I thank You for the Word of God.

687
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,440
I thank You for salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.

688
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,320
Thank You for saving my soul, for changing my life.

689
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,560
Thank You for the Holy Spirit of God who lives within.

690
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,880
Thank You for the Word of God that You've provided us with.

691
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,800
You've been so gracious to give us a Bible.

692
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,720
God, we thank You for salvation.

693
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,440
We pray that You'd help us to be like Christ.

694
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,840
I pray, Lord, that You'd help each one that's here this morning, that's trusted You as their

695
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:20,960
personal Lord and Savior, that they would live a life that's marked by love and obedience

696
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,440
and victory.

697
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,640
Lord, perhaps there's one present this morning that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

698
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,160
as their personal Savior.

699
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,240
They've never been born of God.

700
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,320
Oh, I pray that today they'd understand their need for Christ.

701
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,680
The Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness

702
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
and of judgment to come.

703
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,440
I pray that as we have a few moments of invitation this morning, Lord, I pray that You'd move

704
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,040
and work in the hearts of Your people as only You can.

705
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,600
We'll thank You for every decision, which in Christ's name we pray.

706
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,120
Would You stand with us?
