1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
I'm gonna preach our behavior in the workplace,

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,199
Colossians 3.

3
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:06,599
I'll preach it next week or the following, we'll see.

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,159
We have a baby dedication next week,

5
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,880
so we'll probably be preaching something different next week.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,039
But I'm so thankful, as I was praying this morning

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,300
and even thinking about that song

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,940
as I heard them practicing.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,200
Our Savior is coming again, amen.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,040
We live in the midst of chaos and confusion and turmoil

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,139
and people are living in fear

12
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:27,600
and all sorts of things are going on.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,280
But man, we are singing this morning

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
those songs that we sang about Jesus coming,

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
my cup's over run, right?

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,080
Oh, say, but I'm glad, why?

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,000
Because my sins are forgiven.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,220
But you know, the reality is that the story

19
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,099
of the Lord Jesus Christ, the truth of God's word,

20
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,720
as I mentioned, William Scroggie saying

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,560
that the Bible is the unfolding drama of redemption.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,919
You look in the Old Testament

23
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,240
and you find how the Lord, through the Old Testament,

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,080
is giving us types and pictures and prophecies

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,919
with regard to the coming of Messiah.

26
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,040
But you understand that the prophecies

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,080
that are contained within the Old Testament

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,080
are not strictly just isolated to His first coming.

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,400
In fact, there are many prophecies

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,440
with regard to His second coming.

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,860
And we find that when the fullness of time was come,

32
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,680
that God sent forth His Son, born of a virgin.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,519
Why?

34
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,680
For the purpose of dying on the cross of Calvary.

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,319
He was the Lamb that was slain

36
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,699
before the foundation of the world.

37
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,559
Why was it necessary?

38
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,360
Because if He didn't, we'd be lost forever.

39
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,319
We'd have to pay for our own sin.

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,279
Sin carries, listen, we're all sinners.

41
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,519
All have sin and come short of the glory of God.

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,160
And sin carries with it a penalty.

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,919
A payment must be made.

44
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm thankful that Jesus came the first time.

45
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,459
I'm thankful that when He came the first time,

46
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,360
He fulfilled that which He was to do.

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,879
I'm thankful that He declared on the cross of Calvary,

48
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,800
it is finished.

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,639
Amen?

50
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,839
And He was buried in a borrowed tomb,

51
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,839
and then He rose triumphantly,

52
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,480
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

53
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,239
But I want you to understand that in John 14,

54
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,759
before we ever get to the death,

55
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,899
the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ,

56
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,759
that Jesus, in this portion of Scripture,

57
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,080
is encouraging His followers, His disciples.

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,279
We find that it's in the 13th chapter of the book of John

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
that Jesus demonstrated and displayed for them

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,160
service and ministry and being a servant.

61
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,339
And of course, through washing the feet of the disciples,

62
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,899
He showed them, demonstrated for them,

63
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,639
the importance of being a servant.

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,460
We find that near the end of the 13th chapter

65
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,820
of the book of John, that Jesus is continuing

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,059
to reveal to them that soon He would go to the cross

67
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,600
and that He would die on that cross.

68
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,919
We understand that these men, as they walked with Him,

69
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,880
that as He began to reveal these things

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,720
and give them further insight as to all that was going on,

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,440
notice in chapter 13 and verse number 31 that Jesus,

72
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,479
He says, now is the Son of Man glorified

73
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,919
and God is glorified in Him.

74
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,600
How is this going to happen?

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
Well, if you read chapter 17,

76
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,520
you understand it was through going to the cross.

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,600
We find, no doubt, that the message

78
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,720
that had been received by these disciples

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
at the end of chapter 13 was a message

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,139
that brought them troubled hearts.

81
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,399
How do we know that?

82
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,080
Well, because Jesus begins John 14 and verse number one

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,080
by saying this, let not your heart be troubled.

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,679
Let not your heart be troubled.

85
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,880
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
And then He says this, in My Father's house

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,300
are many mansions.

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,320
If it were not so, I would have told you.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,399
And then notice where He says,

90
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,800
I go to prepare a place for you.

91
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,639
Now, I'm thankful that there are many things

92
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,160
that Jesus, after His ascension, is doing.

93
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,880
One of those things that He's doing

94
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,320
is He's making intercession for us, amen?

95
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,559
One of those things that He's doing

96
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:06,080
is He's our advocate, according to 1 John chapter number two,

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,179
and I'm thankful that He's our great high priest

98
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:12,759
and He is fulfilling those ministries.

99
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,720
But we find here in this passage of Scripture

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,359
that He says, I go to prepare a place for you.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,799
And as I think about this preparation,

102
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,519
we find that the text does not end there.

103
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,359
He says in verse number three, and if I go.

104
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,600
Now, He just told him He was going, right?

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,760
And then He says, if I go, He says,

106
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,359
and prepare a place for you.

107
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,359
Notice these words, I will come again.

108
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,440
I will come again and receive you unto Myself,

109
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
that where I am, there ye may be also.

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,040
Isn't that a precious promise of the Word of God?

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
If you're taking notes,

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,959
I just titled the message this morning,

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,440
I will come again.

114
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,239
I will come again.

115
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,720
We understand the interactions

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,079
that we have humanly speaking in our relationships

117
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,200
and times in which we'll depart,

118
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,119
we'll go maybe just to the store,

119
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,359
maybe to the office, maybe we go on a business trip,

120
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,480
whatever it may be, and we'll say,

121
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,519
we'll see you when we get back.

122
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,160
The idea of that statement is that you're planning

123
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,239
to return, now we know and we understand,

124
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:21,079
we can read accounts and stories of those that never returned.

125
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,040
They did not ever complete that which was to be completed.

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
They never returned, why?

127
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,559
Because death knocked upon their door

128
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,079
and they never were able to return.

129
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,600
But I want you to understand something

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
about the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ

131
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
when He says to His disciples, I will come again,

132
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,359
the reality, if you're taking notes,

133
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,519
just think about this, the simplicity of the promise.

134
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,239
This is a simple promise.

135
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,880
There's nothing that's complex about the promise

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,279
that we find here in John chapter number 14,

137
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,440
but man, this is a wonderful promise.

138
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,640
And we think about the way in which God gives us

139
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,720
in His word these wonderful promises

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,079
and Peter will refer to them as exceeding great

141
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,079
and precious promises.

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,839
We consider the simplicity of this promise

143
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,920
and he says, I will come again.

144
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,779
And we understand that throughout the word of God,

145
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,519
you will be sure of this one thing

146
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,000
that God always does what He says He will do.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,679
Always.

148
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,880
He says, I will come again,

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,519
you can guarantee that He's going to return.

150
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,200
There are many people in our land,

151
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
there are many people throughout history

152
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,760
that have sought to make commitments

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
and to give some sort of a word to someone

154
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,440
and make some type of promise

155
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,600
that they were not in of themselves able to fulfill.

156
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,720
But I want you to understand that God Almighty

157
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,799
is able to fulfill everything that He's ever said.

158
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,640
And when He says, I will come again,

159
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,799
that ought to bring great hope and great joy

160
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
to the heart of every child of God.

161
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,760
The reality is that Paul, as he's speaking

162
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,279
and ministering to Titus,

163
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,119
he says that we're looking for that blessed hope

164
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,720
and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,440
the Lord Jesus Christ.

166
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
We understand something about that word hope.

167
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,320
It's not the context in which oftentimes today

168
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,000
we use the word hope.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Today we use the word hope as just a wishful type of thing

170
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,920
I hope this is going to happen.

171
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,399
I hope that's going to happen.

172
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,720
No, no, biblical hope is something that is based upon,

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,079
founded upon, secured on what God says.

174
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,160
It is an expectation.

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,480
I believe that the simplicity of this promise

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,320
will bring confidence to every child of God.

177
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,160
You think about the confidence that we have

178
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,279
that one day, even as they sang that song this morning,

179
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,000
listen, Jesus is coming again and we don't know the hour,

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
we don't know the day,

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,239
but we're to live with a level of confidence,

182
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:49,279
understanding that our God rules and reigns

183
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,519
and He is in control.

184
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,160
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

185
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,640
And oh, when He comes,

186
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,679
what a glorious day that'll be.

187
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,279
Many over the years,

188
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,559
I know Brother Mershon uses the phraseology often,

189
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,559
I'm not looking for the undertaker,

190
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,839
I'm looking for the upper taker.

191
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,559
I'm looking for, listening for that trumpet, amen?

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,079
The song, I think it was that second verse

193
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,880
as they sang this morning that special about,

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
I can almost hear the father say,

195
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,399
son, go get your children, right?

196
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,839
Listening for that trumpet,

197
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,040
I don't know who it was that wrote the song,

198
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,279
listen for the trumpet.

199
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,480
I know the first time I ever heard it, Ron Hamilton,

200
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,359
I'm not sure if he wrote that song,

201
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,799
but I heard him sing that song.

202
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,760
And oh, how we're to listen for the trumpet

203
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,559
because it will sound and the dead in Christ

204
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,119
shall be raised, will be changed, amen?

205
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,159
And you think about the confidence that we have

206
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,840
as we live life and we understand

207
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
that our Savior is coming again.

208
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,599
Think about these disciples

209
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:51,119
that had hearts that were troubled, troubled hearts.

210
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,840
What do we need in the midst of turmoil and trouble?

211
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,119
We need a word that will bring confidence,

212
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,919
a word that will bring calm,

213
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,520
a word that will bring assurance.

214
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,679
And we find that Jesus gave just that word.

215
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,520
He said, listen, I understand that your hearts are troubled

216
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
but let not your heart be troubled.

217
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,559
And He then gives them this wonderful promise

218
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,640
about His departure.

219
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
Of course, later He would give them other insights

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,080
with regard to His need to go to the cross of Calvary.

221
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,719
He said that it's expedient for you that I go.

222
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:24,719
It was necessary, it was advantageous

223
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:27,440
that He go to the cross of Calvary for human beings.

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,599
And we understand all that was accomplished.

225
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:34,400
But when He made that statement, I will come again.

226
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,280
I want you to consider the impact

227
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,760
that those words would have upon the disciples

228
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,880
and the impact that those words ought to have

229
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,479
upon you and upon me.

230
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,520
We think about the simplicity of the promise

231
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,359
that brings confidence,

232
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,520
but it brings a measure of expectation.

233
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,799
It brings a measure of expectation.

234
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,200
I wonder this morning,

235
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,559
I wonder as we go through life,

236
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,840
I wonder how often we are...

237
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm mindful of the fact that Jesus may come back today.

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I preached a message two Sunday mornings ago

239
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,080
about being ready for revival,

240
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,180
and I spoke about the statement

241
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,480
that often the question that will be asked,

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,920
are you ready?

243
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
And I said this in that message by way of introduction,

244
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,480
that the question requires context.

245
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,800
Am I ready for what?

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,120
Well, this morning, I asked the question

247
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,600
within the context of the Lord's return.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Are you ready?

249
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,080
It would be wonderful if He came

250
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
before I got done preaching this morning.

251
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,120
I mean, seriously.

252
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
Those guys up there in Pennsylvania

253
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
that are expecting me to come and preach,

254
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
I don't think they'd be upset for one second.

255
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
Why? Because we'd be with the Lord.

256
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
It'd be awesome, amen?

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,400
Listen, He could come at any moment,

258
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
and the question that we must ask ourselves this morning

259
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,520
is are we ready?

260
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,680
The expectation that this promise gives.

261
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
I mean, think about the disciples

262
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,040
when they're hearing this message,

263
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,040
and they're receiving this simple promise

264
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
that Jesus says, I will come again.

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
Well, when?

266
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
We understand that in Acts,

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
they begin to inquire,

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,120
and they want to know when He's going to set up His kingdom.

269
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,760
Turn over, in fact, to Acts 1,

270
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,320
and I want you to notice what is said

271
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
in this passage of Scripture,

272
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,480
and this is after the death and burial

273
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,600
and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

274
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,160
It's after He made Himself known to those,

275
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,040
and it made many appearances

276
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,340
by many infallible proofs, the Bible tells us.

277
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,020
We find that we come to Acts 1.

278
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,820
It's recorded for us also at the end of the book of Luke,

279
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,180
and the record that's given to us here

280
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,060
is really the ascension of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

281
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,260
When He ascends and goes back to heaven,

282
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,860
and I want you to think about the words

283
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,060
that Jesus speaks to His disciples here.

284
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,340
He tells them in verse number seven, in verse six,

285
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,860
it says, when they therefore were come together,

286
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,100
they asked of Him, saying,

287
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,980
Lord, wilt Thou at this time

288
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,340
restore again the kingdom to Israel?

289
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,180
And He said unto them,

290
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,540
it is not for you to know the times or the seasons

291
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,140
which the Father hath put in His own power,

292
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,240
but ye shall receive power

293
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,220
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

294
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,420
And ye shall be witnesses unto Me,

295
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,420
both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria

296
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,460
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

297
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,820
And then the Bible says this in verse number nine,

298
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,860
and when He had spoken these things,

299
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,500
while they beheld, He was taken up.

300
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Can you imagine?

301
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,260
I mean, Jesus is there having conversation

302
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
with His disciples.

303
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,300
They're speaking and they're asking Him

304
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,460
about the restoration of the kingdom.

305
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,500
Will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

306
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,420
And Jesus speaks to them and says,

307
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,020
listen, it's not for you to know the times or the seasons.

308
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,700
He tells them, here's your duty,

309
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
here's your responsibility.

310
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,740
You shall receive power

311
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,100
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

312
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,620
And you're going to be witnesses.

313
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,780
We're commissioned to go and preach the gospel

314
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,460
to every creature.

315
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,540
And we find that here He listed as being Jerusalem

316
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,900
and Judea and Samaria and the uttermost part of the earth.

317
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,580
And while He's speaking those very words

318
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,420
and while the disciples are listening to Him speak,

319
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,740
the Bible says that they beheld

320
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,100
and it says that He was taken up.

321
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
Can you imagine?

322
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,220
I mean, honestly, can you put yourself there

323
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,860
and see as Jesus had just given

324
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,260
these last words of instruction

325
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,100
and now He's ascending up out of their sight.

326
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,460
He's taken up, the Bible continues and says this,

327
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,460
and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

328
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,540
Wow.

329
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,380
Wow.

330
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,020
He was there speaking to them.

331
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,300
And then He rose, He was ascended up

332
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,500
and then the cloud received Him

333
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,220
and no longer could they see.

334
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,460
And the Bible tells us,

335
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,660
and you and I would probably do the very same thing

336
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,300
in verse number 10.

337
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
The disciples, notice what it says.

338
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,580
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven

339
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,980
as He went up.

340
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,380
You and I'd probably do the same thing, wouldn't we?

341
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,380
I mean, it'd be an awesome sight, right?

342
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,260
I mean, man, He was just talking to us

343
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,060
and now He's ascending up out of our sight

344
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,900
and we stand there gazing up into heaven

345
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,060
and watching this scene that has just transpired

346
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,100
before our very eyes.

347
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,940
And the Bible tells us here in this portion of Scripture

348
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,380
that these angels, these two men stood by them

349
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,380
in white apparel and notice what they say.

350
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,700
Ye men of Galilee,

351
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,620
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

352
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,780
And then notice this confirmation of the promise

353
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,060
that Jesus gave in John 14.

354
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,820
This same Jesus,

355
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,380
which has taken up from you into heaven,

356
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,380
notice, shall so come in like manner

357
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,380
as ye have seen Him go into heaven.

358
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,020
He said in John 14, I will come again.

359
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,740
And now these very disciples that were there

360
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,940
and heard the Word in John 14

361
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,180
are now watching as Jesus has ascended to heaven

362
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,700
and the cloud receives Him out of their sight

363
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,740
and the angels come and speak to them

364
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,540
and the angels said, hey, why are you standing here?

365
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Why are you gazing up into heaven?

366
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,220
Don't you know that the same Jesus,

367
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,940
not another Jesus, the same Jesus in bodily form,

368
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,540
just as He rose from the dead,

369
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,100
just as He ascended to heaven,

370
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,500
this same Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven,

371
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,060
shall so come in like manner.

372
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,420
Do you think for a moment

373
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,860
that perhaps these disciples

374
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,180
had a bell kind of ring off in their head?

375
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,500
You ever hear something

376
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,300
and maybe you kind of had forgotten about that,

377
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,140
whatever that is?

378
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,060
I mean, think about what has transpired

379
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,540
over the last, let's say, what, six weeks,

380
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,420
seven weeks in the lives of the disciples

381
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,340
because He showed Himself alive for 40 days.

382
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,500
And you think about all of these events

383
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
that had transpired from John 14 until Acts 1.

384
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,460
And over these weeks of time,

385
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,500
all of these things that had transpired,

386
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,300
perhaps that promise that had been given in John 14,

387
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,100
now as it's repeated, it's confirmed here in Acts 1,

388
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,620
that light bulb kind of goes off, right?

389
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,220
Man, He's coming again.

390
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,740
This is what He mentioned in John 14.

391
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,460
Remember that when the disciples,

392
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,620
remember, they had forgotten

393
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,940
that He said He was gonna rise again.

394
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,020
If you look at John 2, He says,

395
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,180
if you destroy this temple, I'll rebuild it in three days.

396
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,300
And He spoke of His own resurrection.

397
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,900
They had forgotten that until when?

398
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
Until resurrection morning.

399
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,180
And then all of a sudden they remember,

400
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,380
oh yeah, Jesus told us He was gonna rise again.

401
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
Well, Jesus told them He's gonna come again.

402
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,940
And now as He's ascended out of their sight,

403
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,940
these angels repeat, confirm,

404
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,220
this promise that He's coming again.

405
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,940
Do you think that it gave the disciples

406
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,540
a level of not only confidence,

407
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,940
but a measure of expectation?

408
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,100
I mean, if you read the book of Acts,

409
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,660
I believe that you're reading as the Holy Spirit of God,

410
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,140
as God worked through His people,

411
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,900
you're reading about a people

412
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,900
that were expecting the return of the Lord.

413
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,540
They were living in expectancy.

414
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,620
They were living that Jesus could,

415
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,220
we don't know when He's coming back.

416
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,460
He didn't give us the date or the time.

417
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,180
And so He just said He's coming again.

418
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,300
And so therefore, I'm living in that state of expectancy.

419
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm expecting that He could return at any time.

420
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,460
And if we're expecting that He could return at any time,

421
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,820
the question that must be answered is, are you ready?

422
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,460
Are you ready for His return?

423
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,100
Are you ready?

424
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,980
Look over at 2 Peter, if you will.

425
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,500
It's a verse of scripture that we're familiar with,

426
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,460
but I wanna focus on this verse

427
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,660
just for a moment here this morning.

428
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,300
And I want you to just allow it to sink in.

429
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,700
Remember here in 2 Peter 3,

430
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,980
actually begin reading in verse number one.

431
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,140
We'll take a little time here

432
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,820
and look through these first several verses

433
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,220
in 2 Peter 3, but notice the Bible says this,

434
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,780
"'This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you,

435
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,380
"'in both which I stir up your pure minds

436
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,080
"'by way of remembrance.'"

437
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,820
Listen, it's good for us to be reminded of some things.

438
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,660
Amen?

439
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,880
Peter's basically saying this to the disciple

440
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,520
or to those that he's writing to.

441
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,640
He's saying, listen, I'm not writing anything new to you.

442
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,380
I'm reminding you of some things.

443
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,160
I'm reminding you.

444
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,440
In fact, he mentions that even as he writes

445
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,580
the book of 1 Peter, that he was stirring up their minds

446
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,400
and he was trying to help them remember some things.

447
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,420
And we find here, it says this in verse number two,

448
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,040
"'That ye may be mindful of the words

449
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,700
"'which were spoken before by the holy prophets

450
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,980
"'and of the commandment of us, the apostles,

451
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,040
"'of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first,

452
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,180
"'that there shall come in the last days scoffers

453
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,340
"'walking after their own lust.'"

454
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,300
And notice what they're going to say

455
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,020
according to verse number four,

456
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,300
where is the promise of His coming?

457
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,460
Isn't it interesting to you that the scoffers

458
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,700
are aware of the promise that God has made?

459
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,020
The scoffers are aware of it,

460
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,220
but because of the length of time

461
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,300
between the promise given and the promise fulfilled,

462
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,780
there will be scoffers, mockers, that will say,

463
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,540
where is the promise of His coming?

464
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,700
For since the fathers fell asleep,

465
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,340
all things continue as they were

466
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,820
from the beginning of the creation.

467
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,740
And then notice this statement in verse number five.

468
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,300
The Bible says, for this,

469
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,980
they willingly are ignorant of.

470
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,620
You know, it's sad that we've come into contact

471
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,900
with individuals that are willingly ignorant.

472
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,180
They just don't want to know the truth.

473
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,260
It's not that the truth isn't available.

474
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,540
It's not even perhaps that you haven't tried

475
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,780
to present the truth,

476
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,260
but they just don't want the truth.

477
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,620
Of this, they are willingly ignorant.

478
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,220
It's not that the Scriptures don't declare

479
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,020
what Peter is getting ready to say.

480
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,380
Remember, he says I'm going to remind you

481
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,420
of some things.

482
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,020
This is not something new.

483
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,500
Notice what he says in verse 5,

484
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
that by the word of God,

485
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,260
the heavens were of old

486
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,820
and the earth standing out of the water

487
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,260
and in the water,

488
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,260
whereby the world that then was

489
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,780
being overflowed with water perished.

490
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,140
What's he speaking of?

491
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,380
The flood.

492
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,820
He's speaking of the flood.

493
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,180
You go back to Genesis 6-8

494
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,180
and you read about the flood

495
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,420
that God of course is judging.

496
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,260
Why?

497
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,180
Because of the wickedness,

498
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,540
the sinfulness,

499
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,460
their thoughts and imaginations

500
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,980
are evil continually

501
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,420
and God as a righteous, holy, just God

502
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,060
says they're going to be judged.

503
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,820
Now because He's gracious and merciful,

504
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,660
He has Noah, a preacher of righteousness,

505
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,500
preach for 120 years.

506
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,740
There was safety in one place.

507
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,460
That was in the ark.

508
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,060
It's interesting to note that the ark

509
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,900
had but one door.

510
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,900
There's only one way to enter into the ark.

511
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,540
There was only safety in one place

512
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,420
and that's in the ark.

513
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,500
And when the floods came,

514
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,460
when the rains came,

515
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,780
when the deep was opened up,

516
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,300
no doubt in my mind,

517
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,020
there were individuals

518
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,820
that had wished they had listened

519
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
and they had gotten in the ark.

520
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,260
The Bible doesn't tell us this,

521
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,220
but I do not believe that it's a far stretch

522
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,500
to have the idea that perhaps

523
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,580
when those rains came,

524
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,060
that there were people that sought

525
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,660
to get into the ark.

526
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,820
But you know what the Bible tells us?

527
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,500
That God shut the door.

528
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,620
God shut the door.

529
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,700
You know, those people didn't know

530
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,820
when the rain was going to come.

531
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,020
They didn't even know what rain was.

532
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,180
Right?

533
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,900
You study it, you understand it.

534
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Noah says it's going to rain.

535
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,020
You're crazy, Noah.

536
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,460
They don't even know what rain is.

537
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,700
But the rain came.

538
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,620
And Peter says here,

539
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,300
they're willingly ignorant of this.

540
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,660
Listen, judgment came, the flood.

541
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,340
Jesus is coming.

542
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,100
They said, where is the promise of his coming?

543
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,940
Notice verse seven,

544
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,860
but the heavens and the earth,

545
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,740
which are now by the same word

546
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
are kept in store,

547
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,900
reserved under fire against the day of judgment

548
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,380
and perdition of ungodly men.

549
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,380
There will be a judgment again.

550
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,140
And we see that detailed in more

551
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,220
in verse number 11.

552
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,180
But I want you to notice in verse number eight,

553
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,580
the Bible says, but beloved,

554
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,460
be not ignorant of this one thing,

555
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,780
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years.

556
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,220
And a thousand years as one day.

557
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,060
Now, why is that the case?

558
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,780
It's because our God transcends time.

559
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,180
He's outside of time.

560
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,220
Now, we are controlled by time, are we not?

561
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,300
We have appointments and we have calendars

562
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,820
and we have clocks and we have watches,

563
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,300
and we're controlled by time,

564
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,580
some of us more than others,

565
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,660
but we understand the way that time operates

566
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,260
in our society.

567
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,020
And the reality is that God is outside of time.

568
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,660
He says, listen,

569
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,780
I don't want you to be ignorant of this one thing.

570
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,300
I want you to be informed.

571
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,620
I want you to understand this

572
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,860
because they're saying,

573
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,780
where is the promise of his coming?

574
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,780
And though it's been over nearly now 2000 years

575
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,060
since Jesus ascended into heaven,

576
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,460
it does not mean that there's any less

577
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,740
of the promise, any less confidence,

578
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,620
any less expectation that we have.

579
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,900
In fact, our expectation increases even more

580
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,940
with each passing day

581
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,700
because we're a day closer, amen?

582
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,340
And here we find that he says,

583
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,940
I don't want you to be ignorant of this thing.

584
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,860
I want you to understand that our God is outside of time,

585
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,020
that one day is as a thousand years

586
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,860
and a thousand years as a day.

587
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,180
And so for us this morning in 2021,

588
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,580
it's been nearly 2000 years

589
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,660
since Jesus Christ went to that old rugged cross

590
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,900
and he bled and died and he was buried and he rose again.

591
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,340
And then after he'd made himself known and appeared,

592
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,820
he ascended to heaven giving that promise.

593
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,660
And here we are nearly 2000 years later,

594
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,020
but on God's timetable,

595
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,100
according to what we see here,

596
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,700
it's just a couple of days, right?

597
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,620
Because God is outside of time.

598
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,060
I want you to understand the significance

599
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,260
of verse number nine.

600
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,980
The Bible says this,

601
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,980
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise

602
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,020
as some men count slackness.

603
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,620
Aren't you thankful that our God

604
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,020
is not slack concerning his promise?

605
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,500
Listen, there will be scoffers,

606
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,180
there will be individuals that say,

607
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,500
hey, where is the promise of his coming?

608
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,260
I mean, you guys are preaching about

609
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,660
and you're singing about

610
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,900
and you're living with this expectation

611
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,660
that there'll be scoffers and mockers

612
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,860
that say, where is the promise of his coming?

613
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,820
And we just reassure and comfort ourselves

614
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,580
and have that confidence that our God,

615
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,860
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise

616
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,140
as some men count slackness.

617
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,980
No doubt in your life and in my life,

618
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,700
there have been times that we've made a promise,

619
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,100
a commitment to someone that we just flat out

620
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
were not able to fulfill.

621
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,980
It's not the case with God.

622
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,100
It's not the case.

623
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,260
Notice the conclusion of verse number nine,

624
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,140
but is long suffering to us word.

625
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,420
Aren't you thankful that he's long suffering?

626
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,380
And then it says this,

627
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,780
not willing that any should perish,

628
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,900
but that all should come to repentance.

629
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,100
There's some lost people that need to be saved.

630
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,780
I want you to just for a moment, think about this.

631
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,140
Think about the day that you got saved.

632
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,900
How many of you know the day that you got saved?

633
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,420
You remember, I mean, maybe not the exact day,

634
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,820
but you remember the time period in which you got saved.

635
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,420
I remember I got saved on August 31st, 1997.

636
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,940
I was 17 years old when I got saved,

637
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,860
senior in high school.

638
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,260
Each of you, you have a day

639
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,700
in which you trust that Christ is your savior.

640
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,140
Let me ask you this question.

641
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,420
When you think about that day

642
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
that Jesus saved your soul,

643
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,020
aren't you thankful he didn't come the day before?

644
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,940
You ever think about that?

645
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,580
What if he came back on August 15th, 1997

646
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,180
as before I got saved?

647
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,380
I'd heard the gospel, but I'd rejected the gospel.

648
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,700
I'd heard it for a couple of years at that point,

649
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,820
but I never accepted it.

650
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,980
I never trusted Christ as my savior.

651
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,500
And we can go around the room and say,

652
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,260
when did you get saved, when did you get saved,

653
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,100
and you know that date, that time frame, the year maybe.

654
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Say, man, aren't you thankful

655
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
that God didn't come back before then?

656
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,300
See, because he's not slack concerning his promise

657
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,340
that some men cannot slackness,

658
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,900
but he's long-suffering to us-ward,

659
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,620
not willing that any should perish,

660
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,580
but that all should come to repentance.

661
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,380
There's going to come a day that he's going to return.

662
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,420
I don't know what day that is,

663
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,260
but I'll say this, for those that have heard the gospel,

664
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,020
they've heard that Jesus loved them,

665
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,620
that they're a sinner,

666
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,940
and they heard that Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God,

667
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,620
went to the cross of Calvary,

668
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,260
he shed his blood, he was crucified on that cruel cross,

669
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,780
and he was buried in a borrowed tomb,

670
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,740
and he rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

671
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,700
He wants you to be saved.

672
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Paul said this, today is the day of salvation, amen?

673
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,260
And you think about the significance of this promise

674
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,060
that he's long-suffering to us-ward.

675
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,540
I'm not sure when that last person

676
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,860
before the tribulation hour

677
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,220
is going to place their faith and trust in Christ.

678
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,260
I'm not sure when that's going to happen,

679
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,820
but I can be confident and I can have great joy

680
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,980
in knowing that our God is not willing

681
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,260
that any should perish,

682
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,820
but that all should come to repentance.

683
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,300
For God so loved the world

684
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,700
that he gave his only begotten Son,

685
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,100
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

686
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,660
but have everlasting life.

687
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,100
Why is it that we work on putting Bibles together

688
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,380
during our scripture assembly?

689
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,220
Why is it that we send money

690
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,980
to have Bibles printed in Samoa?

691
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,619
Because we want them to hear the wonderful message

692
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,619
that God so loved the world.

693
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:05,380
We want them to understand those that are in darkness,

694
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,340
those in whom the God of this world

695
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,820
hath blinded their minds,

696
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,740
lest the light of the glorious Gospel

697
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,900
should shine in unto them.

698
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,380
We want them to know Jesus saves.

699
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,780
Amen?

700
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,619
Why?

701
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:19,020
Because there's a real hell.

702
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,140
There's a lake of fire.

703
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,180
And the Bible tells us in Revelation 20

704
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,100
that the books are open.

705
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,940
And whosoever is not found written in the book of life

706
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,559
was cast into the lake of fire.

707
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,960
This is the second death.

708
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,800
Oh man, that's sobering.

709
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
Is it not?

710
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,640
Speaking of the simplicity of the promise,

711
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,119
getting back to the truth

712
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,040
that our God is not slack concerning His promise,

713
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,680
it brings confidence, it brings expectation.

714
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,119
I spent much time dealing with the simplicity

715
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,720
of the promise, but I want you to understand

716
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,320
the significance of the promise.

717
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,660
and the significance of the promise.

718
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,500
Why is it that we call it the blessed hope?

719
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,840
Why is it that we sing and rejoice?

720
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,000
Why is it that when we sing,

721
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,640
coming again,

722
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,840
and Dean is up here leading

723
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,180
and getting excited,

724
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,580
why is it that when Holly and Joseph

725
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,940
sang that song this morning,

726
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,980
when they practiced, I said,

727
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,100
hey, listen, don't get bothered if I join you.

728
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
I know the song.

729
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,700
It doesn't mean I'm going to sing it on tune,

730
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,820
but I know the song.

731
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,020
And I said, don't get nervous

732
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,320
if I start singing behind you.

733
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,860
Why does it cause us to be excited?

734
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,060
Why does it bring joy?

735
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,640
Because there's some significance

736
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,820
about this promise.

737
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,280
Turn to 1 Thessalonians 4 if you will.

738
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,780
I want you to first think about

739
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,020
the significance for us

740
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,900
as the people of God.

741
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,400
In 1 Thessalonians 4,

742
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,280
in fact, much of that special

743
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,400
that Holly and Joseph sang this morning,

744
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,440
you could look at 1 Thessalonians 4

745
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,400
verses 13-18 and you could see

746
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,920
how this particular portion of Scripture

747
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,040
had great influence upon the songwriter

748
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,080
who wrote that song.

749
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,000
And we notice in this portion of Scripture,

750
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,380
the Bible says this in verse number 13,

751
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,800
but I would not have you

752
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,080
to be ignorant, brethren.

753
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,200
We saw that in the book

754
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,080
of 2 Peter 3.

755
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,240
Listen, God doesn't want people to be ignorant.

756
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,580
He wants us to be informed.

757
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,960
He's given us a precious book

758
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,740
so that we could know.

759
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,000
He says, I would not that you be ignorant, brethren,

760
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,680
concerning them which are asleep.

761
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,580
Notice what he says,

762
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,500
that you sorrow not even as others

763
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,360
which have no hope.

764
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,900
You know that we're living in the midst

765
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,940
of a people that are hopeless.

766
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,820
They have no hope.

767
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,380
The fear of death has gripped,

768
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,080
literally gripped the lives of billions.

769
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,180
We see it all around us today.

770
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,100
Do we not?

771
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,220
In these last 18 months,

772
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,180
people that never gave really two thoughts

773
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,300
about dying have been absolutely controlled

774
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,620
by the fear of dying.

775
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,780
Why? Because they're hopeless.

776
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,340
They don't know what's going to happen

777
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,220
when they die.

778
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,940
I don't fear death.

779
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,900
According to Hebrews chapter 2,

780
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,580
one of the things that the Lord accomplished

781
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,580
on the cross of Calvary

782
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,380
is He delivered those that had the fear of death

783
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,020
from the fear of death.

784
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,540
Amen?

785
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
And notice He says this,

786
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm thankful that we have hope.

787
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,300
Notice when He says,

788
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,220
but if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

789
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,740
we believe that.

790
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,700
Even so, them also which sleep are dead,

791
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,900
that's the word, it's what it means,

792
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,660
in Jesus will God bring with Him.

793
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Remember when Jesus tells the disciples

794
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,180
in John 11 that Lazarus was asleep.

795
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,900
And they said, man, if he's asleep,

796
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,460
let him sleep because he'd been sick.

797
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,220
And Jesus had to speak plainly to them

798
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,940
and said, Lazarus is dead.

799
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,140
That's a common vernacular that they would use.

800
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,380
And here He's speaking of those that died in Christ.

801
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,980
It says this in v. 15,

802
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,460
for this we say unto you,

803
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
notice what He says,

804
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,380
by the word of the Lord.

805
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,980
It's important for us to understand

806
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,540
that significant statement.

807
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,380
This is not just Paul's opinion.

808
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,300
We're not just sitting around a round table

809
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,700
saying, okay, what's your thought?

810
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,860
What's your opinion on this?

811
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
And how about you?

812
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,100
What's your opinion on this?

813
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,820
No, no, no, we're not looking for opinions.

814
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,620
We're looking for what thus saith the Lord.

815
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,460
Amen?

816
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,300
You can find many opinions around our world today.

817
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,340
You can find opinions,

818
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,580
you go and have surveys,

819
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,140
and you can ask people what they need to do

820
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,980
to go to heaven.

821
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
You can ask people all sorts of questions

822
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,900
about religion and so on and so forth.

823
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,500
And there's a plurality of ideas that exist.

824
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,300
The devil is not short on deception.

825
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,140
But what does God say?

826
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,100
Paul says, I am telling you this,

827
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
this we say unto you,

828
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,220
by the word of the Lord.

829
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,500
He actually says that we,

830
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,620
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord,

831
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,700
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

832
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,540
You notice that in verse number 15,

833
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,700
it's a level of confidence and certainty

834
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,500
that are alive and remain unto the coming Lord.

835
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,020
He's going to come.

836
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,380
And there's going to be a group,

837
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,860
a generation of believers that are alive and remain

838
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,100
at the coming of the Lord.

839
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
Wouldn't it be great if we're that generation?

840
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,339
Amen?

841
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,860
It'd be wonderful.

842
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,020
And he says that we shall not prevent

843
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,740
or go before those that have died in Christ.

844
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,100
Notice in verse 16,

845
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,580
for the Lord himself,

846
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,220
isn't that what the angel said in Acts 1?

847
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,700
This same Jesus,

848
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
which you've seen go into heaven,

849
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,580
shall so come in like manner.

850
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,420
He says this,

851
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,580
for the Lord himself,

852
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,339
it's a personal return,

853
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:42,260
shall descend from heaven with a shout.

854
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,700
The voice of the archangel with the trump of God.

855
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,580
He says this,

856
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,660
the dead in Christ shall rise first.

857
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,940
I'm thankful that Jesus himself is coming to receive us.

858
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,660
He could send an angel,

859
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,740
but he's coming himself.

860
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,580
Isn't that wonderful?

861
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,420
It's sweet.

862
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
It's precious.

863
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,020
We see those that have died in Christ,

864
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,940
the reality is that we may not be the generation

865
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,779
that are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.

866
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:10,619
Why?

867
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,580
Because the reality is just as David said,

868
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,500
remember when David was being hunted by Saul,

869
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,339
and he says this,

870
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,460
there's but a step between me and death.

871
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,540
You know the reality is that for you and for me,

872
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,580
there's but a step between us and death.

873
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,420
Boast not thyself of tomorrow, Solomon says,

874
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,179
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

875
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,660
We have plans for tomorrow,

876
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,899
but we don't know if we're gonna live tomorrow.

877
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:32,779
What is your life?

878
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,660
It's but a vapor that appears for a little time

879
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,740
and then vanisheth away.

880
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,820
That's what we find in the book of James

881
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,420
in the fourth chapter.

882
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,899
And so we find here that as the truth is,

883
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,420
we may die in Christ,

884
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,140
we may die before the coming of the Lord.

885
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,540
And if we do, we have this promise

886
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,500
that we're going to be raised first.

887
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,779
Because those that are alive and remain

888
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,860
shall not prevent them,

889
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,059
shall not go before them that are dead in Christ.

890
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,619
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

891
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,940
Notice verse 17, then.

892
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,300
And this is speaking to the generation that's still alive.

893
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,820
And I hope it's my generation, I really do.

894
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,220
Then we which are alive and remain

895
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,779
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

896
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:18,460
to meet the Lord in the air.

897
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,339
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

898
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,179
Isn't that wonderful?

899
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:27,940
He finishes the passage by saying this,

900
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,100
wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

901
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,660
Now think about the significance of that

902
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,580
where we started in John chapter number 14.

903
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,179
Let not your heart be troubled, right?

904
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,899
And so God, the Lord Jesus Christ,

905
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,380
He gave a word to those disciples

906
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,580
that had troubled hearts

907
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,500
that would cause them to have some confidence,

908
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,460
but also cause them to have some comfort

909
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,380
for their troubled hearts.

910
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,260
And here we find that Paul says,

911
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,740
wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

912
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,380
And we find here this morning,

913
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,940
that in fact, we could be that generation

914
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,140
that are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord.

915
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
And the Bible tells us

916
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,580
that we will be caught up together with them.

917
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,940
There's gonna be this great,

918
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,300
I mean, it's amazing what's going to happen.

919
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:12,660
The dead in Christ are gonna rise first.

920
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,339
By the way, this all happens in a moment

921
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,380
in the twinkling of an eye,

922
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
according to 1 Corinthians 15.

923
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,940
I mean, just bam, that fast.

924
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,619
According to 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

925
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,860
right here, the next passage,

926
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,779
it says that he's gonna come like a thief in the night.

927
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,460
Okay, so it's just bam, it just takes place.

928
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,740
But the dead in Christ are gonna rise first.

929
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,460
Then we which are alive and remain

930
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,779
are gonna be caught up together.

931
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:40,059
And the Bible says together with them in the clouds

932
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:42,260
to meet the Lord in the air.

933
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,580
Then it says this,

934
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,220
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

935
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,700
Man, that's wonderful.

936
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
That gives us a level of confidence.

937
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,260
I mean, listen, this is a significant promise.

938
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,140
It's a simple promise.

939
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,179
But when you begin to study the whole of Scripture,

940
00:37:58,179 --> 00:37:59,660
you begin to dig into the Word of God,

941
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,820
you say, listen, this promise is significant to me.

942
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,380
This promise brings me joy and comfort

943
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,540
and confidence and expectation.

944
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,260
This promise is going to influence and impact

945
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
the way that I live my life.

946
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,100
Why?

947
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,300
Because He might come today.

948
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
What a joy.

949
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,300
We get to meet the Lord in the air.

950
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,660
He said, I go to prepare a place for you.

951
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,660
He says, if I go, I will come again

952
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,539
and receive you unto Myself,

953
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:37,179
that where I am, there ye may be also.

954
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,539
We have great confidence as the people of God.

955
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,020
Gives us great joy.

956
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,859
Listen, we've mentioned in the book of Hebrews

957
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:46,700
in the 11th chapter

958
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,619
that we're just pilgrims and strangers.

959
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,539
We sing the song, this world is not my home,

960
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,299
I'm just a passing through.

961
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:53,140
Amen?

962
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,100
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.

963
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,940
Amen?

964
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm going home one day.

965
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,059
Listen, my citizenship is in heaven.

966
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,100
I'm an American citizen

967
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,660
and I'm thankful for the opportunity to be in this country

968
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,340
and to be a citizen of this country.

969
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,539
But most importantly is that I'm a citizen of heaven.

970
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,780
I'm a child of God.

971
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:15,820
And as a child of God, I have this great promise.

972
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,059
Listen, you understand that this promise,

973
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,539
the significance of this promise

974
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,619
as we're looking here in this portion of Scripture

975
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,940
is that it's significant to me as a believer.

976
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,299
But I want you to think about it for the unbeliever.

977
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,660
I want you to think about it for the truth that listen,

978
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,580
God is not slack concerning His promise.

979
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,059
He's not willing that any should perish,

980
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,580
but that all should come to repentance.

981
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,299
But we understand and we know this morning

982
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:42,100
that not all people are saved.

983
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,700
There are two groups of people in the world.

984
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,859
There are people that have been saved

985
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,500
that have been born again,

986
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,260
and there are people that are lost.

987
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:53,460
And by the way, all of the people that are saved

988
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,100
and born again were lost at one point.

989
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,940
Amen?

990
00:39:58,179 --> 00:39:59,859
We were lost.

991
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,299
We were dead in our sins and our transgressions.

992
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:08,459
trespasses. We too had no hope. But God, you read Ephesians 2, it'll cause you to rejoice

993
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:17,019
greatly in your salvation. But God, we understand there will be people that have rejected this

994
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:23,579
message and they will enter into the tribulation. Specifically, I'm speaking of those that have,

995
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:29,419
I believe, received, they've heard the message, but they've rejected the message. And the

996
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:33,019
Bible tells us, I don't have time to read all of it, but in 2 Thessalonians chapter

997
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:39,339
number 2, really verses 3-12, if I had the time I'd read the entirety of the portion

998
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:45,179
of Scripture that is before us. But he's speaking about the return of the Lord and the midpoint

999
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,459
of the tribulation is in full view in verse number 3. And he speaks about the fact that

1000
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:53,099
the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Listen, we see that, it's in verse number

1001
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:59,319
7, we see that in our society today. The mystery of iniquity doth already work. Some people

1002
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,599
are looking at what's taking place in our world today, in our country today, and they're

1003
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,559
saying, things are falling apart! No, no, things are falling in place. You know why

1004
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,879
things aren't falling apart? Because we serve the Lord God omnipotent. And he's in charge.

1005
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:17,999
The heathen rage, right? I mean, they set up their plans on how they're going to the

1006
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,479
kings of the earth, how they're going to overthrow, and God shall have them in derision. He laughs

1007
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:29,519
at them. Psalm 2, right? You just go over there and read it. Our God reigns and He rules.

1008
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,799
There's no way that things are falling apart. It's that they're falling in place and God's

1009
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:39,999
plan and God's purpose will be fulfilled. We find that it says this in verse number

1010
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:46,439
10 of 2 Thessalonians 2, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because

1011
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:51,599
they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Speaking of those that

1012
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,479
had heard and rejected, it says in verse number 11, and for this cause God shall send

1013
00:41:55,479 --> 00:42:00,079
them strong delusion that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believe

1014
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,639
not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. Those are sad verses of Scripture, to be honest

1015
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:12,639
with you. There are some people that think that they can play a game with God. They feel

1016
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:19,799
like that they can play with eternity. You know, I'm not really interested in trusting

1017
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:23,999
Christ as my Savior now, but if all these things really come to pass that you say are

1018
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:30,479
going to come to pass then, I'll go ahead and trust Christ then. It's not going to happen.

1019
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:34,999
On the authority of the Word of God, it's not going to happen because God is going to

1020
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:41,199
send strong delusion and they're going to believe a lie. I don't know how it all works,

1021
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,319
but somehow they're going to believe that lie, the lie of the Antichrist, the lie of

1022
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:50,759
the enemy. And so that's why it's so imperative that we understand that today is the day

1023
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:55,759
of salvation. That's why it's so imperative when we think about this promise of His return.

1024
00:42:55,759 --> 00:43:01,999
Listen, the promise of His return is so significant for me. This simple promise is so significant

1025
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:07,159
for me as a child of God and I rejoice greatly, but you know at the same time it causes my

1026
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:14,159
heart to be burdened for lost people. It causes my heart to be burdened for lost people.

1027
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,959
One of the nights of the revival meeting, the conclusion of the message from Brother

1028
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:26,839
Edwards was that God would put a name on your heart, on my heart, and perhaps there's someone

1029
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:31,479
that God has placed on your heart even then or maybe as you've continued to pray about

1030
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:37,079
it, but the reality is this, we know lost people. There's someone that you work with.

1031
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,839
There's maybe a relative. There's somebody that you know that's not saved. We don't look

1032
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:48,879
down upon them. We don't judge them. No, no, rather we pray for them and we desire to share

1033
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:56,319
with them the truth that they might be saved because we don't want them to come to the

1034
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:03,319
place of the rapture and when we're taken out of here and we're forever with the Lord

1035
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:09,559
that they are damned to believe a lie. And if you read about the tribulation, we understand

1036
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,839
the significance. I won't have time this morning to get into it of how that really

1037
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:17,119
is dealing with Israel again as a nation and all that's taken place with Jacob's trouble

1038
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,839
and so on and so forth, but the reality is that you read about the tribulation in the

1039
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,279
book of Revelation, it is an awful period of time. You read about the judgments that

1040
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:29,639
are being poured out. You read about the death. Listen, they think we have a lot of death

1041
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:36,199
now with this pandemic. It is nothing in comparison to what's going to happen during the tribulation.

1042
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:43,199
They are going to collectively lose their minds. Honestly. You're going to go insane.

1043
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:51,199
Destruction. We don't glory in that. Knowing the terror of the Lord, what is it, 2 Corinthians

1044
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,119
chapter number 5? Turn over there if you will and I want you to think about what Paul says

1045
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:01,639
here in this portion of scripture because the reality this morning is that when we think

1046
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:06,319
about the significance of this promise that Jesus said, I will come again and those of

1047
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,839
us that have been born again, we rejoice greatly, but at the same time, we ought to be mindful

1048
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:14,599
of those that have not yet been saved. It ought to motivate us. It ought to cause us

1049
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:20,359
to have a passion for souls. The Bible, excuse me, the hymn writer said, give me a passion

1050
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,720
for souls, dear Lord, a passion to save the lost. Why? Because I understand their destination.

1051
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:32,039
I understand, listen, I'm thankful that my eternal destination is secure. I am kept

1052
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:38,679
by the power of God and if you've been saved, so are you. But what about the lost man? Verse

1053
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:44,659
10 of 2 Corinthians 5, for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone

1054
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:49,039
may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or

1055
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:58,839
bad. Notice this, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are made

1056
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,639
manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. We don't have

1057
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:07,519
time again to read through all of this, but notice what he says in verse number 14. We

1058
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:10,639
hear a great message from Brother Savalle on this verse of scripture, for the love of

1059
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,279
Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

1060
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:19,799
Notice verse 15, and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth

1061
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:23,839
live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. Notice verse number

1062
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,919
20, now then we are ambassadors for Christ. Who is the we? It's those that have been born

1063
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:35,639
again. We see that in verse number 17, therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

1064
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,500
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new. And so those saved people

1065
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:45,039
that are being written to, we are the ambassadors of Christ. And we notice the significance

1066
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:52,759
of verse number 21, for he hath made him, Jesus Christ, to be sin for us, who knew

1067
00:46:52,759 --> 00:47:00,519
no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. How many of you know the song

1068
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,159
The Old Account Was Settled? It's a good one. I don't think it's in our hymnal, but man,

1069
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,759
The Old Account Was Settled long ago. And if you get a good bass that sings that song,

1070
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:13,919
man, they can get into that long ago, I settled it all, and so on and so forth. Man, it's

1071
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:19,759
a great song. The Old Account Was Settled long ago. You know the significance of that

1072
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:26,079
transaction, what took place? On the day that you got saved, on the day that I got saved,

1073
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,839
if there's somebody under the sound of my voice today, whether they're here locally

1074
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:39,119
or they're watching via live stream, that transaction could take place today. I have

1075
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,759
nothing to offer. All of my good works are as filthy rags, according to Isaiah. For by

1076
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:49,199
grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It's the gift of God, not

1077
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:56,440
of works, lest any man should boast. I understand that I have nothing to offer. I'm just a sinner

1078
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:05,000
in need of the Savior. I'm just a sinner, and my sin condemns me. The Bible tells us

1079
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:13,239
that he that believeth not is condemned already in John chapter number 3. Condemned. For the

1080
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:25,959
wages of sin is death. But there's a God in heaven who loves His creation. And all the

1081
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:34,199
way back in the garden, the picture that was first given of the sacrifice of an animal

1082
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:40,519
for blood to be shed so that Adam and Eve could be properly covered, thus giving us

1083
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:45,719
for all of that Old Testament history, the picture after picture, the Passover would

1084
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:51,719
come on the scene in the book of Exodus, and all that would take place, the significance

1085
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,979
that Christ, our Passover, would come. And He would die in our place. When we have nothing

1086
00:48:57,979 --> 00:49:04,700
to offer, God commendeth His love toward us in that while we're yet sinners, Christ

1087
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:11,859
died for us. I don't deserve it. That's why it's called mercy. That's why it's called

1088
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:19,539
grace. If we deserved it, it wouldn't be grace or mercy, right? It'd be what we deserve.

1089
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:27,779
But honestly, what we deserve is hell. Because we're guilty. We're guilty. But God who is

1090
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:35,779
rich in mercy. Ephesians 2, I think it's verse 4, maybe verse 5. God who is rich in

1091
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:46,260
mercy. What a joy. And I have nothing to offer, but because of His death, burial, and glorious

1092
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:55,659
resurrection, He who knew no sin, He was made sin for us. The innocent died for the guilty.

1093
00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:02,299
The payment was made. And it was accepted. And Jesus offers

1094
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:12,979
us His righteousness, because all of my righteousness is filthy rags, not acceptable. But God says,

1095
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:20,819
I love you so much, I died for you, and now I offer you my righteousness, that we, that

1096
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:27,259
we are now able to have the righteousness of God. We call it the imputed righteousness

1097
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:31,379
as placed upon our account. When God looks at me, when He looks at you, if you've been

1098
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:37,699
saved this morning, He sees the righteousness of His Son, that we're washed in the blood.

1099
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:44,099
We sing the song, Are You Washed? in the blood, the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb. Isaiah

1100
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:49,739
says, Hey, come, let us reason together, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white

1101
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:55,559
as snow. Listen, this morning I'm thankful for the wonderful promise, I will come again.

1102
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,399
I will come again. It's a simple promise, it's a significant promise, and we can rejoice

1103
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:06,079
greatly and we can know this morning, listen, I don't know all that's going to happen between

1104
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,299
now and then, but I know that one day I'm going to go be with my Lord. There's a whole

1105
00:51:11,299 --> 00:51:16,559
lot of people that we meet along the way that have not yet placed their faith and trust

1106
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:23,839
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. Oh, that God would motivate us to be bold

1107
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:29,119
in preaching the gospel, that we would be His ambassadors, as it says in verse number

1108
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,239
20 of this passage of Scripture, that we would understand the terror of the Lord and therefore

1109
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:42,919
persuade men. God would work in the heart and life of the one that may be under the

1110
00:51:42,919 --> 00:51:47,679
sound of my voice that does not know Christ as their Savior. If they were to die today,

1111
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:53,679
they have no idea where they'd go. Oh, that today would be the day of their salvation.

1112
00:51:53,679 --> 00:52:00,079
The Holy Spirit of God takes the Word of God and works, convinces of sin, of Christ's righteousness

1113
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:06,239
and of judgment to come. So I place my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible

1114
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,159
says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Listen, Jesus

1115
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:17,439
is coming again. But He said, listen, I'm coming again, but you have a job, you have

1116
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:23,079
a responsibility. Work, amen, for the night is coming, the songwriter said, when no man

1117
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,199
shall work. So we have an opportunity. You know something that's interesting? When I

1118
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,439
go to heaven, when you go to heaven, whether that's through the rapture or through death,

1119
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:37,759
I will never have another opportunity to share the gospel with someone. Only now do I have

1120
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,719
that opportunity. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank

1121
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:52,719
you for the Word of God. Thank you for the truth of your return. I will come again. I

1122
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:58,199
thank you for that promise. It's a simple promise, but oh, how impactful, how significant

1123
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:06,199
this promise is. Perhaps this morning, there's one that does not have that same level of

1124
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:15,599
joy and excitement about this promise because they've never trusted Christ as their Savior.

1125
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,679
Oh God, I pray that you'd work in their heart and life. Help them to understand their need

1126
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:31,319
for the Savior. I pray that before it's eternally too late, that they'd get saved. I pray for

1127
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:38,959
those of us that have been born again, Lord, I pray that you'd help us this morning to

1128
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:46,839
live with that expectation. As we observe the Lord's Supper, we're mindful of 1 Corinthians

1129
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:53,039
11, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Help us to live that life of expectancy every

1130
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:59,119
day, to be mindful that today could be the day. And Lord, I pray that you'd help us to

1131
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:07,359
live in such a way that we would, knowing the terror of the Lord, persuade men, that

1132
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,679
we would be your ambassadors, your representatives, that we would be faithful proclaimers of the

1133
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:20,599
gospel, conveyors of the love of Christ. Use us, God, for your honor and glory. I pray

1134
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,479
that you'd work in the time of invitation. You know the need of each one that's here.

1135
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:31,919
I pray that you'd graciously work and move, and God, you'd be glorified. For it's in Christ's

1136
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:35,759
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. No one's looking

1137
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:39,879
around. Kimberly will play quietly on the piano. It's our custom at the end of our services

1138
00:54:39,879 --> 00:54:46,119
to have an invitation where we invite you to respond. The Lord, I've spoken to your

1139
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,000
heart this morning. Maybe you're not sure of heaven. We'd love to take a Bible and show

1140
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,239
you I can know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe this morning you just want to

1141
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,879
come and thank God for the wonderful promise that He's coming again. Maybe you want to

1142
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:05,679
ask Him to help you to be found faithful, to live with that expectancy of His soon return.

1143
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:07,599
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
