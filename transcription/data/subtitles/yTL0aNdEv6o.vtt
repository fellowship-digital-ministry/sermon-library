WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
I'm gonna preach our behavior in the workplace,

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.199
Colossians 3.

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:06.599
I'll preach it next week or the following, we'll see.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.159
We have a baby dedication next week,

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.880
so we'll probably be preaching something different next week.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.039
But I'm so thankful, as I was praying this morning

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.300
and even thinking about that song

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.940
as I heard them practicing.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.200
Our Savior is coming again, amen.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.040
We live in the midst of chaos and confusion and turmoil

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.139
and people are living in fear

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:27.600
and all sorts of things are going on.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.280
But man, we are singing this morning

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.920
those songs that we sang about Jesus coming,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680
my cup's over run, right?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.080
Oh, say, but I'm glad, why?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.000
Because my sins are forgiven.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.220
But you know, the reality is that the story

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.099
of the Lord Jesus Christ, the truth of God's word,

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:44.720
as I mentioned, William Scroggie saying

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.560
that the Bible is the unfolding drama of redemption.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.919
You look in the Old Testament

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:52.240
and you find how the Lord, through the Old Testament,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.080
is giving us types and pictures and prophecies

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.919
with regard to the coming of Messiah.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.040
But you understand that the prophecies

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.080
that are contained within the Old Testament

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.080
are not strictly just isolated to His first coming.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.400
In fact, there are many prophecies

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.440
with regard to His second coming.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.860
And we find that when the fullness of time was come,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.680
that God sent forth His Son, born of a virgin.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.519
Why?

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.680
For the purpose of dying on the cross of Calvary.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.319
He was the Lamb that was slain

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.699
before the foundation of the world.

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:26.559
Why was it necessary?

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.360
Because if He didn't, we'd be lost forever.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.319
We'd have to pay for our own sin.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.279
Sin carries, listen, we're all sinners.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.519
All have sin and come short of the glory of God.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.160
And sin carries with it a penalty.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.919
A payment must be made.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:44.680
I'm thankful that Jesus came the first time.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.459
I'm thankful that when He came the first time,

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.360
He fulfilled that which He was to do.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.879
I'm thankful that He declared on the cross of Calvary,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.800
it is finished.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.639
Amen?

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.839
And He was buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:00.839
and then He rose triumphantly,

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.480
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.239
But I want you to understand that in John 14,

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.759
before we ever get to the death,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.899
the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.759
that Jesus, in this portion of Scripture,

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.080
is encouraging His followers, His disciples.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.279
We find that it's in the 13th chapter of the book of John

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.919
that Jesus demonstrated and displayed for them

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.160
service and ministry and being a servant.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.339
And of course, through washing the feet of the disciples,

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.899
He showed them, demonstrated for them,

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.639
the importance of being a servant.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.460
We find that near the end of the 13th chapter

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.820
of the book of John, that Jesus is continuing

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.059
to reveal to them that soon He would go to the cross

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.600
and that He would die on that cross.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.919
We understand that these men, as they walked with Him,

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.880
that as He began to reveal these things

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.720
and give them further insight as to all that was going on,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.440
notice in chapter 13 and verse number 31 that Jesus,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.479
He says, now is the Son of Man glorified

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.919
and God is glorified in Him.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.600
How is this going to happen?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.160
Well, if you read chapter 17,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.520
you understand it was through going to the cross.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.600
We find, no doubt, that the message

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.720
that had been received by these disciples

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440
at the end of chapter 13 was a message

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.139
that brought them troubled hearts.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.399
How do we know that?

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.080
Well, because Jesus begins John 14 and verse number one

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.080
by saying this, let not your heart be troubled.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.679
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.880
You believe in God, believe also in Me.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.880
And then He says this, in My Father's house

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.300
are many mansions.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.320
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.399
And then notice where He says,

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.800
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.639
Now, I'm thankful that there are many things

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.160
that Jesus, after His ascension, is doing.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.880
One of those things that He's doing

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.320
is He's making intercession for us, amen?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.559
One of those things that He's doing

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.080
is He's our advocate, according to 1 John chapter number two,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.179
and I'm thankful that He's our great high priest

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.759
and He is fulfilling those ministries.

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.720
But we find here in this passage of Scripture

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.359
that He says, I go to prepare a place for you.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.799
And as I think about this preparation,

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.519
we find that the text does not end there.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.359
He says in verse number three, and if I go.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:27.600
Now, He just told him He was going, right?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.760
And then He says, if I go, He says,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.359
and prepare a place for you.

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:36.359
Notice these words, I will come again.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.440
I will come again and receive you unto Myself,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.600
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.040
Isn't that a precious promise of the Word of God?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.880
If you're taking notes,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.959
I just titled the message this morning,

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.440
I will come again.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.239
I will come again.

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:00.720
We understand the interactions

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.079
that we have humanly speaking in our relationships

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.200
and times in which we'll depart,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.119
we'll go maybe just to the store,

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.359
maybe to the office, maybe we go on a business trip,

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:10.480
whatever it may be, and we'll say,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.519
we'll see you when we get back.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:15.160
The idea of that statement is that you're planning

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.239
to return, now we know and we understand,

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:21.079
we can read accounts and stories of those that never returned.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:25.040
They did not ever complete that which was to be completed.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.480
They never returned, why?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.559
Because death knocked upon their door

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.079
and they never were able to return.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.600
But I want you to understand something

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200
about the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.920
when He says to His disciples, I will come again,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.359
the reality, if you're taking notes,

00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:40.519
just think about this, the simplicity of the promise.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:42.239
This is a simple promise.

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.880
There's nothing that's complex about the promise

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.279
that we find here in John chapter number 14,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.440
but man, this is a wonderful promise.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.640
And we think about the way in which God gives us

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.720
in His word these wonderful promises

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.079
and Peter will refer to them as exceeding great

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.079
and precious promises.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.839
We consider the simplicity of this promise

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.920
and he says, I will come again.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.779
And we understand that throughout the word of God,

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.519
you will be sure of this one thing

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:14.000
that God always does what He says He will do.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.679
Always.

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:16.880
He says, I will come again,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.519
you can guarantee that He's going to return.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.200
There are many people in our land,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.640
there are many people throughout history

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.760
that have sought to make commitments

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.760
and to give some sort of a word to someone

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.440
and make some type of promise

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.600
that they were not in of themselves able to fulfill.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.720
But I want you to understand that God Almighty

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.799
is able to fulfill everything that He's ever said.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.640
And when He says, I will come again,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.799
that ought to bring great hope and great joy

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.320
to the heart of every child of God.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.760
The reality is that Paul, as he's speaking

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.279
and ministering to Titus,

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.119
he says that we're looking for that blessed hope

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.720
and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.440
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.760
We understand something about that word hope.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.320
It's not the context in which oftentimes today

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.000
we use the word hope.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Today we use the word hope as just a wishful type of thing

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.920
I hope this is going to happen.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.399
I hope that's going to happen.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.720
No, no, biblical hope is something that is based upon,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.079
founded upon, secured on what God says.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.160
It is an expectation.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.480
I believe that the simplicity of this promise

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.320
will bring confidence to every child of God.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.160
You think about the confidence that we have

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.279
that one day, even as they sang that song this morning,

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:42.000
listen, Jesus is coming again and we don't know the hour,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.440
we don't know the day,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.239
but we're to live with a level of confidence,

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:49.279
understanding that our God rules and reigns

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.519
and He is in control.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.160
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.640
And oh, when He comes,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.679
what a glorious day that'll be.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.279
Many over the years,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.559
I know Brother Mershon uses the phraseology often,

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:05.559
I'm not looking for the undertaker,

00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:07.839
I'm looking for the upper taker.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:11.559
I'm looking for, listening for that trumpet, amen?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.079
The song, I think it was that second verse

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.880
as they sang this morning that special about,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.440
I can almost hear the father say,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.399
son, go get your children, right?

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.839
Listening for that trumpet,

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.040
I don't know who it was that wrote the song,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.279
listen for the trumpet.

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.480
I know the first time I ever heard it, Ron Hamilton,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.359
I'm not sure if he wrote that song,

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.799
but I heard him sing that song.

00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:32.760
And oh, how we're to listen for the trumpet

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.559
because it will sound and the dead in Christ

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.119
shall be raised, will be changed, amen?

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:40.159
And you think about the confidence that we have

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.840
as we live life and we understand

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.840
that our Savior is coming again.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.599
Think about these disciples

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:51.119
that had hearts that were troubled, troubled hearts.

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:53.840
What do we need in the midst of turmoil and trouble?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.119
We need a word that will bring confidence,

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.919
a word that will bring calm,

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.520
a word that will bring assurance.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.679
And we find that Jesus gave just that word.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.520
He said, listen, I understand that your hearts are troubled

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.760
but let not your heart be troubled.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:10.559
And He then gives them this wonderful promise

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:12.640
about His departure.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.760
Of course, later He would give them other insights

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.080
with regard to His need to go to the cross of Calvary.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.719
He said that it's expedient for you that I go.

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:24.719
It was necessary, it was advantageous

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:27.440
that He go to the cross of Calvary for human beings.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.599
And we understand all that was accomplished.

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:34.400
But when He made that statement, I will come again.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.280
I want you to consider the impact

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.760
that those words would have upon the disciples

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.880
and the impact that those words ought to have

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.479
upon you and upon me.

00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:48.520
We think about the simplicity of the promise

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.359
that brings confidence,

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.520
but it brings a measure of expectation.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.799
It brings a measure of expectation.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:55.200
I wonder this morning,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.559
I wonder as we go through life,

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:59.840
I wonder how often we are...

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.880
I'm mindful of the fact that Jesus may come back today.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880
I preached a message two Sunday mornings ago

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.080
about being ready for revival,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.180
and I spoke about the statement

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.480
that often the question that will be asked,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.920
are you ready?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.520
And I said this in that message by way of introduction,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.480
that the question requires context.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.800
Am I ready for what?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.120
Well, this morning, I asked the question

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.600
within the context of the Lord's return.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.400
Are you ready?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.080
It would be wonderful if He came

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.560
before I got done preaching this morning.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.120
I mean, seriously.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.880
Those guys up there in Pennsylvania

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.880
that are expecting me to come and preach,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.040
I don't think they'd be upset for one second.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.880
Why? Because we'd be with the Lord.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.560
It'd be awesome, amen?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.400
Listen, He could come at any moment,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.240
and the question that we must ask ourselves this morning

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.520
is are we ready?

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.680
The expectation that this promise gives.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.360
I mean, think about the disciples

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.040
when they're hearing this message,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.040
and they're receiving this simple promise

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.560
that Jesus says, I will come again.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.440
Well, when?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.800
We understand that in Acts,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.000
they begin to inquire,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.120
and they want to know when He's going to set up His kingdom.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.760
Turn over, in fact, to Acts 1,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.320
and I want you to notice what is said

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.720
in this passage of Scripture,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.480
and this is after the death and burial

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.600
and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.160
It's after He made Himself known to those,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.040
and it made many appearances

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.340
by many infallible proofs, the Bible tells us.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.020
We find that we come to Acts 1.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.820
It's recorded for us also at the end of the book of Luke,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.180
and the record that's given to us here

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.060
is really the ascension of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.260
When He ascends and goes back to heaven,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.860
and I want you to think about the words

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.060
that Jesus speaks to His disciples here.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.340
He tells them in verse number seven, in verse six,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.860
it says, when they therefore were come together,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.100
they asked of Him, saying,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.980
Lord, wilt Thou at this time

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.340
restore again the kingdom to Israel?

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.180
And He said unto them,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.540
it is not for you to know the times or the seasons

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.140
which the Father hath put in His own power,

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.240
but ye shall receive power

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.220
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.420
And ye shall be witnesses unto Me,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.420
both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.460
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.820
And then the Bible says this in verse number nine,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.860
and when He had spoken these things,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.500
while they beheld, He was taken up.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.580
Can you imagine?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.260
I mean, Jesus is there having conversation

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.260
with His disciples.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.300
They're speaking and they're asking Him

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.460
about the restoration of the kingdom.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.500
Will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.420
And Jesus speaks to them and says,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.020
listen, it's not for you to know the times or the seasons.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.700
He tells them, here's your duty,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.300
here's your responsibility.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.740
You shall receive power

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.100
after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.620
And you're going to be witnesses.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.780
We're commissioned to go and preach the gospel

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.460
to every creature.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.540
And we find that here He listed as being Jerusalem

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.900
and Judea and Samaria and the uttermost part of the earth.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.580
And while He's speaking those very words

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.420
and while the disciples are listening to Him speak,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.740
the Bible says that they beheld

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.100
and it says that He was taken up.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.940
Can you imagine?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.220
I mean, honestly, can you put yourself there

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.860
and see as Jesus had just given

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.260
these last words of instruction

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.100
and now He's ascending up out of their sight.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.460
He's taken up, the Bible continues and says this,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.460
and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.540
Wow.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.380
Wow.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.020
He was there speaking to them.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.300
And then He rose, He was ascended up

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.500
and then the cloud received Him

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.220
and no longer could they see.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.460
And the Bible tells us,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.660
and you and I would probably do the very same thing

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.300
in verse number 10.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.700
The disciples, notice what it says.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.580
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.980
as He went up.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.380
You and I'd probably do the same thing, wouldn't we?

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.380
I mean, it'd be an awesome sight, right?

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.260
I mean, man, He was just talking to us

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.060
and now He's ascending up out of our sight

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.900
and we stand there gazing up into heaven

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.060
and watching this scene that has just transpired

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.100
before our very eyes.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.940
And the Bible tells us here in this portion of Scripture

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.380
that these angels, these two men stood by them

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.380
in white apparel and notice what they say.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.700
Ye men of Galilee,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.620
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.780
And then notice this confirmation of the promise

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.060
that Jesus gave in John 14.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.820
This same Jesus,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.380
which has taken up from you into heaven,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.380
notice, shall so come in like manner

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.380
as ye have seen Him go into heaven.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.020
He said in John 14, I will come again.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.740
And now these very disciples that were there

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.940
and heard the Word in John 14

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.180
are now watching as Jesus has ascended to heaven

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.700
and the cloud receives Him out of their sight

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.740
and the angels come and speak to them

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.540
and the angels said, hey, why are you standing here?

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.540
Why are you gazing up into heaven?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.220
Don't you know that the same Jesus,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.940
not another Jesus, the same Jesus in bodily form,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.540
just as He rose from the dead,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.100
just as He ascended to heaven,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.500
this same Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.060
shall so come in like manner.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.420
Do you think for a moment

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.860
that perhaps these disciples

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.180
had a bell kind of ring off in their head?

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.500
You ever hear something

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.300
and maybe you kind of had forgotten about that,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.140
whatever that is?

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.060
I mean, think about what has transpired

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.540
over the last, let's say, what, six weeks,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.420
seven weeks in the lives of the disciples

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.340
because He showed Himself alive for 40 days.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.500
And you think about all of these events

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.500
that had transpired from John 14 until Acts 1.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.460
And over these weeks of time,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.500
all of these things that had transpired,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.300
perhaps that promise that had been given in John 14,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:15.100
now as it's repeated, it's confirmed here in Acts 1,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.620
that light bulb kind of goes off, right?

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.220
Man, He's coming again.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.740
This is what He mentioned in John 14.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.460
Remember that when the disciples,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.620
remember, they had forgotten

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.940
that He said He was gonna rise again.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.020
If you look at John 2, He says,

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.180
if you destroy this temple, I'll rebuild it in three days.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.300
And He spoke of His own resurrection.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.900
They had forgotten that until when?

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.700
Until resurrection morning.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.180
And then all of a sudden they remember,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.380
oh yeah, Jesus told us He was gonna rise again.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.100
Well, Jesus told them He's gonna come again.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.940
And now as He's ascended out of their sight,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.940
these angels repeat, confirm,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.220
this promise that He's coming again.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.940
Do you think that it gave the disciples

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.540
a level of not only confidence,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.940
but a measure of expectation?

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.100
I mean, if you read the book of Acts,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.660
I believe that you're reading as the Holy Spirit of God,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.140
as God worked through His people,

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.900
you're reading about a people

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.900
that were expecting the return of the Lord.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.540
They were living in expectancy.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.620
They were living that Jesus could,

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.220
we don't know when He's coming back.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.460
He didn't give us the date or the time.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.180
And so He just said He's coming again.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.300
And so therefore, I'm living in that state of expectancy.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.860
I'm expecting that He could return at any time.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.460
And if we're expecting that He could return at any time,

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.820
the question that must be answered is, are you ready?

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.460
Are you ready for His return?

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.100
Are you ready?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.980
Look over at 2 Peter, if you will.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.500
It's a verse of scripture that we're familiar with,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.460
but I wanna focus on this verse

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.660
just for a moment here this morning.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.300
And I want you to just allow it to sink in.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.700
Remember here in 2 Peter 3,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.980
actually begin reading in verse number one.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.140
We'll take a little time here

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.820
and look through these first several verses

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.220
in 2 Peter 3, but notice the Bible says this,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.780
"'This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.380
"'in both which I stir up your pure minds

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.080
"'by way of remembrance.'"

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.820
Listen, it's good for us to be reminded of some things.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.660
Amen?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.880
Peter's basically saying this to the disciple

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.520
or to those that he's writing to.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.640
He's saying, listen, I'm not writing anything new to you.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.380
I'm reminding you of some things.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.160
I'm reminding you.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.440
In fact, he mentions that even as he writes

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.580
the book of 1 Peter, that he was stirring up their minds

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.400
and he was trying to help them remember some things.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.420
And we find here, it says this in verse number two,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.040
"'That ye may be mindful of the words

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.700
"'which were spoken before by the holy prophets

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.980
"'and of the commandment of us, the apostles,

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.040
"'of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.180
"'that there shall come in the last days scoffers

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.340
"'walking after their own lust.'"

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.300
And notice what they're going to say

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.020
according to verse number four,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.300
where is the promise of His coming?

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.460
Isn't it interesting to you that the scoffers

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.700
are aware of the promise that God has made?

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.020
The scoffers are aware of it,

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.220
but because of the length of time

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.300
between the promise given and the promise fulfilled,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.780
there will be scoffers, mockers, that will say,

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.540
where is the promise of His coming?

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.700
For since the fathers fell asleep,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.340
all things continue as they were

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.820
from the beginning of the creation.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.740
And then notice this statement in verse number five.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.300
The Bible says, for this,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.980
they willingly are ignorant of.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.620
You know, it's sad that we've come into contact

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.900
with individuals that are willingly ignorant.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.180
They just don't want to know the truth.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.260
It's not that the truth isn't available.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.540
It's not even perhaps that you haven't tried

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.780
to present the truth,

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.260
but they just don't want the truth.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.620
Of this, they are willingly ignorant.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.220
It's not that the Scriptures don't declare

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.020
what Peter is getting ready to say.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.380
Remember, he says I'm going to remind you

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.420
of some things.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.020
This is not something new.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.500
Notice what he says in verse 5,

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.940
that by the word of God,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.260
the heavens were of old

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.820
and the earth standing out of the water

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.260
and in the water,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.260
whereby the world that then was

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.780
being overflowed with water perished.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.140
What's he speaking of?

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.380
The flood.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.820
He's speaking of the flood.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.180
You go back to Genesis 6-8

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.180
and you read about the flood

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.420
that God of course is judging.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.260
Why?

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.180
Because of the wickedness,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.540
the sinfulness,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.460
their thoughts and imaginations

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.980
are evil continually

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.420
and God as a righteous, holy, just God

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.060
says they're going to be judged.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.820
Now because He's gracious and merciful,

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.660
He has Noah, a preacher of righteousness,

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.500
preach for 120 years.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.740
There was safety in one place.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.460
That was in the ark.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.060
It's interesting to note that the ark

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.900
had but one door.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.900
There's only one way to enter into the ark.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.540
There was only safety in one place

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.420
and that's in the ark.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.500
And when the floods came,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.460
when the rains came,

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.780
when the deep was opened up,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.300
no doubt in my mind,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.020
there were individuals

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.820
that had wished they had listened

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.740
and they had gotten in the ark.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.260
The Bible doesn't tell us this,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.220
but I do not believe that it's a far stretch

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.500
to have the idea that perhaps

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.580
when those rains came,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.060
that there were people that sought

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.660
to get into the ark.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.820
But you know what the Bible tells us?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.500
That God shut the door.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.620
God shut the door.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.700
You know, those people didn't know

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.820
when the rain was going to come.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.020
They didn't even know what rain was.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.180
Right?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.900
You study it, you understand it.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.900
Noah says it's going to rain.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.020
You're crazy, Noah.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.460
They don't even know what rain is.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.700
But the rain came.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.620
And Peter says here,

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.300
they're willingly ignorant of this.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.660
Listen, judgment came, the flood.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.340
Jesus is coming.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.100
They said, where is the promise of his coming?

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.940
Notice verse seven,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.860
but the heavens and the earth,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.740
which are now by the same word

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.740
are kept in store,

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.900
reserved under fire against the day of judgment

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.380
and perdition of ungodly men.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.380
There will be a judgment again.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.140
And we see that detailed in more

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.220
in verse number 11.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.180
But I want you to notice in verse number eight,

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.580
the Bible says, but beloved,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.460
be not ignorant of this one thing,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.780
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.220
And a thousand years as one day.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.060
Now, why is that the case?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.780
It's because our God transcends time.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.180
He's outside of time.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.220
Now, we are controlled by time, are we not?

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.300
We have appointments and we have calendars

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.820
and we have clocks and we have watches,

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.300
and we're controlled by time,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.580
some of us more than others,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.660
but we understand the way that time operates

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.260
in our society.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.020
And the reality is that God is outside of time.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.660
He says, listen,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.780
I don't want you to be ignorant of this one thing.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.300
I want you to be informed.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.620
I want you to understand this

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.860
because they're saying,

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.780
where is the promise of his coming?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.780
And though it's been over nearly now 2000 years

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.060
since Jesus ascended into heaven,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.460
it does not mean that there's any less

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.740
of the promise, any less confidence,

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.620
any less expectation that we have.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.900
In fact, our expectation increases even more

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.940
with each passing day

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.700
because we're a day closer, amen?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.340
And here we find that he says,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.940
I don't want you to be ignorant of this thing.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.860
I want you to understand that our God is outside of time,

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.020
that one day is as a thousand years

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.860
and a thousand years as a day.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.180
And so for us this morning in 2021,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.580
it's been nearly 2000 years

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.660
since Jesus Christ went to that old rugged cross

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.900
and he bled and died and he was buried and he rose again.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.340
And then after he'd made himself known and appeared,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.820
he ascended to heaven giving that promise.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.660
And here we are nearly 2000 years later,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.020
but on God's timetable,

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.100
according to what we see here,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.700
it's just a couple of days, right?

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.620
Because God is outside of time.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.060
I want you to understand the significance

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.260
of verse number nine.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.980
The Bible says this,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.980
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.020
as some men count slackness.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.620
Aren't you thankful that our God

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.020
is not slack concerning his promise?

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.500
Listen, there will be scoffers,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.180
there will be individuals that say,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.500
hey, where is the promise of his coming?

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.260
I mean, you guys are preaching about

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.660
and you're singing about

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.900
and you're living with this expectation

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.660
that there'll be scoffers and mockers

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.860
that say, where is the promise of his coming?

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.820
And we just reassure and comfort ourselves

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.580
and have that confidence that our God,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.860
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.140
as some men count slackness.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.980
No doubt in your life and in my life,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.700
there have been times that we've made a promise,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.100
a commitment to someone that we just flat out

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.420
were not able to fulfill.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.980
It's not the case with God.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.100
It's not the case.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.260
Notice the conclusion of verse number nine,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.140
but is long suffering to us word.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.420
Aren't you thankful that he's long suffering?

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.380
And then it says this,

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.780
not willing that any should perish,

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.900
but that all should come to repentance.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.100
There's some lost people that need to be saved.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.780
I want you to just for a moment, think about this.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.140
Think about the day that you got saved.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.900
How many of you know the day that you got saved?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.420
You remember, I mean, maybe not the exact day,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.820
but you remember the time period in which you got saved.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.420
I remember I got saved on August 31st, 1997.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.940
I was 17 years old when I got saved,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.860
senior in high school.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.260
Each of you, you have a day

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.700
in which you trust that Christ is your savior.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.140
Let me ask you this question.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.420
When you think about that day

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.300
that Jesus saved your soul,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.020
aren't you thankful he didn't come the day before?

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.940
You ever think about that?

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.580
What if he came back on August 15th, 1997

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.180
as before I got saved?

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.380
I'd heard the gospel, but I'd rejected the gospel.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.700
I'd heard it for a couple of years at that point,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.820
but I never accepted it.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.980
I never trusted Christ as my savior.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.500
And we can go around the room and say,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.260
when did you get saved, when did you get saved,

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.100
and you know that date, that time frame, the year maybe.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.100
Say, man, aren't you thankful

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.100
that God didn't come back before then?

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.300
See, because he's not slack concerning his promise

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.340
that some men cannot slackness,

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.900
but he's long-suffering to us-ward,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.620
not willing that any should perish,

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.580
but that all should come to repentance.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.380
There's going to come a day that he's going to return.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.420
I don't know what day that is,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.260
but I'll say this, for those that have heard the gospel,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.020
they've heard that Jesus loved them,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.620
that they're a sinner,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.940
and they heard that Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.620
went to the cross of Calvary,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.260
he shed his blood, he was crucified on that cruel cross,

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.780
and he was buried in a borrowed tomb,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.740
and he rose in victory, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.700
He wants you to be saved.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.900
Paul said this, today is the day of salvation, amen?

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.260
And you think about the significance of this promise

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.060
that he's long-suffering to us-ward.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.540
I'm not sure when that last person

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.860
before the tribulation hour

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.220
is going to place their faith and trust in Christ.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.260
I'm not sure when that's going to happen,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.820
but I can be confident and I can have great joy

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.980
in knowing that our God is not willing

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.260
that any should perish,

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.820
but that all should come to repentance.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.300
For God so loved the world

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.700
that he gave his only begotten Son,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.100
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.660
but have everlasting life.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.100
Why is it that we work on putting Bibles together

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.380
during our scripture assembly?

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.220
Why is it that we send money

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.980
to have Bibles printed in Samoa?

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.619
Because we want them to hear the wonderful message

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:02.619
that God so loved the world.

00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:05.380
We want them to understand those that are in darkness,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.340
those in whom the God of this world

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.820
hath blinded their minds,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.740
lest the light of the glorious Gospel

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.900
should shine in unto them.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.380
We want them to know Jesus saves.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.780
Amen?

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.619
Why?

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:19.020
Because there's a real hell.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.140
There's a lake of fire.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.180
And the Bible tells us in Revelation 20

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.100
that the books are open.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.940
And whosoever is not found written in the book of life

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.559
was cast into the lake of fire.

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:33.960
This is the second death.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.800
Oh man, that's sobering.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.040
Is it not?

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.640
Speaking of the simplicity of the promise,

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.119
getting back to the truth

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:52.040
that our God is not slack concerning His promise,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.680
it brings confidence, it brings expectation.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.119
I spent much time dealing with the simplicity

00:29:58.119 --> 00:29:59.720
of the promise, but I want you to understand

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.320
the significance of the promise.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.660
and the significance of the promise.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.500
Why is it that we call it the blessed hope?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.840
Why is it that we sing and rejoice?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.000
Why is it that when we sing,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.640
coming again,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.840
and Dean is up here leading

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.180
and getting excited,

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.580
why is it that when Holly and Joseph

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.940
sang that song this morning,

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.980
when they practiced, I said,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.100
hey, listen, don't get bothered if I join you.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100
I know the song.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.700
It doesn't mean I'm going to sing it on tune,

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.820
but I know the song.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.020
And I said, don't get nervous

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.320
if I start singing behind you.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.860
Why does it cause us to be excited?

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.060
Why does it bring joy?

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.640
Because there's some significance

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.820
about this promise.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.280
Turn to 1 Thessalonians 4 if you will.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.780
I want you to first think about

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.020
the significance for us

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.900
as the people of God.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.400
In 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.280
in fact, much of that special

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.400
that Holly and Joseph sang this morning,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.440
you could look at 1 Thessalonians 4

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.400
verses 13-18 and you could see

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.920
how this particular portion of Scripture

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.040
had great influence upon the songwriter

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.080
who wrote that song.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.000
And we notice in this portion of Scripture,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.380
the Bible says this in verse number 13,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.800
but I would not have you

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.080
to be ignorant, brethren.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.200
We saw that in the book

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.080
of 2 Peter 3.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.240
Listen, God doesn't want people to be ignorant.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.580
He wants us to be informed.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.960
He's given us a precious book

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.740
so that we could know.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.000
He says, I would not that you be ignorant, brethren,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.680
concerning them which are asleep.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.580
Notice what he says,

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.500
that you sorrow not even as others

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.360
which have no hope.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.900
You know that we're living in the midst

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.940
of a people that are hopeless.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.820
They have no hope.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.380
The fear of death has gripped,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.080
literally gripped the lives of billions.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.180
We see it all around us today.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.100
Do we not?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.220
In these last 18 months,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.180
people that never gave really two thoughts

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.300
about dying have been absolutely controlled

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.620
by the fear of dying.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.780
Why? Because they're hopeless.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.340
They don't know what's going to happen

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.220
when they die.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.940
I don't fear death.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.900
According to Hebrews chapter 2,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.580
one of the things that the Lord accomplished

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.580
on the cross of Calvary

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.380
is He delivered those that had the fear of death

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.020
from the fear of death.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.540
Amen?

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.740
And notice He says this,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.340
I'm thankful that we have hope.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.300
Notice when He says,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.220
but if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.740
we believe that.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.700
Even so, them also which sleep are dead,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.900
that's the word, it's what it means,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.660
in Jesus will God bring with Him.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.660
Remember when Jesus tells the disciples

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.180
in John 11 that Lazarus was asleep.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.900
And they said, man, if he's asleep,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.460
let him sleep because he'd been sick.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.220
And Jesus had to speak plainly to them

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.940
and said, Lazarus is dead.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.140
That's a common vernacular that they would use.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.380
And here He's speaking of those that died in Christ.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.980
It says this in v. 15,

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.460
for this we say unto you,

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.460
notice what He says,

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.380
by the word of the Lord.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.980
It's important for us to understand

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.540
that significant statement.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.380
This is not just Paul's opinion.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.300
We're not just sitting around a round table

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.700
saying, okay, what's your thought?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.860
What's your opinion on this?

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.860
And how about you?

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.100
What's your opinion on this?

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.820
No, no, no, we're not looking for opinions.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.620
We're looking for what thus saith the Lord.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.460
Amen?

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.300
You can find many opinions around our world today.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.340
You can find opinions,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.580
you go and have surveys,

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.140
and you can ask people what they need to do

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:30.980
to go to heaven.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.980
You can ask people all sorts of questions

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.900
about religion and so on and so forth.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:41.500
And there's a plurality of ideas that exist.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.300
The devil is not short on deception.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.140
But what does God say?

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.100
Paul says, I am telling you this,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.100
this we say unto you,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.220
by the word of the Lord.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.500
He actually says that we,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.620
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.700
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.540
You notice that in verse number 15,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.700
it's a level of confidence and certainty

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.500
that are alive and remain unto the coming Lord.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.020
He's going to come.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.380
And there's going to be a group,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.860
a generation of believers that are alive and remain

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.100
at the coming of the Lord.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.500
Wouldn't it be great if we're that generation?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.339
Amen?

00:34:17.339 --> 00:34:18.860
It'd be wonderful.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.020
And he says that we shall not prevent

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.740
or go before those that have died in Christ.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.100
Notice in verse 16,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.580
for the Lord himself,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.220
isn't that what the angel said in Acts 1?

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.700
This same Jesus,

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.860
which you've seen go into heaven,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.580
shall so come in like manner.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.420
He says this,

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.580
for the Lord himself,

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.339
it's a personal return,

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:42.260
shall descend from heaven with a shout.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.700
The voice of the archangel with the trump of God.

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.580
He says this,

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.660
the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:34:51.779 --> 00:34:54.940
I'm thankful that Jesus himself is coming to receive us.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.660
He could send an angel,

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.740
but he's coming himself.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.580
Isn't that wonderful?

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.420
It's sweet.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.420
It's precious.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.020
We see those that have died in Christ,

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.940
the reality is that we may not be the generation

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.779
that are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.

00:35:09.779 --> 00:35:10.619
Why?

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:12.580
Because the reality is just as David said,

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.500
remember when David was being hunted by Saul,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.339
and he says this,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.460
there's but a step between me and death.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.540
You know the reality is that for you and for me,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.580
there's but a step between us and death.

00:35:22.899 --> 00:35:25.420
Boast not thyself of tomorrow, Solomon says,

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.179
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:29.660
We have plans for tomorrow,

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.899
but we don't know if we're gonna live tomorrow.

00:35:31.899 --> 00:35:32.779
What is your life?

00:35:32.779 --> 00:35:34.660
It's but a vapor that appears for a little time

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.740
and then vanisheth away.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.820
That's what we find in the book of James

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.420
in the fourth chapter.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.899
And so we find here that as the truth is,

00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:46.420
we may die in Christ,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.140
we may die before the coming of the Lord.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.540
And if we do, we have this promise

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.500
that we're going to be raised first.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.779
Because those that are alive and remain

00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:56.860
shall not prevent them,

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.059
shall not go before them that are dead in Christ.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:01.619
The dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:03.940
Notice verse 17, then.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.300
And this is speaking to the generation that's still alive.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.820
And I hope it's my generation, I really do.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.220
Then we which are alive and remain

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.779
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:36:16.779 --> 00:36:18.460
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.339
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:26.179
Isn't that wonderful?

00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:27.940
He finishes the passage by saying this,

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.100
wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.660
Now think about the significance of that

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.580
where we started in John chapter number 14.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.179
Let not your heart be troubled, right?

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:41.899
And so God, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:44.380
He gave a word to those disciples

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.580
that had troubled hearts

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.500
that would cause them to have some confidence,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.460
but also cause them to have some comfort

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.380
for their troubled hearts.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.260
And here we find that Paul says,

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.740
wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.380
And we find here this morning,

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.940
that in fact, we could be that generation

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.140
that are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140
And the Bible tells us

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.580
that we will be caught up together with them.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.940
There's gonna be this great,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.300
I mean, it's amazing what's going to happen.

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:12.660
The dead in Christ are gonna rise first.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.339
By the way, this all happens in a moment

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:16.380
in the twinkling of an eye,

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.380
according to 1 Corinthians 15.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.940
I mean, just bam, that fast.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.619
According to 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:24.860
right here, the next passage,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.779
it says that he's gonna come like a thief in the night.

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:31.460
Okay, so it's just bam, it just takes place.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.740
But the dead in Christ are gonna rise first.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.460
Then we which are alive and remain

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.779
are gonna be caught up together.

00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:40.059
And the Bible says together with them in the clouds

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:42.260
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.580
Then it says this,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.220
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.700
Man, that's wonderful.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.700
That gives us a level of confidence.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.260
I mean, listen, this is a significant promise.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.140
It's a simple promise.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.179
But when you begin to study the whole of Scripture,

00:37:58.179 --> 00:37:59.660
you begin to dig into the Word of God,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.820
you say, listen, this promise is significant to me.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.380
This promise brings me joy and comfort

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.540
and confidence and expectation.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.260
This promise is going to influence and impact

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.260
the way that I live my life.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.100
Why?

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.300
Because He might come today.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.220
What a joy.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.300
We get to meet the Lord in the air.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.660
He said, I go to prepare a place for you.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.660
He says, if I go, I will come again

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.539
and receive you unto Myself,

00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:37.179
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:41.539
We have great confidence as the people of God.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.020
Gives us great joy.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.859
Listen, we've mentioned in the book of Hebrews

00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:46.700
in the 11th chapter

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.619
that we're just pilgrims and strangers.

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:50.539
We sing the song, this world is not my home,

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:52.299
I'm just a passing through.

00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:53.140
Amen?

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.100
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.940
Amen?

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.940
I'm going home one day.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.059
Listen, my citizenship is in heaven.

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.100
I'm an American citizen

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.660
and I'm thankful for the opportunity to be in this country

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.340
and to be a citizen of this country.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.539
But most importantly is that I'm a citizen of heaven.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.780
I'm a child of God.

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:15.820
And as a child of God, I have this great promise.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.059
Listen, you understand that this promise,

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:19.539
the significance of this promise

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:21.619
as we're looking here in this portion of Scripture

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:23.940
is that it's significant to me as a believer.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.299
But I want you to think about it for the unbeliever.

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:31.660
I want you to think about it for the truth that listen,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.580
God is not slack concerning His promise.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.059
He's not willing that any should perish,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.580
but that all should come to repentance.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.299
But we understand and we know this morning

00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:42.100
that not all people are saved.

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:45.700
There are two groups of people in the world.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.859
There are people that have been saved

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:48.500
that have been born again,

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.260
and there are people that are lost.

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:53.460
And by the way, all of the people that are saved

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.100
and born again were lost at one point.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.940
Amen?

00:39:58.179 --> 00:39:59.859
We were lost.

00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:02.299
We were dead in our sins and our transgressions.

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:08.459
trespasses. We too had no hope. But God, you read Ephesians 2, it'll cause you to rejoice

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:17.019
greatly in your salvation. But God, we understand there will be people that have rejected this

00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:23.579
message and they will enter into the tribulation. Specifically, I'm speaking of those that have,

00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:29.419
I believe, received, they've heard the message, but they've rejected the message. And the

00:40:29.419 --> 00:40:33.019
Bible tells us, I don't have time to read all of it, but in 2 Thessalonians chapter

00:40:33.019 --> 00:40:39.339
number 2, really verses 3-12, if I had the time I'd read the entirety of the portion

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:45.179
of Scripture that is before us. But he's speaking about the return of the Lord and the midpoint

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:49.459
of the tribulation is in full view in verse number 3. And he speaks about the fact that

00:40:49.459 --> 00:40:53.099
the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Listen, we see that, it's in verse number

00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:59.319
7, we see that in our society today. The mystery of iniquity doth already work. Some people

00:40:59.319 --> 00:41:02.599
are looking at what's taking place in our world today, in our country today, and they're

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:07.559
saying, things are falling apart! No, no, things are falling in place. You know why

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:12.879
things aren't falling apart? Because we serve the Lord God omnipotent. And he's in charge.

00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:17.999
The heathen rage, right? I mean, they set up their plans on how they're going to the

00:41:17.999 --> 00:41:22.479
kings of the earth, how they're going to overthrow, and God shall have them in derision. He laughs

00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:29.519
at them. Psalm 2, right? You just go over there and read it. Our God reigns and He rules.

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:34.799
There's no way that things are falling apart. It's that they're falling in place and God's

00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:39.999
plan and God's purpose will be fulfilled. We find that it says this in verse number

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:46.439
10 of 2 Thessalonians 2, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because

00:41:46.439 --> 00:41:51.599
they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Speaking of those that

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:55.479
had heard and rejected, it says in verse number 11, and for this cause God shall send

00:41:55.479 --> 00:42:00.079
them strong delusion that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believe

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:05.639
not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. Those are sad verses of Scripture, to be honest

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:12.639
with you. There are some people that think that they can play a game with God. They feel

00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:19.799
like that they can play with eternity. You know, I'm not really interested in trusting

00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:23.999
Christ as my Savior now, but if all these things really come to pass that you say are

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:30.479
going to come to pass then, I'll go ahead and trust Christ then. It's not going to happen.

00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:34.999
On the authority of the Word of God, it's not going to happen because God is going to

00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:41.199
send strong delusion and they're going to believe a lie. I don't know how it all works,

00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:45.319
but somehow they're going to believe that lie, the lie of the Antichrist, the lie of

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:50.759
the enemy. And so that's why it's so imperative that we understand that today is the day

00:42:50.759 --> 00:42:55.759
of salvation. That's why it's so imperative when we think about this promise of His return.

00:42:55.759 --> 00:43:01.999
Listen, the promise of His return is so significant for me. This simple promise is so significant

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:07.159
for me as a child of God and I rejoice greatly, but you know at the same time it causes my

00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:14.159
heart to be burdened for lost people. It causes my heart to be burdened for lost people.

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:20.959
One of the nights of the revival meeting, the conclusion of the message from Brother

00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:26.839
Edwards was that God would put a name on your heart, on my heart, and perhaps there's someone

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:31.479
that God has placed on your heart even then or maybe as you've continued to pray about

00:43:31.479 --> 00:43:37.079
it, but the reality is this, we know lost people. There's someone that you work with.

00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:41.839
There's maybe a relative. There's somebody that you know that's not saved. We don't look

00:43:41.879 --> 00:43:48.879
down upon them. We don't judge them. No, no, rather we pray for them and we desire to share

00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:56.319
with them the truth that they might be saved because we don't want them to come to the

00:43:56.639 --> 00:44:03.319
place of the rapture and when we're taken out of here and we're forever with the Lord

00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:09.559
that they are damned to believe a lie. And if you read about the tribulation, we understand

00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:12.839
the significance. I won't have time this morning to get into it of how that really

00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:17.119
is dealing with Israel again as a nation and all that's taken place with Jacob's trouble

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:20.839
and so on and so forth, but the reality is that you read about the tribulation in the

00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:26.279
book of Revelation, it is an awful period of time. You read about the judgments that

00:44:26.279 --> 00:44:29.639
are being poured out. You read about the death. Listen, they think we have a lot of death

00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:36.199
now with this pandemic. It is nothing in comparison to what's going to happen during the tribulation.

00:44:36.199 --> 00:44:43.199
They are going to collectively lose their minds. Honestly. You're going to go insane.

00:44:44.199 --> 00:44:51.199
Destruction. We don't glory in that. Knowing the terror of the Lord, what is it, 2 Corinthians

00:44:51.199 --> 00:44:56.119
chapter number 5? Turn over there if you will and I want you to think about what Paul says

00:44:56.119 --> 00:45:01.639
here in this portion of scripture because the reality this morning is that when we think

00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:06.319
about the significance of this promise that Jesus said, I will come again and those of

00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:10.839
us that have been born again, we rejoice greatly, but at the same time, we ought to be mindful

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:14.599
of those that have not yet been saved. It ought to motivate us. It ought to cause us

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:20.359
to have a passion for souls. The Bible, excuse me, the hymn writer said, give me a passion

00:45:20.359 --> 00:45:25.720
for souls, dear Lord, a passion to save the lost. Why? Because I understand their destination.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:32.039
I understand, listen, I'm thankful that my eternal destination is secure. I am kept

00:45:32.039 --> 00:45:38.679
by the power of God and if you've been saved, so are you. But what about the lost man? Verse

00:45:38.679 --> 00:45:44.659
10 of 2 Corinthians 5, for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:49.039
may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or

00:45:49.039 --> 00:45:58.839
bad. Notice this, knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are made

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:03.639
manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. We don't have

00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:07.519
time again to read through all of this, but notice what he says in verse number 14. We

00:46:07.519 --> 00:46:10.639
hear a great message from Brother Savalle on this verse of scripture, for the love of

00:46:10.639 --> 00:46:15.279
Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

00:46:15.279 --> 00:46:19.799
Notice verse 15, and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth

00:46:19.799 --> 00:46:23.839
live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. Notice verse number

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:29.919
20, now then we are ambassadors for Christ. Who is the we? It's those that have been born

00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:35.639
again. We see that in verse number 17, therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:39.500
Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new. And so those saved people

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:45.039
that are being written to, we are the ambassadors of Christ. And we notice the significance

00:46:45.039 --> 00:46:52.759
of verse number 21, for he hath made him, Jesus Christ, to be sin for us, who knew

00:46:52.759 --> 00:47:00.519
no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. How many of you know the song

00:47:00.519 --> 00:47:05.159
The Old Account Was Settled? It's a good one. I don't think it's in our hymnal, but man,

00:47:05.159 --> 00:47:09.759
The Old Account Was Settled long ago. And if you get a good bass that sings that song,

00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:13.919
man, they can get into that long ago, I settled it all, and so on and so forth. Man, it's

00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:19.759
a great song. The Old Account Was Settled long ago. You know the significance of that

00:47:19.759 --> 00:47:26.079
transaction, what took place? On the day that you got saved, on the day that I got saved,

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:30.839
if there's somebody under the sound of my voice today, whether they're here locally

00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:39.119
or they're watching via live stream, that transaction could take place today. I have

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:45.759
nothing to offer. All of my good works are as filthy rags, according to Isaiah. For by

00:47:45.759 --> 00:47:49.199
grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It's the gift of God, not

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:56.440
of works, lest any man should boast. I understand that I have nothing to offer. I'm just a sinner

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:05.000
in need of the Savior. I'm just a sinner, and my sin condemns me. The Bible tells us

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:13.239
that he that believeth not is condemned already in John chapter number 3. Condemned. For the

00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:25.959
wages of sin is death. But there's a God in heaven who loves His creation. And all the

00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:34.199
way back in the garden, the picture that was first given of the sacrifice of an animal

00:48:34.199 --> 00:48:40.519
for blood to be shed so that Adam and Eve could be properly covered, thus giving us

00:48:40.519 --> 00:48:45.719
for all of that Old Testament history, the picture after picture, the Passover would

00:48:45.719 --> 00:48:51.719
come on the scene in the book of Exodus, and all that would take place, the significance

00:48:51.719 --> 00:48:57.979
that Christ, our Passover, would come. And He would die in our place. When we have nothing

00:48:57.979 --> 00:49:04.700
to offer, God commendeth His love toward us in that while we're yet sinners, Christ

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:11.859
died for us. I don't deserve it. That's why it's called mercy. That's why it's called

00:49:11.859 --> 00:49:19.539
grace. If we deserved it, it wouldn't be grace or mercy, right? It'd be what we deserve.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:27.779
But honestly, what we deserve is hell. Because we're guilty. We're guilty. But God who is

00:49:27.779 --> 00:49:35.779
rich in mercy. Ephesians 2, I think it's verse 4, maybe verse 5. God who is rich in

00:49:35.779 --> 00:49:46.260
mercy. What a joy. And I have nothing to offer, but because of His death, burial, and glorious

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:55.659
resurrection, He who knew no sin, He was made sin for us. The innocent died for the guilty.

00:49:55.659 --> 00:50:02.299
The payment was made. And it was accepted. And Jesus offers

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:12.979
us His righteousness, because all of my righteousness is filthy rags, not acceptable. But God says,

00:50:12.979 --> 00:50:20.819
I love you so much, I died for you, and now I offer you my righteousness, that we, that

00:50:20.819 --> 00:50:27.259
we are now able to have the righteousness of God. We call it the imputed righteousness

00:50:27.259 --> 00:50:31.379
as placed upon our account. When God looks at me, when He looks at you, if you've been

00:50:31.379 --> 00:50:37.699
saved this morning, He sees the righteousness of His Son, that we're washed in the blood.

00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:44.099
We sing the song, Are You Washed? in the blood, the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb. Isaiah

00:50:44.099 --> 00:50:49.739
says, Hey, come, let us reason together, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white

00:50:49.739 --> 00:50:55.559
as snow. Listen, this morning I'm thankful for the wonderful promise, I will come again.

00:50:55.559 --> 00:51:01.399
I will come again. It's a simple promise, it's a significant promise, and we can rejoice

00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:06.079
greatly and we can know this morning, listen, I don't know all that's going to happen between

00:51:06.079 --> 00:51:11.299
now and then, but I know that one day I'm going to go be with my Lord. There's a whole

00:51:11.299 --> 00:51:16.559
lot of people that we meet along the way that have not yet placed their faith and trust

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:23.839
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary. Oh, that God would motivate us to be bold

00:51:23.839 --> 00:51:29.119
in preaching the gospel, that we would be His ambassadors, as it says in verse number

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:34.239
20 of this passage of Scripture, that we would understand the terror of the Lord and therefore

00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:42.919
persuade men. God would work in the heart and life of the one that may be under the

00:51:42.919 --> 00:51:47.679
sound of my voice that does not know Christ as their Savior. If they were to die today,

00:51:47.679 --> 00:51:53.679
they have no idea where they'd go. Oh, that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:51:53.679 --> 00:52:00.079
The Holy Spirit of God takes the Word of God and works, convinces of sin, of Christ's righteousness

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:06.239
and of judgment to come. So I place my faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible

00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:11.159
says, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Listen, Jesus

00:52:11.159 --> 00:52:17.439
is coming again. But He said, listen, I'm coming again, but you have a job, you have

00:52:17.439 --> 00:52:23.079
a responsibility. Work, amen, for the night is coming, the songwriter said, when no man

00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:27.199
shall work. So we have an opportunity. You know something that's interesting? When I

00:52:27.199 --> 00:52:31.439
go to heaven, when you go to heaven, whether that's through the rapture or through death,

00:52:31.439 --> 00:52:37.759
I will never have another opportunity to share the gospel with someone. Only now do I have

00:52:37.759 --> 00:52:41.719
that opportunity. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank

00:52:41.719 --> 00:52:52.719
you for the Word of God. Thank you for the truth of your return. I will come again. I

00:52:52.719 --> 00:52:58.199
thank you for that promise. It's a simple promise, but oh, how impactful, how significant

00:52:58.199 --> 00:53:06.199
this promise is. Perhaps this morning, there's one that does not have that same level of

00:53:06.199 --> 00:53:15.599
joy and excitement about this promise because they've never trusted Christ as their Savior.

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:21.679
Oh God, I pray that you'd work in their heart and life. Help them to understand their need

00:53:21.679 --> 00:53:31.319
for the Savior. I pray that before it's eternally too late, that they'd get saved. I pray for

00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:38.959
those of us that have been born again, Lord, I pray that you'd help us this morning to

00:53:38.959 --> 00:53:46.839
live with that expectation. As we observe the Lord's Supper, we're mindful of 1 Corinthians

00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:53.039
11, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Help us to live that life of expectancy every

00:53:53.039 --> 00:53:59.119
day, to be mindful that today could be the day. And Lord, I pray that you'd help us to

00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:07.359
live in such a way that we would, knowing the terror of the Lord, persuade men, that

00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:12.679
we would be your ambassadors, your representatives, that we would be faithful proclaimers of the

00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:20.599
gospel, conveyors of the love of Christ. Use us, God, for your honor and glory. I pray

00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:25.479
that you'd work in the time of invitation. You know the need of each one that's here.

00:54:25.479 --> 00:54:31.919
I pray that you'd graciously work and move, and God, you'd be glorified. For it's in Christ's

00:54:31.919 --> 00:54:35.759
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. No one's looking

00:54:35.759 --> 00:54:39.879
around. Kimberly will play quietly on the piano. It's our custom at the end of our services

00:54:39.879 --> 00:54:46.119
to have an invitation where we invite you to respond. The Lord, I've spoken to your

00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:49.000
heart this morning. Maybe you're not sure of heaven. We'd love to take a Bible and show

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.239
you I can know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe this morning you just want to

00:54:54.239 --> 00:54:57.879
come and thank God for the wonderful promise that He's coming again. Maybe you want to

00:54:57.879 --> 00:55:05.679
ask Him to help you to be found faithful, to live with that expectancy of His soon return.

00:55:05.679 --> 00:55:07.599
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
