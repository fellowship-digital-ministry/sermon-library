1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,139
this morning, Psalm 119 this morning, as we continue with our series here on Sunday mornings,

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,140
Great is the Lord.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,640
And I'm thankful for God's greatness.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm thankful that we could stand and say, I know that the Lord is great.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,899
And at the very same time, we can say that his greatness is unsearchable because every

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:25,200
day that we walk with the Lord, we just find out how much greater he is than we thought

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,500
the day before.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
He is great.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,599
And I've said this often over the years, but today in your mind, you have God at a certain

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,639
place, elevate it high, holy and lifted up.

11
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:41,119
And you say God is great, but he's greater than what you can even imagine.

12
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,720
And it is such a wonderful thing to understand the greatness of God.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,439
We understand as we come to this portion of scripture over the last couple of weeks, we

14
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,279
have noted that God's greatness is revealed to us through the inspiration of his word

15
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,860
and the preservation of his word.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,580
And as we've studied those passages that led us last week to deal with the fact that because

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,779
all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and because God who is eternal promised to

18
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:17,540
preserve his word from just this generation and forever, that God's word is sufficient

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,540
and it is superior.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,180
And I am so thankful for those Bible truths.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,860
And this morning, as we look at this declaration of the psalmist, we find that the psalmist

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,500
then is going to declare in Psalm 119, a familiar verse of scripture in verse number 97,

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,940
O how love I thy law!

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,559
It thy law is my meditation all the day.

25
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:46,059
Over the next two weeks, today and next week, you see that it's a part one message.

26
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,379
Next week will be part two.

27
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:51,980
We're going to discuss this portion of scripture, Psalm 119, looking at a variety of verses

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,019
of scripture.

29
00:01:53,019 --> 00:02:00,580
But what I want to know is how the psalmist expresses his love for God's word.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,379
But then next week, that's what we're going to deal with this morning.

31
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,259
Next week we're going to examine the evidence of this claim.

32
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,460
You know, we can claim anything.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,979
But does the evidence support the claim?

34
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:21,539
I'll preach the message next week, but I will say this morning that absolutely the evidence

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,139
and the life of the psalmist supports the claim that he makes here in verse number 97,

36
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:30,259
O how love I thy law!

37
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:37,100
I want you to understand that we recognize this morning that we love God and we understand

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,139
that the book of Deuteronomy tells us that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all

39
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,139
thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

40
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:52,179
In fact, the psalmist declares in Psalm 31 and verse number 23, speaking of the saints

41
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:58,179
of God, it says this, O love the Lord, all ye his saints.

42
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:03,100
And then in Psalm 116 and verse number 1, the psalmist says this, I love the Lord because

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,259
he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

44
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,660
Of course, we're familiar with what John said in 1 John chapter number 4 and verse number

45
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,979
19 when he says that I love him, but we know that we love him, why?

46
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,740
Because he first loved us.

47
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,940
And I'm so thankful this morning that we love God and we should love God, and by the way,

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,460
there should be evidence of that claim as well.

49
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,979
We dealt with that last year as we studied through the book of 1 John.

50
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,539
Anyone can stand up and say I love Jesus.

51
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,699
But does the evidence support that you love Jesus?

52
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,139
Because he said if you love me, keep my commandments.

53
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,179
His commandments are not grievous is what he says, and that's true if we love him.

54
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:48,960
But this morning I want you to understand that because we love God, we find that we

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,220
should have a love for this book because it's this book that reveals God to me.

56
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,160
We sang the song this morning, holy, holy, holy.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,300
How do you know that God is holy?

58
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,979
Because he tells us in his word.

59
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,419
Without his word, we wouldn't know that God is holy.

60
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,820
Wash me now, the song that Ms. Lorene sang, I mean really a prayer, and we looked at it

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,140
from Psalm 51 before she sang the prayer of the psalmist.

62
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,059
But I want you to consider this morning when we sing that song, wash me now.

63
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:29,940
What gives us the hope to even sing that song is but understanding that in his word, he

64
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,420
has told us that he is a God that is ready to pardon, a God that is ready to forgive,

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,980
a God that with him is forgiveness.

66
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,660
What a blessing to understand this morning, and I believe that the psalmist as he makes

67
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,700
this claim this morning, oh how love I thy law.

68
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,380
Why does he love the word of God?

69
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,980
He loves the word of God because the word of God reveals God.

70
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,619
I know God through his word.

71
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:03,059
Someone said this years ago, to know God is to know his word.

72
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,459
There are people that know about God, there are people that try to define who God is.

73
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,059
We live in a culture and a society today in which there are many people that are trying

74
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:20,019
to define who God is and try to explain, whether they be politicians or some level of athletes

75
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:25,100
or maybe some actors and what have you, and they try to define who God is.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm sorry, but God's already defined who he is in his word, and unless you're reading

77
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:37,220
his word and giving his word with regard to who he is, your opinion doesn't matter, amen?

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,500
Because God has told us who he is, and he's told us how we approach him.

79
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,899
He's a holy God, holy, holy, holy.

80
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:54,899
Think about Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter 6, when he sees God in all of his holiness, it is

81
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,540
broken, it is broken.

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,459
This morning, as we look at this 119th psalm, and we'll look at a number of verses, if you're

83
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,299
taking notes, I want you to notice with me number one this morning, and really there's

84
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:14,420
only one number one, there's no other points this morning, there's a bunch of sub-points.

85
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,700
Because part two will be next week.

86
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,420
But number one this morning, the psalmist expresses his love for God's word.

87
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,019
We see it in verse number 97, I believe, and it ends with an exclamation mark there, that

88
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,660
first statement in verse number 97, I believe that the psalmist, as he expresses his love

89
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:39,500
for God's word, he's declaring this with loud voice, with excitement, oh, how love I thy

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
law.

91
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,820
Begin to think about this declaration here, and the psalmist expressing his love for God's

92
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,820
word.

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,299
I want you to see that it's not just in verse number 97.

94
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:53,579
Notice with me in verse number 127, we're going to notice a few verses here where the

95
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,899
psalmist makes this comment or this expression of his love for God's word.

96
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:08,739
In verse 127, the Bible says this, therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above

97
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,940
fine gold.

98
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,700
Now that's a great verse of Scripture.

99
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,980
There are a lot of people today that love gold.

100
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,260
A lot of people that love fine gold, right?

101
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,700
The Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil, and I think I mentioned

102
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
this before.

103
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,380
I was over at a pizza shop several years ago, and they had a tip jar.

104
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,459
By the way, you recognize today that everyone's looking for tips?

105
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,459
It's kind of interesting.

106
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,019
It never used to be that way, but all of this technology now, before you can sign for something,

107
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,820
it wants you to pick a tip, you know?

108
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,760
And it makes you feel bad if you don't pick what's there.

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,779
They just automatically populate it for you.

110
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:44,779
That's just a side note.

111
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,019
But in any case, they had a tip jar.

112
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:54,420
And on the tip jar, it said this, money is the root of all evil, therefore, leave us

113
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,940
a tip.

114
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,619
I promise you, that's what it said.

115
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:03,859
And I stood there, and my pizza wasn't ready yet, and I stood there, and I just pondered

116
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,380
that thing.

117
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,440
And I thought, what in the world am I going to say about this?

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,260
Because this is just, I've got to say something.

119
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,100
They gave me my pizza, and I said, hey, just so you know, the Bible actually says the love

120
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,299
of money is the root of all evil.

121
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,459
It doesn't say that money is the root of all evil, it says the love of money.

122
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,500
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says here.

123
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,260
He says, I love, therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.

124
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,659
There are people today that put great value and great treasure in gold, in things, in

125
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,419
possessions, but we find that the psalmist, understanding the value of God's Word, he

126
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,700
says that I love thy commandments above gold.

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,859
Take my gold, but give me my Bible, amen?

128
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,820
Notice what he says in verse 162.

129
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,859
Connect it here with understanding the value, why as the psalmist is expressing his love,

130
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:01,859
he's understanding the value of God's Word, thus he's saying I love it.

131
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:08,219
Notice, I just absolutely love the imagery that God gives us in verse 162 of the psalmist

132
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:09,219
and his love.

133
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:14,900
I rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil.

134
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,979
You think about somebody that finds great treasure.

135
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:22,900
Man, they rejoice, I mean, they're excited about that treasure that they found, that

136
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,900
great spoil that they found, that they had the opportunity to come and good fortunes

137
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:35,460
and so on and so forth, and here we find that the psalmist says that's how I rejoice at

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
thy word.

139
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,900
I wonder this morning, as you read your Bible this morning, as you read your Bible this

140
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,820
week, do you approach it that way?

141
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,419
That you're rejoicing in the same manner in which someone that would find great spoil

142
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,820
would rejoice?

143
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,979
Oh, when I read God's Word, I thank Him each day, thank you for giving me thy word.

144
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,499
Thank you for allowing me to have a copy of your Word

145
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:05,419
so that I can learn from it.

146
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,339
This is a valued possession.

147
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,639
My children knew as they were younger.

148
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,499
In fact, I still don't really let them carry my Bible.

149
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,539
When they were little kids, man,

150
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,819
they were not carrying my Bible.

151
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,739
You say, pastor, that's just silly.

152
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,739
There was just something about my Bible.

153
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,099
I didn't want them to drop it in a mud puddle or something.

154
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,179
It's my Bible.

155
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,819
I remember a preacher, a missionary,

156
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,299
he was actually here, and he was here a week after.

157
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,899
He was at another meeting.

158
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,739
I think, Brother Mark,

159
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:37,859
you and I were talking to him about this.

160
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,579
I don't know if you might remember this,

161
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,119
but he stuck his Bible on top of his car

162
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,959
before he left that church.

163
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,299
And he drove off without remembering

164
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,839
that he had set his Bible on the top of his car.

165
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,419
He was disappointed.

166
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,059
He went back, and he looked, and he looked,

167
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,019
and he looked, and he looked,

168
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,339
and he never could find his Bible.

169
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,579
And I just, I mean, you're supposed to rejoice.

170
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,939
This is the day the Lord hath made.

171
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,779
We will rejoice and be glad in it,

172
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,219
but man, it'd be hard for me.

173
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,299
I'm being honest.

174
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,099
He said, well, can't you just get another Bible?

175
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,099
Can, but man, if you read the Bible,

176
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,339
that's why I don't like reading the Bible on a screen.

177
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,239
If you read a Bible on a phone, on an iPad,

178
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,139
that's between you and the Lord.

179
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,099
I'm not saying that it's wrong.

180
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,579
I'm not saying that.

181
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,359
But there's something about holding the Bible,

182
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:34,119
something about being able to write in the Bible,

183
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,779
underline something, circle something.

184
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,359
Man, it's precious.

185
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,059
Here's what Job said.

186
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,899
He said this in Job 23, in verse number 12.

187
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,299
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips.

188
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,779
I have esteemed the words of his mouth

189
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,559
more than my necessary food.

190
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,379
That word esteem means to treasure.

191
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,379
It means to set a high value on.

192
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,939
And you notice the value that he placed on it

193
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:04,259
because he says I have esteemed the words of his mouth

194
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,819
more than my necessary food.

195
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,019
In just a little while, most of us anyway

196
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,099
are gonna go eat something.

197
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,579
In a little while, somebody's stomach's gonna be reminding

198
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,379
you that you're ready for lunch.

199
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:21,599
And we find here that Job says I have esteemed thy words

200
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,079
more than my necessary food.

201
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,639
He's put this value on it.

202
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,479
Notice back in Psalm 119, notice in verse number 140.

203
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,919
He says this, and we dealt with this a few weeks ago

204
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,319
about the fact that God's word is pure.

205
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,599
Notice he says in Psalm 119, in verse 140,

206
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:42,599
thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.

207
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:48,379
He's expressing his love for God's word.

208
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:53,379
In Psalm 119, verse 167, notice what he says.

209
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,039
My soul hath kept thy testimonies, and I love them how?

210
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,379
I love them exceedingly, exceedingly.

211
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,899
When you know the psalmist expressing his love

212
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,759
for God's word, I would ask a series of questions

213
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,659
this morning.

214
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,319
Number one, I would ask this, why did the psalmist

215
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,819
have such love for the word of God?

216
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:21,819
What was it, what is it that would cause you and I,

217
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:27,359
would cause the psalmist to say, oh, how love I thy law.

218
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,799
What is it about the Bible that should cause us,

219
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,999
we ask why did the psalmist have such love

220
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,239
for the word of God, but I would ask us this morning,

221
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:39,079
what is it about this book, the Bible, that should cause us

222
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,059
to echo the words of the psalmist?

223
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,019
Should we?

224
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,259
Absolutely.

225
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,459
We should say, oh, how love I thy law,

226
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,379
it is my meditation all the day, and we should echo

227
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,939
the words of the psalmist, but I would then ask

228
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,979
this question, it seems to me, and I'm not speaking

229
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,419
within just the group that's gathered this morning,

230
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,039
I'm talking about broadly speaking within Christendom

231
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,739
this morning, I wonder why it's such a rare thing today

232
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,759
to hear people say, to express their love for God's word.

233
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,359
You say, is it really that rare?

234
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,519
Well, as you drive around, even in our community,

235
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,559
and you see, you don't even have to go in

236
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,199
and talk to anyone, you can just see the evidence

237
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,539
that points to the fact that they do not love God's word.

238
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,119
What do you mean by that?

239
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,399
Just read some signs.

240
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,679
They're sending a message, and the message

241
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,279
that they're sending is a message that they have

242
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,659
no regard for this book, because the behavior

243
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,659
that they're following is a behavior that's not consistent

244
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,339
with the teaching of this book.

245
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,779
I was in the store the other day, I don't know

246
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,299
if any of you have these, you know, they want you

247
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,019
to give your phone number to, you know,

248
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,059
you're a valued customer at whatever place,

249
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,579
blah, blah, blah, they're gonna give you a discount.

250
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:57,299
I use Holly's number for all that stuff.

251
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,699
Glory, hallelujah.

252
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,259
And so, I gave, I was at some place,

253
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,259
and they said, do you have a number for the whatever,

254
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,319
and I gave them Holly's number, and they said, Holly?

255
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,559
I said, it's my wife.

256
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,079
And they said this, they said, well, you know,

257
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,119
these days, you just can't tell anymore.

258
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,899
I was like, let me set this record straight right now.

259
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:24,999
Holly is my wife, amen, and there is truth.

260
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,799
That's what I told them, there's truth.

261
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,059
We live in a world today where they seem like they,

262
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,359
well, you know, I gotta be careful.

263
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,079
If I say something, I could lose my job.

264
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,859
That's the pressure that people are feeling today.

265
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,759
And we find that there are churches,

266
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,919
within, broadly speaking, Christendom,

267
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,499
that obviously do not have a love for God's word,

268
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,379
because if they had a love for God's word,

269
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,879
they would obey it, they would preach it,

270
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
they would live it, correct?

271
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:58,659
Amen.

272
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,939
If we love the Bible, like the psalmist,

273
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,999
there will be evidence in our lives,

274
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,579
just like there's evidence within Psalm 119.

275
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,619
Next week, we're gonna look at 10 evidences from Psalm 119,

276
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,899
and there's more than that, but we're gonna look at 10,

277
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,939
as to how, so you get one point today, 10 next week, amen,

278
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,499
and we'll make up for it.

279
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:22,019
But the reality is that there are 10 evidences,

280
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,299
at least 10 evidences in Psalm 119,

281
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,999
that give us the support necessary to say

282
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,239
that the psalmist absolutely, as he made this claim,

283
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:38,959
it's not unfounded, no, it's very much sure.

284
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,719
What led to this expression?

285
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,739
He said, oh, how love I thy law.

286
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,739
Notice with me, again, a number of verses

287
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,599
within this great chapter of God's word.

288
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,439
I would say what led to this expression,

289
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:53,919
number one, the Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

290
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,179
The Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

291
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,099
Notice in verse number 98 of this psalm,

292
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,539
the Bible says this, right after, he says,

293
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,019
oh, how love I thy law, it is my meditation all the day.

294
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:10,019
Thou, through thy commandments, has made me wiser

295
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:14,299
than mine enemies, for they are ever with me.

296
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,319
I have more understanding than all my teachers,

297
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,299
for thy testimonies are my meditation.

298
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,059
That's now every young person's life verse.

299
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,719
Verse 100, I understand more than the ancients,

300
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,639
because I keep thy precepts.

301
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:33,639
You know, God's word gives wisdom and understanding.

302
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,039
Verse 104, through thy precepts, I get understanding,

303
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:42,219
therefore, I hate every false way.

304
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:44,199
Verse number 130, the Bible says,

305
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,859
the entrance of thy words giveth light,

306
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,639
giveth understanding unto the simple.

307
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,959
And in verse 169, the psalmist says,

308
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,919
let my cry come near before thee, O Lord.

309
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,919
Give me understanding according to thy word.

310
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,839
Listen, this morning, we need wisdom.

311
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,259
We need understanding.

312
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:11,999
We find that God's word, the Bible,

313
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,239
gives us wisdom and gives us understanding.

314
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,039
And I'm so thankful for that.

315
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:19,339
The Bible not only gives wisdom and understanding,

316
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,579
the Bible gives direction.

317
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,499
How many times in our lives we are praying for direction,

318
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,659
we're seeking that God would provide us with clarity,

319
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,739
with direction regarding our path, regarding our lives,

320
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:34,219
what are the next steps, and so on and so forth.

321
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:37,099
And we find that God will lead us.

322
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,940
Many times we look at the Old Testament,

323
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,019
we're aware of the truth that God led the children of Israel

324
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,619
a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,

325
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,519
and we think about the way in which God led his people,

326
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,459
and as you study through the Exodus

327
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,760
and look at God's leadership for his people,

328
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,079
and you see how specific God was in leading them

329
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,820
to the place where he led them

330
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,979
for the purpose that he had for them,

331
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:04,839
and God still leads us today.

332
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,320
I don't have a pillar of cloud or a pillar of fire,

333
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,919
but I have the Holy Spirit of God that lives within me

334
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,959
that will guide me into all truth,

335
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,279
and I have the whole canon of Scripture.

336
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,399
You know, in the book of Exodus,

337
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,059
they didn't have the whole Bible.

338
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,139
They needed that pillar of cloud by day

339
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,000
and that pillar of fire by night,

340
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,459
but now today we have the whole Bible,

341
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:27,699
and the psalmist says this in verse 105,

342
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:32,699
thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

343
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,859
It's a familiar verse of Scripture,

344
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,899
but oh, how we understand that as the psalmist

345
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,339
would make this expression,

346
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,139
and we asked the question this morning,

347
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,119
what led to this expression?

348
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,179
Why did the psalmist say, oh, how love I thy law?

349
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,219
Well, it gives wisdom and understanding.

350
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:53,619
It gives direction.

351
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:55,059
I would say this.

352
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,619
The Bible defines right and wrong.

353
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:00,260
Thy word.

354
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,220
Word is truth.

355
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:15,700
We live in a society in which they want to remove morals.

356
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,340
They desire to legislate wickedness.

357
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,060
Not desire, they are.

358
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,620
It's no longer just a desire.

359
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,940
It's what they do.

360
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,940
They find that God's Word defines right and wrong.

361
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,380
And listen, it's not for you, it's not for me, it's not for us to have some level of

362
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,540
subjectivity with regard to right and wrong, evil and good.

363
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,500
No, God's Word is the authority.

364
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,060
And I love God's Word because God's Word tells me what's right and what's wrong.

365
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,620
When you live in a culture that's ever-changing, when you live in a people that are departing

366
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,100
from any level of morality, we go back to the standard and we say, no, God's Word defines

367
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,300
what's right and wrong.

368
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,900
And I'm thankful for that.

369
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,380
And it causes me to love God's Word.

370
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,880
Listen, God never changes.

371
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,060
People change.

372
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,860
But as I tether myself and my morals to God's Word that is unchanging forever, O Lord, thy

373
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Word is settled in heaven, then I can define morals, I can define right and wrong regardless

374
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,940
of the year.

375
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,980
Regardless of how many calendar flips there are, we can define right and wrong.

376
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,220
Notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 119.

377
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,820
We read already verse 104, but the end of that verse says this, it says, through thy

378
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:51,140
precepts I get understanding, therefore I hate every false way.

379
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,820
The Bible exposes those false ways.

380
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:01,540
Verse 113, he says this, I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.

381
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:08,820
In verse 128, therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate

382
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,580
every false way.

383
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,140
Hey, what's right here?

384
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,140
What's wrong here?

385
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,860
Let's see what God's Word says, because God is the author.

386
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,980
I said this as we studied through Psalm 37, the Bible says in Psalm 37, as the instruction

387
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,840
is given to the believers, trust in the Lord, in verse number 3, and do good.

388
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,700
We ask this question, what does it mean to do good?

389
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
Good master?

390
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,900
Not one thing.

391
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,780
Why callest thou me good?

392
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Who's good?

393
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,780
God is good.

394
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
That's what he tells them.

395
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,380
And so the good God that we serve is the God who defines what is good.

396
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,340
He defines what is good.

397
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,420
And this morning when we begin to understand this portion of Scripture of Psalm 119, and

398
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,700
understanding this expression that the psalmist gives, we've looked at for these last several

399
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,000
weeks now the inspiration of God's Word, the preservation of God's Word, the sufficiency

400
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,540
in the fact that God's Word is superior, and we look at those things and now we come to

401
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:22,260
the place that say, I love God's Word because I understand what it is, and I understand

402
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,620
what it does.

403
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,940
It gives understanding, it gives wisdom, it gives direction.

404
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,220
It defines what's right and what's wrong.

405
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,980
It reveals to me who God is.

406
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,380
To know God is to know His Word.

407
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,140
I said that by way of introduction.

408
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:51,580
But apart from this book, you can think of the most anti-God society or culture or whatever

409
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,500
this morning, and you can think of a people that are idol worshipers and so on and so

410
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,380
forth, and you can say, listen, we'd be in the same place if we didn't have a Bible that

411
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,620
revealed to us who God is.

412
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,020
The story of a missionary that went to a remote area in Asia many, many years ago, decades

413
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:22,440
ago, and he found as he arrived to that place that the people welcomed him.

414
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,220
There was some opposition leading up to the journey of all that would take place because

415
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:35,779
of the testimony, if you will, the reputation of that particular people group.

416
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,260
The missionary arrives and finds out that they're welcoming, and there's different reception

417
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,300
than what he anticipated, and he soon finds as he interacts with those of that particular

418
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,619
people group that there'd been someone that had come there and brought a Bible before

419
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,779
that person had arrived.

420
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,100
They trusted Christ as their Savior, and he found that there are many believers within

421
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
the village.

422
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,980
It was exciting because the chief of that particular place, as he spoke with that missionary,

423
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,279
he said, you know, it's a really good thing that this happened, that we received the Bible,

424
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:20,700
because had we not, we would have killed you and eaten you, because that's what we did.

425
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,860
The Bible made the difference.

426
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,779
God's Word changed their lives.

427
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:31,300
See, this morning, God reveals Himself to us through His Word.

428
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,140
I want you to consider very quickly this morning as we conclude, I want you to consider how

429
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,619
the Holy Spirit will use His Word.

430
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,520
How does He use the Bible in our lives today?

431
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,059
We see the expression of the psalmist, and we know how the psalmist expresses his love

432
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:54,580
for God's Word, and some reasons within Psalm 119 as to why he would make that declaration.

433
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,500
But this morning, I want you to consider just a few thoughts with regard to how God will

434
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,779
use His Word in your life and in my life today.

435
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,100
Number one, the Bible will convict you.

436
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,500
The Bible will convict you.

437
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,140
By the way, conviction's a good thing.

438
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
It's a good thing to be convicted.

439
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,420
Turn to the book of Acts, if you will, in Acts chapter number 24.

440
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:24,160
In Acts chapter number 24, Paul is giving his testimony here, his defense before Felix.

441
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,700
Sometimes people have the wrong idea.

442
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,420
They think that conviction is a bad thing.

443
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,260
I'm thankful that God, the Holy Spirit, will use His Word to convict us.

444
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,300
You know, there are times in which we need our toes stepped on.

445
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Amen?

446
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,339
By the way, it's a gracious thing that God would convict us.

447
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,140
It's gracious of God.

448
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,760
As Paul was giving his defense before Felix, the Bible says in verse 24, and after certain

449
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,100
days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard

450
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,540
him concerning the faith in Christ.

451
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,580
And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.

452
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,779
Now, that's pretty interesting that the Bible speaks of that right there in verse 25 as

453
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,660
to what Paul's message was, because in John, the Bible says that when the Holy Spirit

454
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,180
comes, He's going to reprove the world of what?

455
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,800
Of sin, righteousness, and judgment to come.

456
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,020
And here the Bible says that Paul was preaching his reasoning of righteousness, temperance,

457
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,059
and judgment to come.

458
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,660
Notice what the Bible says, Felix trembled.

459
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,940
He trembled.

460
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Why?

461
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,820
Because God's Word will convict you.

462
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,540
He trembled and answered, go thy way for this time.

463
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,460
When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

464
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,140
You know, we have conviction in our life.

465
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,420
There's really two responses.

466
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,619
One is what Felix does.

467
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:45,619
I'm done with this.

468
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:46,619
Get out of here.

469
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,220
I don't want to hear any more because I don't like the conviction.

470
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,000
Or we can surrender.

471
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,619
God convicts me and I change.

472
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,619
I respond.

473
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,820
There are people that have given testimonies.

474
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,059
My dad would share the testimony, a missionary, I think Brother Haley was here and shared

475
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,860
the testimony of someone grabbing the back of a pew, actually it was Brother Dan Hummel

476
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,980
on Sunday night a couple of weeks ago, and their knuckles turning white under so much

477
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,580
conviction and just refusing to go forward and submit to the conviction.

478
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,500
There are times in which people will leave, as Felix does, just they don't want to hear

479
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
it.

480
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,339
But I'm thankful that the Bible will convict us.

481
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,260
Listen, by the way, as God's people, we need conviction in our life.

482
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,619
There are times in which God needs to use His Word.

483
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:35,859
Listen, as I pray, as I read God's Word, God, would you show me, expose to me areas

484
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,660
in my life where I need to change, where it convicts me?

485
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,900
It's a good thing.

486
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,460
The Bible will convert you.

487
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,419
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Peter, we looked at this verse a few weeks ago.

488
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:53,419
In 1 Peter chapter number 1, I read this verse of scripture after the song was sang, the

489
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:55,460
special music, and we started here.

490
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,020
We were going to be in Psalm 12 to begin, but we started here in 1 Peter 1 on that particular

491
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,739
Sunday morning, and verse number 23 says, being born again, aren't you thankful to be

492
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:04,739
saved?

493
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,859
What does it mean to be born again?

494
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:11,619
They use the term today, again, I've mentioned this before, that there are many false teachers,

495
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:16,260
and here's what false teachers do, they'll use our terms, but they use a different definition.

496
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I've been born again.

497
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
What does it mean to be born again?

498
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Well, I was baptized.

499
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,780
That's not what it means to be born again.

500
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,340
Nope.

501
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Is that right?

502
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Biblically speaking, baptism does not equal being born again.

503
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,940
Now, if you're born again, you ought to be baptized.

504
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,619
First step of obedience, amen?

505
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,140
If you're born again, you ought to be scripturally baptized.

506
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,380
But being baptized does not mean that you're born again.

507
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,500
Remember what Jesus said to Nicodemus, marvel not that I said unto thee that ye must be

508
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,340
born again.

509
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,419
Praise the Lord.

510
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,140
The second birth, glory, hallelujah, when you trust the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal

511
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,299
Savior, understanding that you're a sinner and that He's the only one that can save you.

512
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,539
only Savior, and you can't get to heaven on your own. I talked to a man just on Friday,

513
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:08,819
the same guy that I gave Holly's number to, and I said this, I said, listen, do you go

514
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:12,059
to church anywhere? He said, man, and he kind of gave me an answer, and I said, let me ask

515
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,739
you this, are you 100% sure if you were to die today you'd go to heaven? Right at the

516
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:21,499
checkout line, no one else was in line, so I was able to ask him. He said, you know,

517
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:26,939
I can't say I'm 100% sure, but I'm okay with whatever because I know I've sinned. That's

518
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:32,459
what he said. That's what he said to me. And I said this, I said, you know, I just

519
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:39,539
use my credit card to pay for that transaction. I said, the reality is that no one at the

520
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,779
credit card company really cares who pays the credit card bill. I made the transaction,

521
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:54,739
so I'm responsible for it, but if my dad wants to pay for it, he can. Right? The credit card

522
00:30:54,739 --> 00:31:00,619
company doesn't care, as long as it gets paid. Here's what I said, you've done some

523
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:06,579
things wrong. You just admitted that, that you're a sinner, but Jesus paid for it. Jesus

524
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:13,979
paid for it, and that satisfies the Father, and that's a glorious truth of God's Word,

525
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:20,059
the substitutionary atonement. And listen, God's Word, he says, being born again, not

526
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:24,579
of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth

527
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:29,579
forever. Hallelujah for salvation. Listen, the Bible will convict you, it'll convert

528
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,579
you. Number three, the Bible will correct you. You ever have a time that you're wrong

529
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:38,819
in your thinking? Sure there are. Times that we're wrong in our thinking, and we need our

530
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:45,379
thinking to be corrected. We have a wrong perspective, a wrong view, and we find that

531
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:50,699
God's Word will correct us. In 2 Timothy 3, we've read this verse, all Scripture, in verse

532
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:54,939
16, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for

533
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:59,459
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be

534
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:05,459
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. This morning, there are times in which

535
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:09,459
we need correction. Don't worry about somebody else that needs correction. Recognize that

536
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:13,899
there are times in your life that you need correction. You know what happens sometimes?

537
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:22,899
You don't like being corrected. Most people don't like being corrected. You know why?

538
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:30,019
Pride. Pride. Because in order to be corrected means I have to acknowledge I was wrong. Most

539
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:39,779
people don't like to acknowledge when they're wrong. Yeah, that was my dad, real loud. Have

540
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:46,019
you been wrong yet this year? Yeah, probably not. It's only March. Lying in church. You

541
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:54,739
better move, Mom. Pierre, you might want to back up too, amen? But understand that we

542
00:32:54,739 --> 00:33:02,819
need correction. We need correction. God's Word corrects. Let me say this. This is precious.

543
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:11,499
God's Word comforts. I want you to think about this. This book, it's a living book.

544
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:16,939
And this book, all in the same session of reading it, if you want to call it that, and

545
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:21,659
time with the Lord, hearing preaching of God's Word, whatever it might be, that this book

546
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:29,419
can convict you and comfort you at the same time. It's amazing. Notice what the Bible

547
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:36,179
says in 1 Thessalonians. Look at what the Bible says. In 1 Thessalonians, these believers

548
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,939
of Thessalonica, there's confusion with regard to some things with regard to the coming of

549
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:43,699
the Lord and so on and so forth, and we find there's even more confusion as you look at

550
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:48,099
the second letter that's written, and Paul is giving them instruction, and we find that

551
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:53,179
it's a precious passage of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 4, beginning in verse 13, and

552
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:57,379
going through the end of the passage, and we find that Paul says, I would, notice how

553
00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:03,779
he begins in verse 13, but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them

554
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:08,699
which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. And we find

555
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:14,819
that Paul is desiring that these believers in Thessalonica, and of course it's been preserved

556
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:20,319
for us this morning, that we would have, that we would be informed with regard to these

557
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:25,940
things, and we find that he's speaking the Word of the Lord. He says that in verse number

558
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,299
15, for this we say unto you, by the Word of the Lord. It's not Paul just giving a pep

559
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:37,859
talk in his idea, his thoughts. No, he's giving the Scripture, and he's giving the Word of

560
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:42,299
the Lord, and he ends the passage of Scripture. I don't know how many times I've read this

561
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:46,899
portion of Scripture, and I've been encouraged with 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 18, where

562
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:56,139
the Bible says, wherefore, comfort one another with what? With these words, these words.

563
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:00,500
See, God is the God of all comfort. You read 2 Corinthians chapter number 1, and you find

564
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,819
that to be declared for us. He is the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all of

565
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:09,299
our infirmities. Every problem we have, God is the Comforter. Listen, the Holy Spirit

566
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:15,059
of God, one of His divine names that's described to Him is the Comforter. But you know God

567
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:22,019
uses His Word to comfort us. How many times we've had troubled hearts? Maybe as the disciples

568
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,659
had troubled hearts in John 14, after they heard all that Jesus had shared with them

569
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:34,699
in chapter 13 about the cross, and Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled. Why does He

570
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,339
make that statement? Because He knows that their heart's troubled, and He's going to

571
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:43,299
comfort them. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me. And

572
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:47,099
then He gives them that wonderful promise that I will come again and receive you unto

573
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,619
Myself. You look at that passage in John 14, verses 1 through 3, how powerful that is.

574
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:57,139
In a group of men, these disciples that had hearts that were troubled are now able to

575
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:03,239
be comforted through the words of Jesus. You ever been in a situation where someone has

576
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,699
said to you, thank you for those words, they were a comfort. No doubt somebody said that

577
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,459
to you at some point in your life. Have you ever been in a place where you've been interacting

578
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:15,739
with somebody that's having a difficulty and you feel like you don't know what to say?

579
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:22,379
You ever been in that position? I just don't know what to say here. A loss of a loved one

580
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:27,459
or some other tragic situation, and we might be in that place where we feel like, listen,

581
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:33,819
speak God's Word, because God's Word gives comfort. Almost every funeral I've ever preached,

582
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:40,579
at some point I'm visiting 1 Thessalonians 4. Why? Because we sorrow not as others which

583
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:47,779
have no hope. And he says, wherefore comfort one another with these words. It's amazing

584
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:53,579
how God's Word comforts the heart of His people. The Bible will convict you, convert you, comfort

585
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:59,859
or correct you, comfort you. Finally, this morning, the Bible should change you. The

586
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:06,659
Bible should change you. The Bible tells us in James 1 and verse 22 that we're to be doers

587
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:13,539
of the Word and not hearers only. Of course, we're familiar with the song that we sing

588
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:18,500
with the children that's a result of the teaching of Christ about the wise man and the foolish

589
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:27,220
man. And we speak about that, or we sing that song and we speak about that portion of Scripture.

590
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:34,979
We find that in both situations they heard the teaching of Jesus, but one was obedient

591
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:42,859
and one was disobedient. One did and one did not. And this morning we think about the

592
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:48,139
Bible changing us. I wonder this morning, if you look at your life, if you look at your

593
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:55,539
Christian life, how much has God's Word changed you? How much has God's Word changed you?

594
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:03,859
You remember the maniac at Gadara? Jesus came, the living Word, and He spoke the Word of

595
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:11,220
God to him. And that maniac at Gadara was transformed. Why? Well, because the Bible

596
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:19,899
convicts, converts. No doubt it corrected. There was some comfort, understanding that

597
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:24,979
Jesus is the Savior. There was a change. Those people came back and they found that this

598
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:32,979
man who was demon-possessed is now clothed in his right mind and he's sitting at the

599
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:38,459
feet of Jesus. There was a change in that man's life. What do you think about Paul?

600
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:46,339
His name was Saul before he was converted. In Acts 9, he's traveling the road to Damascus.

601
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:49,859
He's traveling not alone, there's other people with him, but he sees this light and he hears

602
00:38:49,859 --> 00:39:04,419
the Lord. Who art thou, Lord? I am Jesus. Can you imagine? Saul says, what wilt thou

603
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:11,820
have me to do? If you read Acts chapter 9 and you skip the middle portion of that passage

604
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,700
of Scripture, you will be confused beyond confused. Because Acts 9 begins with him

605
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:26,799
going to slaughter, going to arrest. And then you get to Acts 9 and verse 20 and the Bible

606
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:34,779
says in a straight way, he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

607
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:42,459
Saul, what happened? Jesus stepped in, changed his life. Would you acknowledge this morning

608
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:48,459
that Saul was never the same after this experience in Acts chapter 9? And I wonder this morning,

609
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:55,380
has God's Word changed you? Can you look in your life and can you see how God's Word has

610
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,380
changed you? I hope you can. And I hope that it continues.

611
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,340
continues to change us because we are to be conformed to the image of His dear Son, to

612
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,860
be like Christ.

613
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,700
And every day of our lives, we need to have this book a part of our lives.

614
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Why?

615
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Because it will convict.

616
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,420
I hope that you've been converted.

617
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:28,460
It'll correct, comfort, and change us, oh, that we would be more like Christ.

618
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:35,940
This morning, the psalmist declares, oh, how love I thy law.

619
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
What made him say that?

620
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,860
Well, he understood that the Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

621
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,300
He understood that the Bible gives direction.

622
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,460
He understands that the Bible defines right and wrong.

623
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:54,620
He understood that the Bible reveals who God is, thus declaring, expressing His love for

624
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,620
this book.

625
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,180
He didn't even have all that we have.

626
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:06,300
Oh, this morning, I believe that we ought to echo the words of the psalmist.

627
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,880
As we'll mention, as I've already mentioned and we'll look at next week, if we echo those

628
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,300
words, is there evidence that will support our claim?

629
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:22,900
Is there evidence in your life, is there evidence in my life that would support the claim that

630
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,760
I love this book?

631
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:34,380
Look at 10 things next week from Psalm 119 that reveal to us overwhelming evidence that

632
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,020
supports the claim of the psalmist, oh, how love I thy law.

633
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,780
This morning, I hope you'll just thank God for His Word.

634
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Let's pray.

635
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
Father, we love You.

636
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,940
We thank You for loving us.

637
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,220
We thank You for the Bible.

638
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:00,420
We could not, we would not be here this morning if it wasn't for Your Word.

639
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,420
We could not sing the songs that we sang.

640
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:12,860
We could not rejoice in the things that we rejoiced in had we not had Your Word.

641
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:20,820
But I thank You for the expression of the psalmist, expresses his love for Your Word.

642
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:30,660
As we've sought to walk through the 119th Psalm to analyze why he would make that declaration,

643
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:37,740
I trust that this morning, each of us would echo the words of the psalmist, say, oh, how

644
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,740
love I thy law.

645
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,620
God, I pray that You'd help us.

646
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,820
Thank You as we should for this book.

647
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,540
Help us to never neglect it, set it aside.

648
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,620
Lord, I pray that You'd help us daily to get into Your Word so that Your Word would get

649
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,580
into our lives and change us.

650
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,460
Help us to be submitted to Thy Word.

651
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,059
I pray, Father, that as we rejoice and thank You for giving us Your Word that we'd be careful

652
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:14,860
to share the truth of Your Word with those that we come into contact with, knowing that

653
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,020
just as it's benefited us, it'll benefit them.

654
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,220
Just as it's changed us, it'll change them.

655
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,180
I pray that You'd help us to be faithful.

656
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,460
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray that this morning, You would convict

657
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,820
them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment to come.

658
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,620
Before they leave this place or log off of livestream, they would trust Christ as their

659
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,419
personal Savior.

660
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,740
Help us, Lord, now to respond as we should, and we'll thank You for it.

661
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,180
Would you stand with me?
