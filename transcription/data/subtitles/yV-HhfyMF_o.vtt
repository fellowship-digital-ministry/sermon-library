00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.139
this morning, Psalm 119 this morning, as we continue with our series here on Sunday mornings,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.140
Great is the Lord.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.640
And I'm thankful for God's greatness.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.520
I'm thankful that we could stand and say, I know that the Lord is great.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.899
And at the very same time, we can say that his greatness is unsearchable because every

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:25.200
day that we walk with the Lord, we just find out how much greater he is than we thought

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.500
the day before.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
He is great.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.599
And I've said this often over the years, but today in your mind, you have God at a certain

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.639
place, elevate it high, holy and lifted up.

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:41.119
And you say God is great, but he's greater than what you can even imagine.

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:46.720
And it is such a wonderful thing to understand the greatness of God.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.439
We understand as we come to this portion of scripture over the last couple of weeks, we

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:56.279
have noted that God's greatness is revealed to us through the inspiration of his word

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:58.860
and the preservation of his word.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.580
And as we've studied those passages that led us last week to deal with the fact that because

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.779
all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and because God who is eternal promised to

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:17.540
preserve his word from just this generation and forever, that God's word is sufficient

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.540
and it is superior.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.180
And I am so thankful for those Bible truths.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.860
And this morning, as we look at this declaration of the psalmist, we find that the psalmist

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.500
then is going to declare in Psalm 119, a familiar verse of scripture in verse number 97,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.940
O how love I thy law!

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.559
It thy law is my meditation all the day.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.059
Over the next two weeks, today and next week, you see that it's a part one message.

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:47.379
Next week will be part two.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:51.980
We're going to discuss this portion of scripture, Psalm 119, looking at a variety of verses

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.019
of scripture.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:02:00.580
But what I want to know is how the psalmist expresses his love for God's word.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.379
But then next week, that's what we're going to deal with this morning.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:08.259
Next week we're going to examine the evidence of this claim.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.460
You know, we can claim anything.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.979
But does the evidence support the claim?

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:21.539
I'll preach the message next week, but I will say this morning that absolutely the evidence

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.139
and the life of the psalmist supports the claim that he makes here in verse number 97,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.259
O how love I thy law!

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:37.100
I want you to understand that we recognize this morning that we love God and we understand

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.139
that the book of Deuteronomy tells us that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.139
thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:52.179
In fact, the psalmist declares in Psalm 31 and verse number 23, speaking of the saints

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:58.179
of God, it says this, O love the Lord, all ye his saints.

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:03.100
And then in Psalm 116 and verse number 1, the psalmist says this, I love the Lord because

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.259
he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:12.660
Of course, we're familiar with what John said in 1 John chapter number 4 and verse number

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.979
19 when he says that I love him, but we know that we love him, why?

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.740
Because he first loved us.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.940
And I'm so thankful this morning that we love God and we should love God, and by the way,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.460
there should be evidence of that claim as well.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.979
We dealt with that last year as we studied through the book of 1 John.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.539
Anyone can stand up and say I love Jesus.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.699
But does the evidence support that you love Jesus?

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.139
Because he said if you love me, keep my commandments.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.179
His commandments are not grievous is what he says, and that's true if we love him.

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.960
But this morning I want you to understand that because we love God, we find that we

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.220
should have a love for this book because it's this book that reveals God to me.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.160
We sang the song this morning, holy, holy, holy.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.300
How do you know that God is holy?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.979
Because he tells us in his word.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.419
Without his word, we wouldn't know that God is holy.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.820
Wash me now, the song that Ms. Lorene sang, I mean really a prayer, and we looked at it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.140
from Psalm 51 before she sang the prayer of the psalmist.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.059
But I want you to consider this morning when we sing that song, wash me now.

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:29.940
What gives us the hope to even sing that song is but understanding that in his word, he

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.420
has told us that he is a God that is ready to pardon, a God that is ready to forgive,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.980
a God that with him is forgiveness.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.660
What a blessing to understand this morning, and I believe that the psalmist as he makes

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.700
this claim this morning, oh how love I thy law.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.380
Why does he love the word of God?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.980
He loves the word of God because the word of God reveals God.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.619
I know God through his word.

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:03.059
Someone said this years ago, to know God is to know his word.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.459
There are people that know about God, there are people that try to define who God is.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.059
We live in a culture and a society today in which there are many people that are trying

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:20.019
to define who God is and try to explain, whether they be politicians or some level of athletes

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:25.100
or maybe some actors and what have you, and they try to define who God is.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.100
I'm sorry, but God's already defined who he is in his word, and unless you're reading

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:37.220
his word and giving his word with regard to who he is, your opinion doesn't matter, amen?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.500
Because God has told us who he is, and he's told us how we approach him.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.899
He's a holy God, holy, holy, holy.

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:54.899
Think about Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter 6, when he sees God in all of his holiness, it is

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.540
broken, it is broken.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.459
This morning, as we look at this 119th psalm, and we'll look at a number of verses, if you're

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.299
taking notes, I want you to notice with me number one this morning, and really there's

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:14.420
only one number one, there's no other points this morning, there's a bunch of sub-points.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.700
Because part two will be next week.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.420
But number one this morning, the psalmist expresses his love for God's word.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.019
We see it in verse number 97, I believe, and it ends with an exclamation mark there, that

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:31.660
first statement in verse number 97, I believe that the psalmist, as he expresses his love

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:39.500
for God's word, he's declaring this with loud voice, with excitement, oh, how love I thy

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.500
law.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.820
Begin to think about this declaration here, and the psalmist expressing his love for God's

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.820
word.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.299
I want you to see that it's not just in verse number 97.

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:53.579
Notice with me in verse number 127, we're going to notice a few verses here where the

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:59.899
psalmist makes this comment or this expression of his love for God's word.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:08.739
In verse 127, the Bible says this, therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:10.940
fine gold.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.700
Now that's a great verse of Scripture.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.980
There are a lot of people today that love gold.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.260
A lot of people that love fine gold, right?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.700
The Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil, and I think I mentioned

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.700
this before.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.380
I was over at a pizza shop several years ago, and they had a tip jar.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.459
By the way, you recognize today that everyone's looking for tips?

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:32.459
It's kind of interesting.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:37.019
It never used to be that way, but all of this technology now, before you can sign for something,

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:38.820
it wants you to pick a tip, you know?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.760
And it makes you feel bad if you don't pick what's there.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.779
They just automatically populate it for you.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:44.779
That's just a side note.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:48.019
But in any case, they had a tip jar.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:54.420
And on the tip jar, it said this, money is the root of all evil, therefore, leave us

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.940
a tip.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.619
I promise you, that's what it said.

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:03.859
And I stood there, and my pizza wasn't ready yet, and I stood there, and I just pondered

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.380
that thing.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.440
And I thought, what in the world am I going to say about this?

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.260
Because this is just, I've got to say something.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:17.100
They gave me my pizza, and I said, hey, just so you know, the Bible actually says the love

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.299
of money is the root of all evil.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.459
It doesn't say that money is the root of all evil, it says the love of money.

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:25.500
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says here.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.260
He says, I love, therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.659
There are people today that put great value and great treasure in gold, in things, in

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:41.419
possessions, but we find that the psalmist, understanding the value of God's Word, he

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.700
says that I love thy commandments above gold.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.859
Take my gold, but give me my Bible, amen?

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:52.820
Notice what he says in verse 162.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.859
Connect it here with understanding the value, why as the psalmist is expressing his love,

00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:01.859
he's understanding the value of God's Word, thus he's saying I love it.

00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:08.219
Notice, I just absolutely love the imagery that God gives us in verse 162 of the psalmist

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:09.219
and his love.

00:09:09.219 --> 00:09:14.900
I rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.979
You think about somebody that finds great treasure.

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:22.900
Man, they rejoice, I mean, they're excited about that treasure that they found, that

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.900
great spoil that they found, that they had the opportunity to come and good fortunes

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:35.460
and so on and so forth, and here we find that the psalmist says that's how I rejoice at

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.460
thy word.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.900
I wonder this morning, as you read your Bible this morning, as you read your Bible this

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.820
week, do you approach it that way?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:51.419
That you're rejoicing in the same manner in which someone that would find great spoil

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:52.820
would rejoice?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:59.979
Oh, when I read God's Word, I thank Him each day, thank you for giving me thy word.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:03.499
Thank you for allowing me to have a copy of your Word

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:05.419
so that I can learn from it.

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:08.339
This is a valued possession.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.639
My children knew as they were younger.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:16.499
In fact, I still don't really let them carry my Bible.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:17.539
When they were little kids, man,

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:18.819
they were not carrying my Bible.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.739
You say, pastor, that's just silly.

00:10:20.739 --> 00:10:22.739
There was just something about my Bible.

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:26.099
I didn't want them to drop it in a mud puddle or something.

00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.179
It's my Bible.

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.819
I remember a preacher, a missionary,

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:34.299
he was actually here, and he was here a week after.

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:35.899
He was at another meeting.

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:36.739
I think, Brother Mark,

00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:37.859
you and I were talking to him about this.

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:39.579
I don't know if you might remember this,

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.119
but he stuck his Bible on top of his car

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.959
before he left that church.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:49.299
And he drove off without remembering

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:51.839
that he had set his Bible on the top of his car.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.419
He was disappointed.

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:58.059
He went back, and he looked, and he looked,

00:10:58.059 --> 00:10:59.019
and he looked, and he looked,

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:01.339
and he never could find his Bible.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.579
And I just, I mean, you're supposed to rejoice.

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:06.939
This is the day the Lord hath made.

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:08.779
We will rejoice and be glad in it,

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:10.219
but man, it'd be hard for me.

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:11.299
I'm being honest.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:15.099
He said, well, can't you just get another Bible?

00:11:15.099 --> 00:11:18.099
Can, but man, if you read the Bible,

00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:21.339
that's why I don't like reading the Bible on a screen.

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:23.239
If you read a Bible on a phone, on an iPad,

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:24.139
that's between you and the Lord.

00:11:24.859 --> 00:11:26.099
I'm not saying that it's wrong.

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:27.579
I'm not saying that.

00:11:27.579 --> 00:11:30.359
But there's something about holding the Bible,

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:34.119
something about being able to write in the Bible,

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:36.779
underline something, circle something.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.359
Man, it's precious.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.059
Here's what Job said.

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:42.899
He said this in Job 23, in verse number 12.

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:45.299
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips.

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:48.779
I have esteemed the words of his mouth

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:51.559
more than my necessary food.

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:55.379
That word esteem means to treasure.

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:59.379
It means to set a high value on.

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:01.939
And you notice the value that he placed on it

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:04.259
because he says I have esteemed the words of his mouth

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:07.819
more than my necessary food.

00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:10.019
In just a little while, most of us anyway

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.099
are gonna go eat something.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.579
In a little while, somebody's stomach's gonna be reminding

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:16.379
you that you're ready for lunch.

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:21.599
And we find here that Job says I have esteemed thy words

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:24.079
more than my necessary food.

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:25.639
He's put this value on it.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:30.479
Notice back in Psalm 119, notice in verse number 140.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:32.919
He says this, and we dealt with this a few weeks ago

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.319
about the fact that God's word is pure.

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.599
Notice he says in Psalm 119, in verse 140,

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:42.599
thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:48.379
He's expressing his love for God's word.

00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:53.379
In Psalm 119, verse 167, notice what he says.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:58.039
My soul hath kept thy testimonies, and I love them how?

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:01.379
I love them exceedingly, exceedingly.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:05.899
When you know the psalmist expressing his love

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:09.759
for God's word, I would ask a series of questions

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.659
this morning.

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:13.319
Number one, I would ask this, why did the psalmist

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:16.819
have such love for the word of God?

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:21.819
What was it, what is it that would cause you and I,

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:27.359
would cause the psalmist to say, oh, how love I thy law.

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:30.799
What is it about the Bible that should cause us,

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:32.999
we ask why did the psalmist have such love

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.239
for the word of God, but I would ask us this morning,

00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:39.079
what is it about this book, the Bible, that should cause us

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:42.059
to echo the words of the psalmist?

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:43.019
Should we?

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:45.259
Absolutely.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:48.459
We should say, oh, how love I thy law,

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:51.379
it is my meditation all the day, and we should echo

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:53.939
the words of the psalmist, but I would then ask

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:56.979
this question, it seems to me, and I'm not speaking

00:13:56.979 --> 00:14:00.419
within just the group that's gathered this morning,

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:03.039
I'm talking about broadly speaking within Christendom

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:06.739
this morning, I wonder why it's such a rare thing today

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:11.759
to hear people say, to express their love for God's word.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.359
You say, is it really that rare?

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:17.519
Well, as you drive around, even in our community,

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.559
and you see, you don't even have to go in

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.199
and talk to anyone, you can just see the evidence

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:25.539
that points to the fact that they do not love God's word.

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:28.119
What do you mean by that?

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:29.399
Just read some signs.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.679
They're sending a message, and the message

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.279
that they're sending is a message that they have

00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:39.659
no regard for this book, because the behavior

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:42.659
that they're following is a behavior that's not consistent

00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:44.339
with the teaching of this book.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.779
I was in the store the other day, I don't know

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:48.299
if any of you have these, you know, they want you

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.019
to give your phone number to, you know,

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:52.059
you're a valued customer at whatever place,

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.579
blah, blah, blah, they're gonna give you a discount.

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:57.299
I use Holly's number for all that stuff.

00:14:57.299 --> 00:14:58.699
Glory, hallelujah.

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:02.259
And so, I gave, I was at some place,

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.259
and they said, do you have a number for the whatever,

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:07.319
and I gave them Holly's number, and they said, Holly?

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.559
I said, it's my wife.

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.079
And they said this, they said, well, you know,

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:14.119
these days, you just can't tell anymore.

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:17.899
I was like, let me set this record straight right now.

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:24.999
Holly is my wife, amen, and there is truth.

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:28.799
That's what I told them, there's truth.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:33.059
We live in a world today where they seem like they,

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:34.359
well, you know, I gotta be careful.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.079
If I say something, I could lose my job.

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.859
That's the pressure that people are feeling today.

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:43.759
And we find that there are churches,

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.919
within, broadly speaking, Christendom,

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:49.499
that obviously do not have a love for God's word,

00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:51.379
because if they had a love for God's word,

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:54.879
they would obey it, they would preach it,

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:57.439
they would live it, correct?

00:15:57.819 --> 00:15:58.659
Amen.

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:03.939
If we love the Bible, like the psalmist,

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:05.999
there will be evidence in our lives,

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.579
just like there's evidence within Psalm 119.

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:12.619
Next week, we're gonna look at 10 evidences from Psalm 119,

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:14.899
and there's more than that, but we're gonna look at 10,

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.939
as to how, so you get one point today, 10 next week, amen,

00:16:17.939 --> 00:16:19.499
and we'll make up for it.

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:22.019
But the reality is that there are 10 evidences,

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:25.299
at least 10 evidences in Psalm 119,

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:29.999
that give us the support necessary to say

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:34.239
that the psalmist absolutely, as he made this claim,

00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:38.959
it's not unfounded, no, it's very much sure.

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:40.719
What led to this expression?

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:43.739
He said, oh, how love I thy law.

00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:45.739
Notice with me, again, a number of verses

00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:48.599
within this great chapter of God's word.

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:50.439
I would say what led to this expression,

00:16:50.439 --> 00:16:53.919
number one, the Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:57.179
The Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:59.099
Notice in verse number 98 of this psalm,

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:01.539
the Bible says this, right after, he says,

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:05.019
oh, how love I thy law, it is my meditation all the day.

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:10.019
Thou, through thy commandments, has made me wiser

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:14.299
than mine enemies, for they are ever with me.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:17.319
I have more understanding than all my teachers,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.299
for thy testimonies are my meditation.

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:22.059
That's now every young person's life verse.

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:25.719
Verse 100, I understand more than the ancients,

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:28.639
because I keep thy precepts.

00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:33.639
You know, God's word gives wisdom and understanding.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:39.039
Verse 104, through thy precepts, I get understanding,

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:42.219
therefore, I hate every false way.

00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:44.199
Verse number 130, the Bible says,

00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:47.859
the entrance of thy words giveth light,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:52.639
giveth understanding unto the simple.

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:54.959
And in verse 169, the psalmist says,

00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:57.919
let my cry come near before thee, O Lord.

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:02.919
Give me understanding according to thy word.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.839
Listen, this morning, we need wisdom.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:07.259
We need understanding.

00:18:09.139 --> 00:18:11.999
We find that God's word, the Bible,

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:15.239
gives us wisdom and gives us understanding.

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:17.039
And I'm so thankful for that.

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:19.339
The Bible not only gives wisdom and understanding,

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:21.579
the Bible gives direction.

00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:24.499
How many times in our lives we are praying for direction,

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:27.659
we're seeking that God would provide us with clarity,

00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:31.739
with direction regarding our path, regarding our lives,

00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:34.219
what are the next steps, and so on and so forth.

00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:37.099
And we find that God will lead us.

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:38.940
Many times we look at the Old Testament,

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.019
we're aware of the truth that God led the children of Israel

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:46.619
a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,

00:18:47.199 --> 00:18:49.519
and we think about the way in which God led his people,

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:52.459
and as you study through the Exodus

00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:54.760
and look at God's leadership for his people,

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.079
and you see how specific God was in leading them

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.820
to the place where he led them

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.979
for the purpose that he had for them,

00:19:01.979 --> 00:19:04.839
and God still leads us today.

00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:07.320
I don't have a pillar of cloud or a pillar of fire,

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.919
but I have the Holy Spirit of God that lives within me

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:11.959
that will guide me into all truth,

00:19:11.959 --> 00:19:14.279
and I have the whole canon of Scripture.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.399
You know, in the book of Exodus,

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:17.059
they didn't have the whole Bible.

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:21.139
They needed that pillar of cloud by day

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:23.000
and that pillar of fire by night,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.459
but now today we have the whole Bible,

00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:27.699
and the psalmist says this in verse 105,

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:32.699
thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.859
It's a familiar verse of Scripture,

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:38.899
but oh, how we understand that as the psalmist

00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:40.339
would make this expression,

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:42.139
and we asked the question this morning,

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.119
what led to this expression?

00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:47.179
Why did the psalmist say, oh, how love I thy law?

00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:50.219
Well, it gives wisdom and understanding.

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:53.619
It gives direction.

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:55.059
I would say this.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:57.619
The Bible defines right and wrong.

00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:00.260
Thy word.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:07.220
Word is truth.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:15.700
We live in a society in which they want to remove morals.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.340
They desire to legislate wickedness.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.060
Not desire, they are.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.620
It's no longer just a desire.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.940
It's what they do.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.940
They find that God's Word defines right and wrong.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.380
And listen, it's not for you, it's not for me, it's not for us to have some level of

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.540
subjectivity with regard to right and wrong, evil and good.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.500
No, God's Word is the authority.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.060
And I love God's Word because God's Word tells me what's right and what's wrong.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:56.620
When you live in a culture that's ever-changing, when you live in a people that are departing

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:03.100
from any level of morality, we go back to the standard and we say, no, God's Word defines

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.300
what's right and wrong.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.900
And I'm thankful for that.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.380
And it causes me to love God's Word.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.880
Listen, God never changes.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.060
People change.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.860
But as I tether myself and my morals to God's Word that is unchanging forever, O Lord, thy

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:29.860
Word is settled in heaven, then I can define morals, I can define right and wrong regardless

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.940
of the year.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:37.980
Regardless of how many calendar flips there are, we can define right and wrong.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.220
Notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 119.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.820
We read already verse 104, but the end of that verse says this, it says, through thy

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:51.140
precepts I get understanding, therefore I hate every false way.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.820
The Bible exposes those false ways.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:01.540
Verse 113, he says this, I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:08.820
In verse 128, therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.580
every false way.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.140
Hey, what's right here?

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.140
What's wrong here?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.860
Let's see what God's Word says, because God is the author.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.980
I said this as we studied through Psalm 37, the Bible says in Psalm 37, as the instruction

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.840
is given to the believers, trust in the Lord, in verse number 3, and do good.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.700
We ask this question, what does it mean to do good?

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.500
Good master?

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.900
Not one thing.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.780
Why callest thou me good?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.780
Who's good?

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.780
God is good.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.780
That's what he tells them.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:54.380
And so the good God that we serve is the God who defines what is good.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.340
He defines what is good.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.420
And this morning when we begin to understand this portion of Scripture of Psalm 119, and

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.700
understanding this expression that the psalmist gives, we've looked at for these last several

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:12.000
weeks now the inspiration of God's Word, the preservation of God's Word, the sufficiency

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.540
in the fact that God's Word is superior, and we look at those things and now we come to

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:22.260
the place that say, I love God's Word because I understand what it is, and I understand

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.620
what it does.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.940
It gives understanding, it gives wisdom, it gives direction.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.220
It defines what's right and what's wrong.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.980
It reveals to me who God is.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.380
To know God is to know His Word.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.140
I said that by way of introduction.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:51.580
But apart from this book, you can think of the most anti-God society or culture or whatever

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.500
this morning, and you can think of a people that are idol worshipers and so on and so

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.380
forth, and you can say, listen, we'd be in the same place if we didn't have a Bible that

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:06.620
revealed to us who God is.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:14.020
The story of a missionary that went to a remote area in Asia many, many years ago, decades

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:22.440
ago, and he found as he arrived to that place that the people welcomed him.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.220
There was some opposition leading up to the journey of all that would take place because

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:35.779
of the testimony, if you will, the reputation of that particular people group.

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:40.260
The missionary arrives and finds out that they're welcoming, and there's different reception

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:47.300
than what he anticipated, and he soon finds as he interacts with those of that particular

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.619
people group that there'd been someone that had come there and brought a Bible before

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:54.779
that person had arrived.

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:59.100
They trusted Christ as their Savior, and he found that there are many believers within

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.100
the village.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:06.980
It was exciting because the chief of that particular place, as he spoke with that missionary,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:13.279
he said, you know, it's a really good thing that this happened, that we received the Bible,

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:20.700
because had we not, we would have killed you and eaten you, because that's what we did.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.860
The Bible made the difference.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.779
God's Word changed their lives.

00:25:25.779 --> 00:25:31.300
See, this morning, God reveals Himself to us through His Word.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.140
I want you to consider very quickly this morning as we conclude, I want you to consider how

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.619
the Holy Spirit will use His Word.

00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:42.520
How does He use the Bible in our lives today?

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:48.059
We see the expression of the psalmist, and we know how the psalmist expresses his love

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:54.580
for God's Word, and some reasons within Psalm 119 as to why he would make that declaration.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.500
But this morning, I want you to consider just a few thoughts with regard to how God will

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.779
use His Word in your life and in my life today.

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:04.100
Number one, the Bible will convict you.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.500
The Bible will convict you.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.140
By the way, conviction's a good thing.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.140
It's a good thing to be convicted.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.420
Turn to the book of Acts, if you will, in Acts chapter number 24.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:24.160
In Acts chapter number 24, Paul is giving his testimony here, his defense before Felix.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.700
Sometimes people have the wrong idea.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.420
They think that conviction is a bad thing.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:35.260
I'm thankful that God, the Holy Spirit, will use His Word to convict us.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.300
You know, there are times in which we need our toes stepped on.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.300
Amen?

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.339
By the way, it's a gracious thing that God would convict us.

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:49.140
It's gracious of God.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.760
As Paul was giving his defense before Felix, the Bible says in verse 24, and after certain

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:58.100
days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.540
him concerning the faith in Christ.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.580
And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.779
Now, that's pretty interesting that the Bible speaks of that right there in verse 25 as

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:12.660
to what Paul's message was, because in John, the Bible says that when the Holy Spirit

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.180
comes, He's going to reprove the world of what?

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.800
Of sin, righteousness, and judgment to come.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.020
And here the Bible says that Paul was preaching his reasoning of righteousness, temperance,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.059
and judgment to come.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:28.660
Notice what the Bible says, Felix trembled.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.940
He trembled.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940
Why?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.820
Because God's Word will convict you.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.540
He trembled and answered, go thy way for this time.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.460
When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.140
You know, we have conviction in our life.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.420
There's really two responses.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.619
One is what Felix does.

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:45.619
I'm done with this.

00:27:45.619 --> 00:27:46.619
Get out of here.

00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.220
I don't want to hear any more because I don't like the conviction.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.000
Or we can surrender.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.619
God convicts me and I change.

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:56.619
I respond.

00:27:56.619 --> 00:27:58.820
There are people that have given testimonies.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.059
My dad would share the testimony, a missionary, I think Brother Haley was here and shared

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:06.860
the testimony of someone grabbing the back of a pew, actually it was Brother Dan Hummel

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.980
on Sunday night a couple of weeks ago, and their knuckles turning white under so much

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.580
conviction and just refusing to go forward and submit to the conviction.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.500
There are times in which people will leave, as Felix does, just they don't want to hear

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500
it.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.339
But I'm thankful that the Bible will convict us.

00:28:24.339 --> 00:28:28.260
Listen, by the way, as God's people, we need conviction in our life.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.619
There are times in which God needs to use His Word.

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:35.859
Listen, as I pray, as I read God's Word, God, would you show me, expose to me areas

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:38.660
in my life where I need to change, where it convicts me?

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.900
It's a good thing.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.460
The Bible will convert you.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.419
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Peter, we looked at this verse a few weeks ago.

00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:53.419
In 1 Peter chapter number 1, I read this verse of scripture after the song was sang, the

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:55.460
special music, and we started here.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.020
We were going to be in Psalm 12 to begin, but we started here in 1 Peter 1 on that particular

00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:03.739
Sunday morning, and verse number 23 says, being born again, aren't you thankful to be

00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:04.739
saved?

00:29:04.739 --> 00:29:06.859
What does it mean to be born again?

00:29:06.859 --> 00:29:11.619
They use the term today, again, I've mentioned this before, that there are many false teachers,

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:16.260
and here's what false teachers do, they'll use our terms, but they use a different definition.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.260
I've been born again.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.260
What does it mean to be born again?

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.260
Well, I was baptized.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.780
That's not what it means to be born again.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.340
Nope.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.340
Is that right?

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.340
Biblically speaking, baptism does not equal being born again.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.940
Now, if you're born again, you ought to be baptized.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.619
First step of obedience, amen?

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:36.140
If you're born again, you ought to be scripturally baptized.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:42.380
But being baptized does not mean that you're born again.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.500
Remember what Jesus said to Nicodemus, marvel not that I said unto thee that ye must be

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.340
born again.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.419
Praise the Lord.

00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:57.140
The second birth, glory, hallelujah, when you trust the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.299
Savior, understanding that you're a sinner and that He's the only one that can save you.

00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:04.539
only Savior, and you can't get to heaven on your own. I talked to a man just on Friday,

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:08.819
the same guy that I gave Holly's number to, and I said this, I said, listen, do you go

00:30:08.819 --> 00:30:12.059
to church anywhere? He said, man, and he kind of gave me an answer, and I said, let me ask

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:15.739
you this, are you 100% sure if you were to die today you'd go to heaven? Right at the

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:21.499
checkout line, no one else was in line, so I was able to ask him. He said, you know,

00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:26.939
I can't say I'm 100% sure, but I'm okay with whatever because I know I've sinned. That's

00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:32.459
what he said. That's what he said to me. And I said this, I said, you know, I just

00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:39.539
use my credit card to pay for that transaction. I said, the reality is that no one at the

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:44.779
credit card company really cares who pays the credit card bill. I made the transaction,

00:30:44.779 --> 00:30:54.739
so I'm responsible for it, but if my dad wants to pay for it, he can. Right? The credit card

00:30:54.739 --> 00:31:00.619
company doesn't care, as long as it gets paid. Here's what I said, you've done some

00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:06.579
things wrong. You just admitted that, that you're a sinner, but Jesus paid for it. Jesus

00:31:06.579 --> 00:31:13.979
paid for it, and that satisfies the Father, and that's a glorious truth of God's Word,

00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:20.059
the substitutionary atonement. And listen, God's Word, he says, being born again, not

00:31:20.059 --> 00:31:24.579
of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth

00:31:24.579 --> 00:31:29.579
forever. Hallelujah for salvation. Listen, the Bible will convict you, it'll convert

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:33.579
you. Number three, the Bible will correct you. You ever have a time that you're wrong

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:38.819
in your thinking? Sure there are. Times that we're wrong in our thinking, and we need our

00:31:38.819 --> 00:31:45.379
thinking to be corrected. We have a wrong perspective, a wrong view, and we find that

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:50.699
God's Word will correct us. In 2 Timothy 3, we've read this verse, all Scripture, in verse

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:54.939
16, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:59.459
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:05.459
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. This morning, there are times in which

00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:09.459
we need correction. Don't worry about somebody else that needs correction. Recognize that

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:13.899
there are times in your life that you need correction. You know what happens sometimes?

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:22.899
You don't like being corrected. Most people don't like being corrected. You know why?

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:30.019
Pride. Pride. Because in order to be corrected means I have to acknowledge I was wrong. Most

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:39.779
people don't like to acknowledge when they're wrong. Yeah, that was my dad, real loud. Have

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:46.019
you been wrong yet this year? Yeah, probably not. It's only March. Lying in church. You

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:54.739
better move, Mom. Pierre, you might want to back up too, amen? But understand that we

00:32:54.739 --> 00:33:02.819
need correction. We need correction. God's Word corrects. Let me say this. This is precious.

00:33:02.819 --> 00:33:11.499
God's Word comforts. I want you to think about this. This book, it's a living book.

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:16.939
And this book, all in the same session of reading it, if you want to call it that, and

00:33:16.939 --> 00:33:21.659
time with the Lord, hearing preaching of God's Word, whatever it might be, that this book

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:29.419
can convict you and comfort you at the same time. It's amazing. Notice what the Bible

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:36.179
says in 1 Thessalonians. Look at what the Bible says. In 1 Thessalonians, these believers

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:39.939
of Thessalonica, there's confusion with regard to some things with regard to the coming of

00:33:39.939 --> 00:33:43.699
the Lord and so on and so forth, and we find there's even more confusion as you look at

00:33:43.699 --> 00:33:48.099
the second letter that's written, and Paul is giving them instruction, and we find that

00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:53.179
it's a precious passage of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians 4, beginning in verse 13, and

00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:57.379
going through the end of the passage, and we find that Paul says, I would, notice how

00:33:57.379 --> 00:34:03.779
he begins in verse 13, but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:08.699
which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. And we find

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:14.819
that Paul is desiring that these believers in Thessalonica, and of course it's been preserved

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:20.319
for us this morning, that we would have, that we would be informed with regard to these

00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:25.940
things, and we find that he's speaking the Word of the Lord. He says that in verse number

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:32.299
15, for this we say unto you, by the Word of the Lord. It's not Paul just giving a pep

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:37.859
talk in his idea, his thoughts. No, he's giving the Scripture, and he's giving the Word of

00:34:37.859 --> 00:34:42.299
the Lord, and he ends the passage of Scripture. I don't know how many times I've read this

00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:46.899
portion of Scripture, and I've been encouraged with 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 18, where

00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:56.139
the Bible says, wherefore, comfort one another with what? With these words, these words.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:35:00.500
See, God is the God of all comfort. You read 2 Corinthians chapter number 1, and you find

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.819
that to be declared for us. He is the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all of

00:35:05.819 --> 00:35:09.299
our infirmities. Every problem we have, God is the Comforter. Listen, the Holy Spirit

00:35:09.299 --> 00:35:15.059
of God, one of His divine names that's described to Him is the Comforter. But you know God

00:35:15.059 --> 00:35:22.019
uses His Word to comfort us. How many times we've had troubled hearts? Maybe as the disciples

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:27.659
had troubled hearts in John 14, after they heard all that Jesus had shared with them

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:34.699
in chapter 13 about the cross, and Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled. Why does He

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:38.339
make that statement? Because He knows that their heart's troubled, and He's going to

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:43.299
comfort them. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me. And

00:35:43.299 --> 00:35:47.099
then He gives them that wonderful promise that I will come again and receive you unto

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:52.619
Myself. You look at that passage in John 14, verses 1 through 3, how powerful that is.

00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:57.139
In a group of men, these disciples that had hearts that were troubled are now able to

00:35:57.139 --> 00:36:03.239
be comforted through the words of Jesus. You ever been in a situation where someone has

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:08.699
said to you, thank you for those words, they were a comfort. No doubt somebody said that

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:12.459
to you at some point in your life. Have you ever been in a place where you've been interacting

00:36:12.459 --> 00:36:15.739
with somebody that's having a difficulty and you feel like you don't know what to say?

00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:22.379
You ever been in that position? I just don't know what to say here. A loss of a loved one

00:36:22.379 --> 00:36:27.459
or some other tragic situation, and we might be in that place where we feel like, listen,

00:36:27.459 --> 00:36:33.819
speak God's Word, because God's Word gives comfort. Almost every funeral I've ever preached,

00:36:33.819 --> 00:36:40.579
at some point I'm visiting 1 Thessalonians 4. Why? Because we sorrow not as others which

00:36:40.579 --> 00:36:47.779
have no hope. And he says, wherefore comfort one another with these words. It's amazing

00:36:47.779 --> 00:36:53.579
how God's Word comforts the heart of His people. The Bible will convict you, convert you, comfort

00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:59.859
or correct you, comfort you. Finally, this morning, the Bible should change you. The

00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:06.659
Bible should change you. The Bible tells us in James 1 and verse 22 that we're to be doers

00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:13.539
of the Word and not hearers only. Of course, we're familiar with the song that we sing

00:37:13.539 --> 00:37:18.500
with the children that's a result of the teaching of Christ about the wise man and the foolish

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:27.220
man. And we speak about that, or we sing that song and we speak about that portion of Scripture.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:34.979
We find that in both situations they heard the teaching of Jesus, but one was obedient

00:37:34.979 --> 00:37:42.859
and one was disobedient. One did and one did not. And this morning we think about the

00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:48.139
Bible changing us. I wonder this morning, if you look at your life, if you look at your

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:55.539
Christian life, how much has God's Word changed you? How much has God's Word changed you?

00:37:55.539 --> 00:38:03.859
You remember the maniac at Gadara? Jesus came, the living Word, and He spoke the Word of

00:38:03.859 --> 00:38:11.220
God to him. And that maniac at Gadara was transformed. Why? Well, because the Bible

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:19.899
convicts, converts. No doubt it corrected. There was some comfort, understanding that

00:38:19.899 --> 00:38:24.979
Jesus is the Savior. There was a change. Those people came back and they found that this

00:38:24.979 --> 00:38:32.979
man who was demon-possessed is now clothed in his right mind and he's sitting at the

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:38.459
feet of Jesus. There was a change in that man's life. What do you think about Paul?

00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:46.339
His name was Saul before he was converted. In Acts 9, he's traveling the road to Damascus.

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:49.859
He's traveling not alone, there's other people with him, but he sees this light and he hears

00:38:49.859 --> 00:39:04.419
the Lord. Who art thou, Lord? I am Jesus. Can you imagine? Saul says, what wilt thou

00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:11.820
have me to do? If you read Acts chapter 9 and you skip the middle portion of that passage

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.700
of Scripture, you will be confused beyond confused. Because Acts 9 begins with him

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:26.799
going to slaughter, going to arrest. And then you get to Acts 9 and verse 20 and the Bible

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:34.779
says in a straight way, he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

00:39:34.779 --> 00:39:42.459
Saul, what happened? Jesus stepped in, changed his life. Would you acknowledge this morning

00:39:42.459 --> 00:39:48.459
that Saul was never the same after this experience in Acts chapter 9? And I wonder this morning,

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:55.380
has God's Word changed you? Can you look in your life and can you see how God's Word has

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.380
changed you? I hope you can. And I hope that it continues.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.340
continues to change us because we are to be conformed to the image of His dear Son, to

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.860
be like Christ.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:13.700
And every day of our lives, we need to have this book a part of our lives.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.700
Why?

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.700
Because it will convict.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:20.420
I hope that you've been converted.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:28.460
It'll correct, comfort, and change us, oh, that we would be more like Christ.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:35.940
This morning, the psalmist declares, oh, how love I thy law.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.940
What made him say that?

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.860
Well, he understood that the Bible gives wisdom and understanding.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.300
He understood that the Bible gives direction.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.460
He understands that the Bible defines right and wrong.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:54.620
He understood that the Bible reveals who God is, thus declaring, expressing His love for

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.620
this book.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.180
He didn't even have all that we have.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:06.300
Oh, this morning, I believe that we ought to echo the words of the psalmist.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.880
As we'll mention, as I've already mentioned and we'll look at next week, if we echo those

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.300
words, is there evidence that will support our claim?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:22.900
Is there evidence in your life, is there evidence in my life that would support the claim that

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.760
I love this book?

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:34.380
Look at 10 things next week from Psalm 119 that reveal to us overwhelming evidence that

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:41.020
supports the claim of the psalmist, oh, how love I thy law.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.780
This morning, I hope you'll just thank God for His Word.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.780
Let's pray.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.780
Father, we love You.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.940
We thank You for loving us.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.220
We thank You for the Bible.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:00.420
We could not, we would not be here this morning if it wasn't for Your Word.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.420
We could not sing the songs that we sang.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:12.860
We could not rejoice in the things that we rejoiced in had we not had Your Word.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:20.820
But I thank You for the expression of the psalmist, expresses his love for Your Word.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:30.660
As we've sought to walk through the 119th Psalm to analyze why he would make that declaration,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:37.740
I trust that this morning, each of us would echo the words of the psalmist, say, oh, how

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.740
love I thy law.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.620
God, I pray that You'd help us.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.820
Thank You as we should for this book.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.540
Help us to never neglect it, set it aside.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:58.620
Lord, I pray that You'd help us daily to get into Your Word so that Your Word would get

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.580
into our lives and change us.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.460
Help us to be submitted to Thy Word.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.059
I pray, Father, that as we rejoice and thank You for giving us Your Word that we'd be careful

00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:14.860
to share the truth of Your Word with those that we come into contact with, knowing that

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.020
just as it's benefited us, it'll benefit them.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.220
Just as it's changed us, it'll change them.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.180
I pray that You'd help us to be faithful.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:30.460
Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray that this morning, You would convict

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.820
them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment to come.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.620
Before they leave this place or log off of livestream, they would trust Christ as their

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.419
personal Savior.

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:45.740
Help us, Lord, now to respond as we should, and we'll thank You for it.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.180
Would you stand with me?
