1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Chronicles chapter 24 this evening,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,039
2 Chronicles chapter number 24,

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,199
and I'm thankful for God's word,

4
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:10,960
I'm thankful for the truth that is contained therein.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,840
The Bible says that all scripture

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,880
is given by inspiration of God,

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
and it says this, that it's profitable for us,

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,719
and I'm thankful that God's word

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,680
has been given by inspiration,

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,719
it's been divinely preserved for us today,

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,739
we can have confidence in what we hold in our hands

12
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,959
as being the complete canon of scripture,

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:33,139
and we can find that as God has recorded

14
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:35,459
what he has chosen to record for us,

15
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,900
that it's for our benefit, it is to help us,

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,180
it is profitable for us,

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,540
as we look at 2 Chronicles chapter 24 this evening,

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,080
I'm trusting that God will allow me

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,240
to extract some lessons from this text of scripture

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,020
as we read and study part of the life of Joash

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,259
as it's recorded here in 2 Chronicles chapter 24,

22
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:00,580
and I hope that it would be a blessing to us

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,159
as we look at this portion of scripture,

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,800
obviously this evening we have the Farewell Fellowship

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,400
for Kid Emei and for Brianna,

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,900
and they're going to be heading off to college,

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,480
Kid Emei leaves on Thursday,

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,800
and then Brianna leaves on the 29th of August,

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,959
and so some of these lessons here,

30
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,779
specifically in mind for these two young ladies

31
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,160
that are heading off to college,

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,639
everyone else gets to participate this evening,

33
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,620
and we get to hear these lessons,

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,900
but just six thoughts tonight,

35
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,879
so I'll try to go pretty quickly

36
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,919
and then get into the remainder of the service this evening,

37
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,139
but notice in verse number one,

38
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:34,980
the Bible says this,

39
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,839
Joash was seven years old when it began to rain,

40
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,599
and it rained 40 years in Jerusalem,

41
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,599
his mother's name also was Zebiah of Beersheba,

42
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,559
and Joash, notice the Bible says that he did that

43
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,919
which was right in the sight of the Lord,

44
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:55,919
but it says this, all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

45
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,599
and the next several verses of scripture

46
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,580
in the text of scripture will provide us

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,639
with some of the actions that take place

48
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,860
and there under the beginning of the rain

49
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,179
of Joash as being king,

50
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,339
we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 15,

51
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:17,419
but Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died,

52
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,619
and 130 years old was he when he died,

53
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,940
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,580
because he had done good in Israel,

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,639
both toward God and toward his house,

56
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,440
Jehoiada was a man that served God faithfully,

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,880
we find that he had influence on the life of Joash,

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
as we look at this portion of scripture,

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
we're gonna look at the whole chapter

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,880
and just seek to extract some lessons

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,880
that I hope would be applicable for each of us this evening

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
as we look at this portion of scripture

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,199
and seek to glean principles

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,220
that would guide us in our living,

65
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,399
number one, if you're taking notes this evening,

66
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,360
I want you to consider with me the importance

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,520
of having a spiritual mentor in your life,

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,820
the importance of having a spiritual mentor in your life,

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,139
and I would say this, and to be accountable,

70
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,660
accountability is something

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,699
that's missing in our society today,

72
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:07,740
in fact, a lot of people

73
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,339
don't wanna be accountable to anyone,

74
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,580
a lot of people don't wanna be accountable,

75
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,020
if you read the book of Romans in the first chapter,

76
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,339
they deny the existence of God simply

77
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,580
because they don't wanna be accountable to God,

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,419
and we live in a time and an era

79
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:23,300
in this particular day that we're living in

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,380
where people simply don't wanna be accountable,

81
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
but I believe this evening that it's important

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,479
that we recognize that it's vital

83
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,679
that we have spiritual mentors in our lives,

84
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,800
now as young people, as I would think about

85
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,520
giving this message to Brianna and to Kiademe

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
as they head off to college,

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,639
obviously this new phase of life for them,

88
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,160
but for each of us this evening,

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,240
we understand the importance

90
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,479
of having spiritual mentors in our lives,

91
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,360
in fact, at some point in our lives,

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
we would trust that as the cycle of life would go forward,

93
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,940
that we would become a spiritual mentor

94
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,779
in someone else's life,

95
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,259
but even at that point, it's important

96
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:03,479
that we still continue to have mentors in our own life,

97
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,320
and that we have people that we're able to counsel with,

98
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,539
I'm thankful that God's word gives counsel,

99
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,179
I'm thankful for the truth that's contained therein,

100
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,039
but God told us within the pages of his word

101
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,660
that there's safety in the multitude of counselors,

102
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,859
and so we find that God has provided for us,

103
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,380
I still have in my life,

104
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,040
I have men that I will pick up the phone,

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,119
and I will call that I refer to,

106
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:29,839
and I look to as being spiritual mentors in my life,

107
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,540
I've reached the age in my particular life and ministry,

108
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,720
where now I receive the phone calls from younger preachers

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,679
that are saying, hey, I got this problem,

110
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,239
I got this situation,

111
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,619
and I begin to try to give them some biblical counsel,

112
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:45,000
when I think about Joash,

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,519
and this understanding of the importance

114
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,640
of having a spiritual mentor,

115
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,440
and obviously being accountable,

116
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,619
we notice that the Bible says that Jehoiada here

117
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,220
had great influence in the life of Joash,

118
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,980
so much so that the Bible says in verse number two

119
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,299
of our text that Joash did that which was right

120
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,459
in the sight of the Lord,

121
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,559
all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

122
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,779
it's kind of interesting,

123
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,899
as you study through the Kings and Chronicles,

124
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,899
as you have the opportunity to study

125
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,299
what God has recorded of their lives,

126
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:15,619
many times you will read where the Bible will speak about

127
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:18,500
all the days of their lives,

128
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,640
but here specifically the Bible says that he did that

129
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
which was right in the sight of the Lord,

130
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,440
all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

131
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,320
there's a distinct difference in how God

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,739
gives us this truth,

133
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:36,720
how he articulates the life of Joash,

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
and helps us to understand,

135
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,119
and so we see the influence,

136
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,160
this spiritual mentorship, if you will,

137
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,260
that Jehoiada had in the life of Joash,

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,399
we read again, notice in verse number six,

139
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,859
we'll keep reading in verse number three,

140
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,500
and Jehoiada took for him two wives,

141
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,619
and begat sons and daughters,

142
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,299
and it came to pass after this,

143
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,140
that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord,

144
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,380
that's a good thing,

145
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,760
and the Bible says in verse number five

146
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,700
that he gathered together the priests and the Levites,

147
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,619
and said to them,

148
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,339
go out unto the cities of Judah,

149
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,160
and gather of all Israel money

150
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,779
to repair the house of your God,

151
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,660
from year to year,

152
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,779
and see that ye hasten the matter,

153
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,660
how be it the Levites hastened it not,

154
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:19,119
and again, Joash had good intentions here,

155
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,640
it was a good thing to repair the house of the Lord,

156
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,140
he says let's do it with haste,

157
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,320
the Levites however hastened not,

158
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,799
notice in verse number six,

159
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,079
the Bible says the king called for who,

160
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,119
he called for Jehoiada the chief,

161
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,799
there was a relationship there,

162
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,959
between Jehoiada and Joash,

163
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,200
and he calls for Jehoiada the chief,

164
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,519
and notice when he says to him,

165
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,160
why hast thou not required of the Levites

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,440
to bring in out of Judah,

167
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,359
and out of Jerusalem the collection,

168
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,859
according to the commandment of Moses,

169
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,220
the servant of the Lord,

170
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,579
and of the congregation of Israel,

171
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,179
for the tabernacle of witness,

172
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,100
if you were to skip down,

173
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
and look at verse 12 and 14 with me,

174
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,179
I want you to notice again,

175
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:57,380
there's a phrase that's mentioned,

176
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,459
that I think gives us some insight,

177
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,859
with regard to the relationship,

178
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,579
between Joash and Jehoiada,

179
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:04,700
notice in verse number 12,

180
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,679
the Bible says and the king and Jehoiada,

181
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,260
it says it again in verse number 14,

182
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,100
in the middle of the verse,

183
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,339
the king and Jehoiada,

184
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,179
notice in verse number 12,

185
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,459
it says and the king and Jehoiada,

186
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,339
gave it to such as did,

187
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,119
the work of the service of the house of the Lord,

188
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,720
and hired masons and carpenters,

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,299
to repair the house of the Lord,

190
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,420
and also such as wrought iron and brass,

191
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,519
and to mend the house of the Lord,

192
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,200
gave what gave that offering,

193
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
that he was speaking of,

194
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,160
in verses five and six,

195
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,440
we find that the Bible tells us,

196
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
that the workmen wrought,

197
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,320
in verse number 13,

198
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,679
the work was perfected by them,

199
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,720
they set the house of God in a state,

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
and strengthened it,

201
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,399
and when they had finished it,

202
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,720
they brought the rest of the money,

203
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,779
before the king and Jehoiada,

204
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,940
again, I mentioned verse 12 and 14,

205
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,119
use that phraseology,

206
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:48,959
the king and Jehoiada,

207
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,500
again seeing the relationship,

208
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,059
whereof were made vessels,

209
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:52,940
for the house of the Lord,

210
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,459
even vessels to minister,

211
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,220
and to offer with all in spoons,

212
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,820
and vessels of gold and silver,

213
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,299
and they offered burnt offerings,

214
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,299
in the house of the Lord continually,

215
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,260
notice it says again,

216
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
all the days of Jehoiada,

217
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,019
it's interesting that Joash is the king,

218
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,019
but this is the second time,

219
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,779
that we read about all the days of Jehoiada,

220
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,700
and we find here,

221
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,399
that Jehoiada had an impact,

222
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,239
and influence,

223
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,040
he had this role of being a spiritual mentor,

224
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,359
in the life of Joash,

225
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,760
it's vital,

226
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
it is absolutely essential,

227
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,000
that we have a spiritual mentor in our lives,

228
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,519
somebody that we can look to,

229
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,079
that we can counsel with,

230
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,399
that we can understand,

231
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,519
that there's safety,

232
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,840
as I mentioned a moment ago,

233
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,659
and the multitude of counselors,

234
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,960
the Bible speaks obviously,

235
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,039
as you look at the New Testament,

236
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,159
you think about the role of the Apostle Paul,

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,520
the Apostle Paul was a man,

238
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,979
that sought the face of God,

239
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,739
he was a man that followed the Lord,

240
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,219
and he says to those that he's ministering to,

241
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,559
he says be followers of me,

242
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,539
as I follow the Lord,

243
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,859
and we find that Paul was a man,

244
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:54,940
as we look at his life,

245
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,719
that he had the opportunity,

246
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,919
the role that he played,

247
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,940
in the lives of Timothy and Titus,

248
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,700
he speaks about them as being,

249
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,320
his sons in the faith,

250
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,419
but we understand that he had a spiritual mentorship,

251
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,700
in their lives,

252
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,299
in fact we find that Paul,

253
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,859
very carefully in the book of 1st and 2nd Timothy,

254
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:13,099
in the book of Titus,

255
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,659
gives them the instruction with regard,

256
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,320
to following the example that he set forth,

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,760
this evening we see first of all,

258
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,900
number lesson number one,

259
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,020
from this portion of scripture,

260
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,619
the importance of having a spiritual mentor,

261
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:26,780
in our lives,

262
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,340
and the importance of being accountable,

263
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,580
spiritual mentors are designed to help us,

264
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,780
in our spiritual journey,

265
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,140
spiritual mentor,

266
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,580
you think about accountability,

267
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,859
and the truth of being accountable,

268
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,299
someone made this distinction,

269
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,840
to seek counsel,

270
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,340
is to get answers to your questions,

271
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,599
to be accountable,

272
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,799
is to give answers to the questions asked,

273
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,820
I think that's a very minor distinction,

274
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,059
but listen to it again,

275
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,739
to seek counsel,

276
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:57,219
is to get answers to your questions,

277
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,979
lots of people seek counsel.

278
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,959
They want answers to their questions.

279
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,379
To be accountable is to give answers

280
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,759
to the questions that are asked.

281
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,519
How are you doing spiritually?

282
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,399
How's your walk with God?

283
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,879
How's your prayer life?

284
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,679
How's your Bible reading?

285
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,799
That's being accountable.

286
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,279
Spiritually, spiritual mentorship,

287
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,519
asking those questions.

288
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,119
Listen, a lot of times,

289
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,479
I mentioned this a few weeks ago on a Sunday morning,

290
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,599
a lot of times we don't ask those kind of questions.

291
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:29,159
We kind of almost act like that's a part of our lives

292
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,799
that we don't deal with, that we don't really focus on,

293
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,199
but it ought to be that we have

294
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,479
some spiritual accountability to those

295
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,879
that would be our spiritual mentors.

296
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,159
Number two, lesson number two.

297
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,359
I would say this.

298
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,839
As we look at the life of Joash,

299
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,759
we see very obviously in the text of Scripture

300
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,759
the importance of developing a personal walk with God.

301
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:52,699
We could never overemphasize this evening

302
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,839
the importance of a personal walk with the Lord.

303
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,999
We need to develop that personally.

304
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,559
Listen, someone said years ago,

305
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,439
a preacher of yesteryear, God has no grandchildren.

306
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,279
What does he mean by that?

307
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,839
Well, we're all sons and daughters of the Lord.

308
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,959
He has no grandkids.

309
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,519
If you are saved, if you're heaven-bound,

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,999
it's because you trust that Christ is your Savior,

311
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,199
and he adopted you into his family,

312
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,119
and he says, behold, what manner of love

313
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,639
the Father hath bestowed upon us

314
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,319
that we should be called the sons of God.

315
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:25,559
What a wonderful truth that God gives us in his word,

316
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,439
and we understand that as we seek

317
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,239
to develop this personal walk with God

318
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,959
that the importance of it,

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,719
and we understand that it's not just the God of my mentor,

320
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,719
it's not just the God of my parents,

321
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:42,159
it's not just the God of the pastor, but it's my God.

322
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,759
It's a personal thing.

323
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,239
We find here, I want you to see in the text of Scripture,

324
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,679
I read verse number 15 by way of introduction,

325
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,899
but we find this.

326
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,899
At some point, a spiritual mentor will pass into eternity.

327
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:59,279
And then what happens with our own personal walk with God?

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,319
In the life of Joash, it's terrible what happens.

329
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,159
The contrast between the first 16 verses

330
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,839
of 2 Chronicles 24, and then from verse 17 to 27,

331
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,319
that last portion, it's absolutely mind-boggling

332
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,839
as you look at the contrast in these portions of Scripture,

333
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,839
but what changed?

334
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,359
Well, the Bible says in verse 15,

335
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:24,559
but Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died.

336
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,519
He was 130 years old, and that's when he died,

337
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,039
and we find that this was a very important turning point

338
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,439
in the life of Joash.

339
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,439
In fact, the Bible says in verse 17,

340
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,639
now after the death of Jehoiada,

341
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
and we're gonna notice in just a moment what takes place,

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,919
but I ask this question,

343
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,799
how do we develop a personal walk with God?

344
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,919
It's good that the preacher can stand up and say,

345
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,039
hey, listen, it's important

346
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,799
that you have a personal walk with God.

347
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,539
How do I develop that personal walk with God?

348
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,479
What is it that I do?

349
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,319
Why should I develop a personal walk with God?

350
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,039
And the reality is that as we look at God's word

351
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,559
and we understand the truth of salvation

352
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,159
and we understand being adopted in the family of God,

353
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,159
we should have a desire to know him personally.

354
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,759
I don't wanna, I said this morning,

355
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,079
I don't wanna just hear from somebody else

356
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:15,999
what God is doing.

357
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,959
I wanna personally experience the greatness of God.

358
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,479
It's not enough to just know about God.

359
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:25,879
We see as what Paul said in the book of Philippians,

360
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,559
that I may know him.

361
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,119
And having that intimate fellowship

362
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,239
and that walk with the Lord.

363
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,639
We do not walk with the Lord.

364
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,419
We don't seek to develop a walk with the Lord

365
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,279
so that we can maintain our salvation.

366
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,079
We know that that's not the biblically accurate

367
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,219
or biblically true.

368
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,799
We seek to walk with the Lord daily.

369
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,559
We sang this morning, trust and obey.

370
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,599
And we think about the walking

371
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,799
and that daily walking with the Lord.

372
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,639
And we find that the Bible gives us so much insight

373
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,879
as we seek the face of God.

374
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,719
I hope this morning, this evening,

375
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,279
as we consider our walk with God

376
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,919
and developing our walk with God,

377
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,479
that we're working on it.

378
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,319
That we're seeking to be closer to God today

379
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,759
than we were yesterday,

380
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,799
than we were a month ago, a year ago, five years ago.

381
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,199
Because that closeness with God,

382
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,159
that drawing nigh unto the Lord,

383
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,559
drawing near to God is so vital

384
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,199
for our spiritual journey as we go through life.

385
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,039
Why?

386
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,959
Because we have an enemy.

387
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,359
And the enemy wants to devour us and destroy us.

388
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:31,119
And we find this evening that it's absolutely essential

389
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,919
that we would understand the importance

390
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,539
that yes, we have a spiritual mentor,

391
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,759
but we can't just ride the coattails

392
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,199
of our spiritual mentor.

393
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,199
We must develop a personal walk with God.

394
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,679
At some point in life,

395
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,719
you want to teach your children

396
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,759
how to live life on their own.

397
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,959
You teach them how to,

398
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,659
you know, there's a time in parenting

399
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,639
that you spoon feed your children.

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,059
Y'all understand what I mean when I say that.

401
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,919
When you do the little thing as,

402
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,119
you know, they don't want to eat the broccoli

403
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,679
and you're trying to act like it's an airplane

404
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,359
and you're doing all this kind of nonsense

405
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,919
to get them to eat the broccoli

406
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,239
and you're trying to make it palatable for them

407
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,399
and so on and so forth.

408
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,239
But at some point,

409
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,439
you want them to be able to feed themselves.

410
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,639
And this evening,

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,239
we understand the importance of the mentor,

412
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,699
but we understand this evening

413
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,999
that it's absolutely essential

414
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,679
that we develop a personal walk with God.

415
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,879
When I think about the role of a pastor

416
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,839
and also as a parent, a spiritual leader,

417
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,039
we understand the Bible tells me as a pastor

418
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,239
that I'm to feed the flock of God.

419
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,639
That's a biblical responsibility that I have

420
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,399
is to feed the flock of God.

421
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:44,959
But you know,

422
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,079
if the only time the flock of God gets fed

423
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,039
is when the pastor stands up and preaches a message,

424
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,279
the flock of God is going to be anemic,

425
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,639
malnourished.

426
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,479
It's just true.

427
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,239
It's the way it works.

428
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:02,079
If the only time the flock of God is being fed,

429
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,199
no, so the pastor, yes, is to feed.

430
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,559
That's a job, a role,

431
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,099
that's a responsibility that the pastor has,

432
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,479
but the flock needs to learn how to feast

433
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,959
on God's word themselves.

434
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,319
Study to show thyself approved unto God,

435
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,999
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

436
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:22,119
rightly dividing the word of truth.

437
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,559
As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word,

438
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,599
that ye may grow thereby.

439
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,159
But grow in grace and knowledge

440
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,719
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

441
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:32,199
And we find that all of these truths are given to us,

442
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,199
and so the focus on the importance

443
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,259
of developing that personal walk with God,

444
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,279
it's something we have to work on.

445
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,999
It's not gonna happen by accident.

446
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,279
Number three, lessons from the life of Joash.

447
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,099
Number three, be careful who influences you.

448
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,899
Somebody's trying to influence you.

449
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,599
Somebody's trying to influence me.

450
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,879
And we need to be careful of the tactics

451
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,039
and the approaches of those that would seek to influence us.

452
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,639
As we look at this text of scripture,

453
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,079
and we come, verse 15 speaks of the death of Jehoiada.

454
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,879
Verse 16, the burial of Jehoiada.

455
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,679
But we come to verse 17, and the Bible says,

456
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,499
now, after the death of Jehoiada,

457
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,759
notice what the Bible says, came the princes of Judah.

458
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
Notice what they do.

459
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,999
They made obeisance to the king.

460
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,119
Then the king hearkened unto them.

461
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,859
Someone's trying to influence you.

462
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,199
Someone's trying to influence me.

463
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,319
So often we think about the truth of influence,

464
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,959
we think about young people,

465
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,439
and certainly that's a big truth

466
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,599
and a big important recognition that we have

467
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,479
that someone's trying to influence our young people.

468
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:42,359
But I want you to know that as adults, senior saints,

469
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,479
somebody's trying to influence you.

470
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,719
Listen, we need to be careful who influences us.

471
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,959
You know what's amazing today?

472
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,919
It used to be that we could really limit

473
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,459
those who influenced us because we didn't have

474
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,959
so many things available at the touch of a button.

475
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,119
But I would say to you this evening

476
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,119
that we're being influenced by social media.

477
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,479
I don't have social media.

478
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,519
I hear a whole lot about social media.

479
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,759
I don't have it.

480
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,519
I'm not saying that I'm against it,

481
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,279
that I'm not preaching against it.

482
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,759
I'm just saying we need to be careful.

483
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,599
We need to be careful, why?

484
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,719
Because there's influence.

485
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,519
There's influence.

486
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,479
The books that we read, the things that we watch,

487
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,599
the people that we run with, and so on and so forth.

488
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,439
And notice how these individuals,

489
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,719
they really are using flattery.

490
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,359
The Bible says that they come and these princes of Judah,

491
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,500
they made obeisance to the king.

492
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,919
They made obeisance to the king.

493
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:37,959
And then the Bible says,

494
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:41,839
then the king hearkened unto them.

495
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,479
Isn't that sad?

496
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,839
The Bible tells us in verse 18

497
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,599
that they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers

498
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,479
and served groves and idols,

499
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,559
and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem

500
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,199
for this their trespass.

501
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,599
Now, I want you to understand

502
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,699
that while Jehoiada was still alive,

503
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:02,039
that Joash was the one that commissioned,

504
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,559
in verse number four,

505
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,519
the repair of the house of the Lord.

506
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,579
He was the one that not only commissioned

507
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,779
the repair of the house of the Lord in verse number four,

508
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,599
but he was the one that said, let's hasten the matter.

509
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,919
He was the one that when they hastened not,

510
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,440
that he calls for Jehoiada and he says,

511
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,959
hey, what's going on here?

512
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,820
Why aren't you making them do this?

513
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,359
Then all of a sudden, Jehoiada dies.

514
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,959
These princes of Judah come and they make obeisance

515
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,039
to the king and the king hearkens unto them.

516
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,599
They leave the house of the Lord, their God,

517
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,239
and they go and they serve groves and idols.

518
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,760
Could scratch their head and say,

519
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,440
how in the world does that happen?

520
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,599
Well, number one, there's a lack of a personal walk with God

521
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,119
in the life of Joash.

522
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,119
Influence is powerful.

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,839
Influence is powerful.

524
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,599
People are seeking to influence us.

525
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,899
At times, we don't even know it.

526
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,839
Have you ever heard something and you walked away?

527
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,159
This happened to both Holly and I just this past week.

528
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,359
We walked away and we said, I think that was good,

529
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,179
but I'm suspicious as to what the underlying message was.

530
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,719
You ever feel that way?

531
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,719
You hear something and you're like,

532
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,599
I think at the surface it sounds like it's okay,

533
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,439
but knowing the source, I think something,

534
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,119
what did I miss?

535
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,079
We both walked away from a situation with that same thought

536
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,559
and we have to be careful who we allow to influence us.

537
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
We speak about choosing our friends wisely.

538
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,719
Oh, how important that is.

539
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,639
We live in a society today,

540
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,679
how many friends are following somebody

541
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,399
on some social media platform

542
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,799
and all of this important stuff of I have this

543
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,919
and I have that, so we gotta be careful.

544
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:00,919
I remember years ago, someone said this to me,

545
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,799
it's better to have no friends than the wrong friends.

546
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,839
Man, how important that is to understand that truth.

547
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,719
And we find this evening that we must be careful,

548
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,279
lesson number three of who influences us.

549
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,599
Jehoiada allowed for the princes of Judah

550
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,199
to have influence in his life

551
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,399
and a man that was concerned about repairing

552
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:22,839
the house of the Lord, a man that was hastening

553
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,399
the repair of the house of the Lord

554
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,299
now leaves the house of the Lord

555
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,239
and the Bible says they're serving groves and idols.

556
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,779
It gets worse from there.

557
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,219
The Bible tells us in verse number 20 that Zechariah,

558
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:36,899
the son of Jehoiada, the priest,

559
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,179
came and stood and delivered a message

560
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,779
and the Bible says that they conspired to kill him

561
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,979
and it says in verse 22,

562
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,379
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness

563
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:47,499
which Jehoiada, his father, had done to him

564
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,539
but slew his son.

565
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,299
Wow.

566
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,059
No doubt when you look at the influence of Jehoiada

567
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,939
in the life of Joash and you understand

568
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:04,059
the text of scripture and that closeness

569
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,939
of the relationship, there's no doubt

570
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:10,339
that there would be some knowledge of Joash and Zechariah

571
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:14,499
and yet as Zechariah stood proclaiming truth,

572
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,039
Joash had him stoned.

573
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,979
Wow, influence.

574
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,999
I mean, quick, influence.

575
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,139
There's a slippery slope of sin.

576
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:31,539
Sometimes we can get on that slippery slope

577
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:32,899
and you think you can control it

578
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:36,099
and all of a sudden, things are out of control.

579
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,519
Chaos.

580
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,719
How did we get here?

581
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,899
We find this evening that we must be careful

582
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:42,779
of who influences you.

583
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,799
Number four, if you're taking notes,

584
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,979
I want you to rejoice in this, God is faithful.

585
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,539
God is faithful.

586
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,459
Notice what happens after the death of Jehoiada

587
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,899
and Joash has this influence of these princes of Judah

588
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:58,459
that come and they make obeisance to him.

589
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,339
I want you to notice in verse number 19,

590
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,339
the Bible says, yet he, that he is speaking of God,

591
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:08,339
sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the Lord

592
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,659
and they testified against them but they would not give ear.

593
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,819
This evening, we must rejoice in the fact

594
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,219
that God is faithful.

595
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,279
I'm thankful this evening that God pursues us.

596
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,699
I'm thankful this evening that if we get

597
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,259
a little sideways in our life,

598
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,819
if we get something that kinda just isn't going

599
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:27,699
the way it's supposed to go,

600
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,799
maybe we're struggling in our spiritual life

601
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,259
that God will use someone or something

602
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,299
to bring us back into fellowship with him.

603
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,339
God is faithful.

604
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,499
And we find this evening that God sent these prophets

605
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,819
and what a blessing to consider the grace

606
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,419
and the mercy of our God and to think about

607
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,979
how he pursues his people.

608
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,939
I'm thankful the Bible reveals to us

609
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:57,139
that Jesus in the gospels, that he is a seeking savior,

610
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,179
that he came to seek and to save that which was lost.

611
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,139
I'm thankful this evening.

612
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,719
Listen, there's been a time in your life,

613
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,779
there's been a time in my life where spiritually

614
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,979
we weren't like on the mountaintop, amen?

615
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:11,259
Sometimes in your life, you kinda have

616
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,979
that valley experience, so to speak,

617
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:17,659
and I'm thankful that God is faithful on the mountaintop

618
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,779
and I'm thankful that God is faithful in the valley.

619
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:24,499
And I'm thankful this evening that God will use people.

620
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,699
He'll use his people, he'll send, why?

621
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,539
Because he's faithful, he'll use his word.

622
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,439
Have you ever been ministered to by the word of God?

623
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,939
Man, you're going through a time in your life,

624
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,779
maybe you're struggling, maybe you're just kinda

625
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,419
just spinning your wheels, so to speak,

626
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:40,259
floundering around spiritually,

627
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,579
maybe there's some backsliding that's taking place

628
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:47,579
and God will use his word in our lives.

629
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,859
And I'm thankful this evening that God is faithful.

630
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,579
The Bible teaches us as we look at the truth

631
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,139
of chastening and how God seeks

632
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:59,579
and how God disciplines his children, why?

633
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,859
Because he loves us, because he loves us.

634
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:07,099
It's amazing to me when the Bible tells us

635
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,799
as you look over in the book of James,

636
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,659
look at James quickly with me,

637
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,139
and I want you to see this wonderful truth

638
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,099
in James chapter number four.

639
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,379
The thing about the faithfulness of God

640
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,379
and how he pursues us, and you understand this evening

641
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,299
that God desires to have close fellowship

642
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,639
with you as his child.

643
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,859
The Bible says in his presence is fullness of joy.

644
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:35,819
I'm thankful that God lets us enter into his presence.

645
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,619
He allows it.

646
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,939
I believe that God, he inhabits the praise of his people.

647
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:46,259
God loves when we are in fellowship with him

648
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:49,219
and when we're seeking to draw nigh unto him.

649
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:51,859
And the Bible says this in James four and verse number seven,

650
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,019
submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil,

651
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,219
and he will flee from you.

652
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,899
Notice this, draw nigh to God, and notice what it says,

653
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,679
and he will draw nigh to you.

654
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:05,159
That's a beautiful, beautiful verse of scripture.

655
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,439
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.

656
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:09,719
Cleanse your hands, you sinners,

657
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,679
and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

658
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,859
And so we find that we are to submit ourselves to God,

659
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,879
resist the devil, and we're to draw nigh to God

660
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,079
and understand that he'll draw nigh to us.

661
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,839
I'm thankful that God is faithful.

662
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,159
We mentioned in Sunday school this morning

663
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,719
the life of Samuel, how God does not force his people

664
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,319
to take heed to the warnings that he gives,

665
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,879
but God is faithful to give the warnings.

666
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,479
God is faithful to pursue his people.

667
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:42,559
Number five, I would say this,

668
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,559
determined to remain sensitive to God's word.

669
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:50,259
Determined to remain sensitive to God's word.

670
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,759
This evening, I'm thankful,

671
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,919
I said at the beginning of the message,

672
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,039
one of the first statements I made

673
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,319
is I'm thankful for God's word.

674
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,019
If we're not careful, we can have a hard heart

675
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,419
towards God's word.

676
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,879
We can become calloused.

677
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,239
We can become indifferent.

678
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,099
But we must endeavor and ask the Lord to help us

679
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,679
to have hearts that are sensitive.

680
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,859
Hearts that are soft, tender.

681
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:22,319
The Bible speaks about Josiah, how he had a tender heart.

682
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,979
And this evening, when we look at this portion of Scripture

683
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,479
and we understand the importance of remaining sensitive

684
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,659
to the word of God, the Bible says in verse number 19

685
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,039
that he, God, sent mess, prophets to them

686
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,579
to bring them again unto the Lord,

687
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:36,979
and they testified against them,

688
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,579
but they would not give ear.

689
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,579
And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah,

690
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,779
the son of Jehoiada, the priest,

691
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,699
which stood above the people and said unto them,

692
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,499
thus saith God, why transgress ye the commandments

693
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,339
of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper?

694
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,859
Because ye have forsaken the Lord,

695
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,419
he hath also forsaken you.

696
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,139
You find that in the end of verse number 19,

697
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,639
notice what the Bible says, but they would not give ear.

698
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,819
The Bible says in verse number 20

699
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:03,899
that they have forsaken the Lord.

700
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,139
This is why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord.

701
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:09,819
He says that ye cannot prosper.

702
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:12,299
And we find that as we understand the importance

703
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,419
this evening of us remaining sensitive to God's word,

704
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,799
that God will use his word in our lives.

705
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,339
But I must be sensitive to it.

706
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,579
I must be willing to allow God's word

707
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,299
to chart the course for my life.

708
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,059
I must be willing to come to a place

709
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:31,619
where I'm going to agree with God,

710
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,059
that what God said settles it,

711
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,979
that what God said is true,

712
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,419
that we come to a place where you say,

713
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,339
listen, here's what God says,

714
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:45,459
and if God confronts me as I read his word,

715
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,380
as his word is preached and taught,

716
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,399
as God uses his word in your life and in my life,

717
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,219
as God confronts us, hey, listen,

718
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:53,459
you better stop doing that

719
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:54,819
because it doesn't please the Lord,

720
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,739
I remain sensitive to God's word.

721
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:00,739
When God says you better start doing this

722
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,380
because this is what pleases me and I'm not doing it,

723
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,539
then I remain sensitive to God's word.

724
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,659
I want you to note the contrast in our text of scripture

725
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,099
between verse six and verse number 19.

726
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,819
In verse number six, Jehoiada is still alive,

727
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,459
and the Bible tells us this in verse number six.

728
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,699
It says in the king, that's Joash,

729
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,679
he called for Jehoiada the chief.

730
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:23,339
And notice what he says to him,

731
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:25,819
why hast thou not required the Levites

732
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,059
to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem,

733
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,279
the collection.

734
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,539
Notice what he says, according to the commandment of Moses,

735
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,500
the servant of the Lord.

736
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,099
Guess what he's referring to?

737
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:41,019
He's referring to the law.

738
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,419
He's referring to the written word of God.

739
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:47,659
And we find here that he's saying to Jehoiada,

740
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:50,539
that the basis of us making this collection

741
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,299
of going out to Judah and to Jerusalem

742
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,899
to bring in this collection

743
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,099
is in obedience to what God has said.

744
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:07,259
And yet we find that in verse number 19, as the prophets of God stand before Him and testify

745
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:10,699
against them, that they would not give ear.

746
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,579
Isn't that frightening?

747
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,339
I mean, honestly, when you read this, and you say, listen, I don't want to come to a

748
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,659
place where I'm hard-hearted.

749
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,859
I don't want to get to a place where I'm calloused to God's Word.

750
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,979
I don't want to get to a place where I feel like I got it figured out, I know it, and

751
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,219
I just kind of coast.

752
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:37,819
No, I want to remain sensitive to the leadership of God in my life, and He uses His Word.

753
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:42,779
And this evening, as we look at the life of Joash, we say, how in the world was he so

754
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,619
sensitive to wanting to obey?

755
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,099
Jehoiada is there.

756
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:50,539
Jehoiada has some influence, and he's saying we want to obey.

757
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,219
But then there's some princes of Judah that come along.

758
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,179
And by the way, those that would come along that would seek to influence you to go away

759
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:03,659
from what you've been taught, from the ways of the Lord, they're not good influences.

760
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,979
The Bible says that he then, as he hears the prophets that God so graciously and mercifully

761
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:13,939
sent them, that they would not give ear.

762
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:18,899
So much so that Zechariah comes, filled with the Spirit of God, delivers a message, and

763
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,619
they stone him.

764
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:23,699
Wow.

765
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:30,859
It's amazing.

766
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:37,739
As we look to God's Word, how we can have such mixed responses to God's Word from time

767
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:42,659
to time in our lives.

768
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,379
I've been here for 12 years and a week.

769
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:52,459
I don't think anyone here would know who the individual is, but just in case they did,

770
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:55,299
I won't say the name.

771
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:01,139
Years and years and years ago, just shortly after we got here, somebody would say to me

772
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:04,899
regularly, oh, that's the best message I ever heard.

773
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,659
Oh, man, thank you for preaching God's Word.

774
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:09,979
They say it week after week.

775
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:18,059
And then all of a sudden, there was a message that kind of hit home more, and it wasn't

776
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:23,179
so much a response of, man, I'm glad for that message, it was good that so-and-so was here

777
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:25,099
to hear that.

778
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,659
It was, I'm not coming back here anymore.

779
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:35,379
And I kind of scratched my head, and I thought, how for so many weeks could it be, that was

780
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:37,259
the best message I've ever heard?

781
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:43,059
Now, understand, I don't really take that personally, because I know better, all right?

782
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:50,659
But what I'm saying is, how can somebody's response be so sensitive, but then God's Word

783
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,499
confronts them personally on something, and there's a wall that comes up, and it's, nope,

784
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,859
I don't want that anymore.

785
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:01,379
It's sad, but it happens.

786
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:06,259
If we're not careful, we can get a hard heart.

787
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:14,299
We must determine to stay sensitive, remain sensitive to God's Word.

788
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,379
People are going to try to tell you God's Word isn't true.

789
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:23,259
I said this, I know Breonna's going to Bible college, I've said this over the years, one

790
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:29,179
of the best places, I use the word best, not in a good sense, but one of the easiest, maybe

791
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,419
that's a better word, places to get backslidden is Bible college.

792
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,599
I've been in Bible college.

793
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,879
I believe I can say that, because what happens so often in Bible college, this becomes a

794
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:44,059
textbook.

795
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,059
It does.

796
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:51,559
It becomes a textbook, instead of the living Word of God, the written Word of God.

797
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:59,439
And we find that sometimes we begin reading portions of Scripture, I mean lengthy portions

798
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:03,439
of Scripture for an assignment, because it has to be done.

799
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,679
Oh, we want to be sensitive.

800
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,319
I don't ever want to look, listen, I determine, I don't look at the Bible as a sermon book.

801
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,319
I don't.

802
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,599
I don't look at the Bible as a sermon book.

803
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,199
Can you preach sermons out of the Bible?

804
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,319
Absolutely.

805
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:27,279
But if I go to the Bible and just look for a sermon, it's terrible.

806
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:34,599
We go to the Bible as God's written Word, perfect preserved, and God ministers, and

807
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,679
God speaks to, and God helps and directs, and then God will help us to have sermons

808
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,639
to preach, messages to deliver.

809
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,759
We must remain sensitive to God's Word.

810
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:55,939
Number six, I would say this as we close out the chapter, disobedience leads to judgment.

811
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:57,819
Disobedience leads to judgment.

812
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,859
You will not be the exception.

813
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:07,079
I preached from Genesis 38 last Sunday evening and preached a very similar thought on one

814
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,579
of the points.

815
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:15,939
It is a biblical principle that disobedience leads to judgment.

816
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:19,019
God is just.

817
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,379
He's a righteous judge.

818
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:24,539
I am so thankful that He's gracious, and He's merciful, and He's long-suffering, and we

819
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,419
could go on and on on all the attributes of God.

820
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:34,579
Unfortunately, there are times in people's lives that they are experiencing the long-suffering

821
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:39,899
of God, the grace and the mercy of God, and unfortunately, they mistake that for being

822
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:44,259
God's approval of their disobedience.

823
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:47,419
But God never approves disobedience.

824
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:53,819
God is never approving disobedience, and we find here that as we look at this text of

825
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:59,259
Scripture, notice the Bible says that they testified against them in verse number 19.

826
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,699
In verse number 20, the Bible says that you cannot prosper.

827
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:09,339
The Bible tells us in verse number 18 that when they did these trespasses and all that

828
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:13,899
was taking place and how God, it says, and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem.

829
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:14,899
Why?

830
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:15,899
For this, their trespass.

831
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:18,819
But look specifically, if you will, at verse number 23.

832
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:24,579
The Bible says, and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of Syria came

833
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:29,339
up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of

834
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:34,259
the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.

835
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:38,779
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very

836
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:43,559
great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

837
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,339
So they executed judgment against Joash.

838
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:50,779
I want you to look at verse 24, and I want you to get something tonight from verse 24.

839
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:53,659
How many of you know the story of Gideon, the account of Gideon?

840
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:54,659
Right?

841
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,579
Lydia, how many men did Gideon have?

842
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,579
300.

843
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,579
Right?

844
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:04,579
The Midianites, thousands, multitude, right?

845
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,259
Who got the victory?

846
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:07,859
Gideon.

847
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,379
Why?

848
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,899
God.

849
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:12,499
In one word, God.

850
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:15,579
Why did God tell Gideon that his army was too big?

851
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,659
If I give you the victory with that many people, you're going to say that you got the victory.

852
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:25,699
I mean, is that basically, we don't have to turn to the judges, we're good, right?

853
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:27,059
You're tracking.

854
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:31,099
Look at verse 25, or 24 again with me.

855
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,179
For the army of the Syrians came with a, what's the Bible say?

856
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:39,479
A small company of men.

857
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:42,179
A small company of men.

858
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:47,059
Here's what it says, and the Lord delivered a, what's it say?

859
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:51,419
A very great host into their hand.

860
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,019
Who's their hand?

861
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:55,779
That's the Syrians, right?

862
00:37:55,779 --> 00:38:04,419
So God delivered his people, a great number of them, into the hands of the Syrians, who

863
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:07,499
only had a small company.

864
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:10,979
We like talking about Gideon better, don't we?

865
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:14,339
It's easier to preach about Gideon too, because it's exciting.

866
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,339
Why?

867
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:19,659
Because God used a small group of his people to deliver them from the oppression of the

868
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,339
enemy.

869
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:27,019
But here the Bible says that God, he tells us here that there was a small company of

870
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:32,579
men and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand.

871
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:41,899
Notice what the next words say, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

872
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:45,099
Wow.

873
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:49,779
That's impactful.

874
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:53,819
They come to Jeremiah, is God going to fight for us?

875
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,619
Jeremiah says God's going to fight against you.

876
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,899
You say, well, that's exciting.

877
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:04,539
Here's where it comes.

878
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:08,299
Disobedience leads to judgment.

879
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:14,339
Verse 25, when they departed from him, for they left him in great diseases, his own servants

880
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,299
conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada, the priest, and slew him

881
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:20,579
on his bed, and he died.

882
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,500
They buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the

883
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,899
kings.

884
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:30,859
And these are they that had conspired against him, Zabad the son of Shimeath, and Ammonitus,

885
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:34,899
and Jehozabad the son of Shemrith ate Moabitus.

886
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:38,979
Now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing

887
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:42,099
of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings.

888
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:48,359
And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

889
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:54,579
As we look at these 27 verses in 2 Chronicles chapter 24, I believe God lets us learn some

890
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,940
lessons.

891
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
As we look at these 27 verses in 2 Chronicles chapter 24, I believe God lets us learn some

892
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:58,940


893
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,380
mentors. Recognize the importance of spiritual mentors in your life for all

894
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:12,980
of us. Be accountable to them. Understand the importance of developing a personal

895
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:20,260
walk with the Lord. Every day I need to work to develop my personal walk with

896
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:29,100
God. Every single day I need to be mindful of what am I doing today to draw

897
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,740
closer to God. Be careful who influences you. Before you start jumping on that

898
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,780
social media and getting on this one and that one and so on and so forth, before

899
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,260
you start joining that group of friends and listening to, oh but they said this

900
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,620
and they said that, these princes of Judah gave obeisance to the king. Before

901
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,900
long he left the house of God and he was serving groves and idols. And then he

902
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,660
killed the son of the one that was his spiritual mentor, Zechariah. Be careful

903
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:09,860
who influences you. It's tragedy. God is faithful. Aren't you so thankful for that?

904
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,900
I'm thankful that our God is faithful. Faithful is he that calleth you who also

905
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,660
will do it. We sing about great is thy faithfulness. God is faithful. I'm

906
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,940
thankful that he pursues his people. He gives us opportunity. He raised up these

907
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,180
prophets. He sent these messengers. Oh that God would help us to be sensitive

908
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,540
to his word. Every day in our lives, God help me to be sensitive. Help me not to

909
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,700
have a hard heart. Help me not to get calloused. Help me not to just, I got this.

910
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,500
I got it all figured out. And oh we must understand that disobedience leads to

911
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:53,020
judgment. I'm thankful that God's gracious and he's merciful and he forgives.

912
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,900
But understand that disobedience leads to judgment. Our God is just. He's a

913
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,860
righteous judge. Judgment doesn't always come immediately. The harvest is not

914
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:13,740
immediate. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever man soweth, that shall

915
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,779
he also reap. That truth in the book of Galatians in the sixth chapter is

916
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:23,260
positive and negative. You sow good seeds, you get good crop. You sow bad seeds,

917
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:29,059
not so much. This evening, we learned some lessons from the life of Joash.

918
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:32,300
Not only for these young ladies that are getting ready to go to college, but really

919
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,380
for all of us. Some lessons from the life of Joash. Let's pray together. Father, we

920
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,580
love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your word, the truth that's

921
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,779
contained therein. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to take heed to these

922
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:53,500
lessons as we can stand and look at this portion of scripture and see in a life

923
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:01,979
such a contrast between the time in which Jehoiada is alive and then after his death.

924
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,900
God, I pray that we would learn these lessons that would apply truth in our

925
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,300
lives. You'd help us, Lord, to be doers of thy word. Help us as we respond now in

926
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,779
this time of invitation. Would you have your will in way? For it's in Christ's name we pray.
