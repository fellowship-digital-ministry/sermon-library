00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Chronicles chapter 24 this evening,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.039
2 Chronicles chapter number 24,

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:07.199
and I'm thankful for God's word,

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:10.960
I'm thankful for the truth that is contained therein.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.840
The Bible says that all scripture

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.880
is given by inspiration of God,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.920
and it says this, that it's profitable for us,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.719
and I'm thankful that God's word

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.680
has been given by inspiration,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.719
it's been divinely preserved for us today,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.739
we can have confidence in what we hold in our hands

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.959
as being the complete canon of scripture,

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:33.139
and we can find that as God has recorded

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:35.459
what he has chosen to record for us,

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:37.900
that it's for our benefit, it is to help us,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.180
it is profitable for us,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.540
as we look at 2 Chronicles chapter 24 this evening,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.080
I'm trusting that God will allow me

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.240
to extract some lessons from this text of scripture

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.020
as we read and study part of the life of Joash

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.259
as it's recorded here in 2 Chronicles chapter 24,

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:00.580
and I hope that it would be a blessing to us

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.159
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.800
obviously this evening we have the Farewell Fellowship

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.400
for Kid Emei and for Brianna,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.900
and they're going to be heading off to college,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480
Kid Emei leaves on Thursday,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.800
and then Brianna leaves on the 29th of August,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.959
and so some of these lessons here,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.779
specifically in mind for these two young ladies

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.160
that are heading off to college,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.639
everyone else gets to participate this evening,

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.620
and we get to hear these lessons,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.900
but just six thoughts tonight,

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:29.879
so I'll try to go pretty quickly

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.919
and then get into the remainder of the service this evening,

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.139
but notice in verse number one,

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.980
the Bible says this,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.839
Joash was seven years old when it began to rain,

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:40.599
and it rained 40 years in Jerusalem,

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.599
his mother's name also was Zebiah of Beersheba,

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.559
and Joash, notice the Bible says that he did that

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:50.919
which was right in the sight of the Lord,

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:55.919
but it says this, all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.599
and the next several verses of scripture

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.580
in the text of scripture will provide us

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.639
with some of the actions that take place

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.860
and there under the beginning of the rain

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.179
of Joash as being king,

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.339
we find that the Bible tells us in verse number 15,

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.419
but Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died,

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.619
and 130 years old was he when he died,

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.940
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.580
because he had done good in Israel,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.639
both toward God and toward his house,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.440
Jehoiada was a man that served God faithfully,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.880
we find that he had influence on the life of Joash,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.240
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720
we're gonna look at the whole chapter

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880
and just seek to extract some lessons

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.880
that I hope would be applicable for each of us this evening

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.800
as we look at this portion of scripture

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.199
and seek to glean principles

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.220
that would guide us in our living,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.399
number one, if you're taking notes this evening,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.360
I want you to consider with me the importance

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.520
of having a spiritual mentor in your life,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.820
the importance of having a spiritual mentor in your life,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.139
and I would say this, and to be accountable,

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.660
accountability is something

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.699
that's missing in our society today,

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:07.740
in fact, a lot of people

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.339
don't wanna be accountable to anyone,

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.580
a lot of people don't wanna be accountable,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.020
if you read the book of Romans in the first chapter,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.339
they deny the existence of God simply

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.580
because they don't wanna be accountable to God,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.419
and we live in a time and an era

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.300
in this particular day that we're living in

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.380
where people simply don't wanna be accountable,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.080
but I believe this evening that it's important

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.479
that we recognize that it's vital

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.679
that we have spiritual mentors in our lives,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.800
now as young people, as I would think about

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.520
giving this message to Brianna and to Kiademe

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.720
as they head off to college,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.639
obviously this new phase of life for them,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.160
but for each of us this evening,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.240
we understand the importance

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.479
of having spiritual mentors in our lives,

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.360
in fact, at some point in our lives,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440
we would trust that as the cycle of life would go forward,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.940
that we would become a spiritual mentor

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.779
in someone else's life,

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.259
but even at that point, it's important

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.479
that we still continue to have mentors in our own life,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.320
and that we have people that we're able to counsel with,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.539
I'm thankful that God's word gives counsel,

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.179
I'm thankful for the truth that's contained therein,

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.039
but God told us within the pages of his word

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.660
that there's safety in the multitude of counselors,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.859
and so we find that God has provided for us,

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.380
I still have in my life,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.040
I have men that I will pick up the phone,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.119
and I will call that I refer to,

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:29.839
and I look to as being spiritual mentors in my life,

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.540
I've reached the age in my particular life and ministry,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.720
where now I receive the phone calls from younger preachers

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.679
that are saying, hey, I got this problem,

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.239
I got this situation,

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:43.619
and I begin to try to give them some biblical counsel,

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:45.000
when I think about Joash,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.519
and this understanding of the importance

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.640
of having a spiritual mentor,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.440
and obviously being accountable,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.619
we notice that the Bible says that Jehoiada here

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.220
had great influence in the life of Joash,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.980
so much so that the Bible says in verse number two

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.299
of our text that Joash did that which was right

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:02.459
in the sight of the Lord,

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:04.559
all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.779
it's kind of interesting,

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.899
as you study through the Kings and Chronicles,

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:09.899
as you have the opportunity to study

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.299
what God has recorded of their lives,

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:15.619
many times you will read where the Bible will speak about

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.500
all the days of their lives,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.640
but here specifically the Bible says that he did that

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.760
which was right in the sight of the Lord,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.440
all the days of Jehoiada the priest,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.320
there's a distinct difference in how God

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.739
gives us this truth,

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:36.720
how he articulates the life of Joash,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.040
and helps us to understand,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.119
and so we see the influence,

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.160
this spiritual mentorship, if you will,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.260
that Jehoiada had in the life of Joash,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.399
we read again, notice in verse number six,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.859
we'll keep reading in verse number three,

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:52.500
and Jehoiada took for him two wives,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.619
and begat sons and daughters,

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.299
and it came to pass after this,

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.140
that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.380
that's a good thing,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.760
and the Bible says in verse number five

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.700
that he gathered together the priests and the Levites,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.619
and said to them,

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.339
go out unto the cities of Judah,

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.160
and gather of all Israel money

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.779
to repair the house of your God,

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:09.660
from year to year,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.779
and see that ye hasten the matter,

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.660
how be it the Levites hastened it not,

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:19.119
and again, Joash had good intentions here,

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.640
it was a good thing to repair the house of the Lord,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.140
he says let's do it with haste,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.320
the Levites however hastened not,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.799
notice in verse number six,

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:30.079
the Bible says the king called for who,

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:32.119
he called for Jehoiada the chief,

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:33.799
there was a relationship there,

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:35.959
between Jehoiada and Joash,

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.200
and he calls for Jehoiada the chief,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.519
and notice when he says to him,

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.160
why hast thou not required of the Levites

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.440
to bring in out of Judah,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.359
and out of Jerusalem the collection,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.859
according to the commandment of Moses,

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:48.220
the servant of the Lord,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.579
and of the congregation of Israel,

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.179
for the tabernacle of witness,

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:53.100
if you were to skip down,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.200
and look at verse 12 and 14 with me,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.179
I want you to notice again,

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:57.380
there's a phrase that's mentioned,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.459
that I think gives us some insight,

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:00.859
with regard to the relationship,

00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:03.579
between Joash and Jehoiada,

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:04.700
notice in verse number 12,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.679
the Bible says and the king and Jehoiada,

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:09.260
it says it again in verse number 14,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.100
in the middle of the verse,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.339
the king and Jehoiada,

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:12.179
notice in verse number 12,

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:13.459
it says and the king and Jehoiada,

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:15.339
gave it to such as did,

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:17.119
the work of the service of the house of the Lord,

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:18.720
and hired masons and carpenters,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.299
to repair the house of the Lord,

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.420
and also such as wrought iron and brass,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.519
and to mend the house of the Lord,

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.200
gave what gave that offering,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.600
that he was speaking of,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.160
in verses five and six,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.440
we find that the Bible tells us,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440
that the workmen wrought,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.320
in verse number 13,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.679
the work was perfected by them,

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:38.720
they set the house of God in a state,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.160
and strengthened it,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.399
and when they had finished it,

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.720
they brought the rest of the money,

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:44.779
before the king and Jehoiada,

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.940
again, I mentioned verse 12 and 14,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.119
use that phraseology,

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:48.959
the king and Jehoiada,

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.500
again seeing the relationship,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.059
whereof were made vessels,

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:52.940
for the house of the Lord,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.459
even vessels to minister,

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:56.220
and to offer with all in spoons,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.820
and vessels of gold and silver,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.299
and they offered burnt offerings,

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.299
in the house of the Lord continually,

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:02.260
notice it says again,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.260
all the days of Jehoiada,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.019
it's interesting that Joash is the king,

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.019
but this is the second time,

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.779
that we read about all the days of Jehoiada,

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.700
and we find here,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.399
that Jehoiada had an impact,

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.239
and influence,

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:17.040
he had this role of being a spiritual mentor,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.359
in the life of Joash,

00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:19.760
it's vital,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.040
it is absolutely essential,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.000
that we have a spiritual mentor in our lives,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.519
somebody that we can look to,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.079
that we can counsel with,

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:30.399
that we can understand,

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.519
that there's safety,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.840
as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.659
and the multitude of counselors,

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.960
the Bible speaks obviously,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.039
as you look at the New Testament,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.159
you think about the role of the Apostle Paul,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.520
the Apostle Paul was a man,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.979
that sought the face of God,

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:44.739
he was a man that followed the Lord,

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:47.219
and he says to those that he's ministering to,

00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:49.559
he says be followers of me,

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.539
as I follow the Lord,

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.859
and we find that Paul was a man,

00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:54.940
as we look at his life,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.719
that he had the opportunity,

00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:57.919
the role that he played,

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.940
in the lives of Timothy and Titus,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.700
he speaks about them as being,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.320
his sons in the faith,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.419
but we understand that he had a spiritual mentorship,

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:07.700
in their lives,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.299
in fact we find that Paul,

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.859
very carefully in the book of 1st and 2nd Timothy,

00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:13.099
in the book of Titus,

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:15.659
gives them the instruction with regard,

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.320
to following the example that he set forth,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.760
this evening we see first of all,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.900
number lesson number one,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.020
from this portion of scripture,

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.619
the importance of having a spiritual mentor,

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:26.780
in our lives,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.340
and the importance of being accountable,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.580
spiritual mentors are designed to help us,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.780
in our spiritual journey,

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:35.140
spiritual mentor,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.580
you think about accountability,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.859
and the truth of being accountable,

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.299
someone made this distinction,

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:42.840
to seek counsel,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.340
is to get answers to your questions,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.599
to be accountable,

00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:49.799
is to give answers to the questions asked,

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.820
I think that's a very minor distinction,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.059
but listen to it again,

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.739
to seek counsel,

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.219
is to get answers to your questions,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.979
lots of people seek counsel.

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.959
They want answers to their questions.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:05.379
To be accountable is to give answers

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.759
to the questions that are asked.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.519
How are you doing spiritually?

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:11.399
How's your walk with God?

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.879
How's your prayer life?

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.679
How's your Bible reading?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.799
That's being accountable.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:18.279
Spiritually, spiritual mentorship,

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.519
asking those questions.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.119
Listen, a lot of times,

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:23.479
I mentioned this a few weeks ago on a Sunday morning,

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:25.599
a lot of times we don't ask those kind of questions.

00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:29.159
We kind of almost act like that's a part of our lives

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:31.799
that we don't deal with, that we don't really focus on,

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.199
but it ought to be that we have

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:36.479
some spiritual accountability to those

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:37.879
that would be our spiritual mentors.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:40.159
Number two, lesson number two.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:41.359
I would say this.

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:42.839
As we look at the life of Joash,

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.759
we see very obviously in the text of Scripture

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.759
the importance of developing a personal walk with God.

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:52.699
We could never overemphasize this evening

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.839
the importance of a personal walk with the Lord.

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.999
We need to develop that personally.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:00.559
Listen, someone said years ago,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:03.439
a preacher of yesteryear, God has no grandchildren.

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:04.279
What does he mean by that?

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:06.839
Well, we're all sons and daughters of the Lord.

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.959
He has no grandkids.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.519
If you are saved, if you're heaven-bound,

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.999
it's because you trust that Christ is your Savior,

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:16.199
and he adopted you into his family,

00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:18.119
and he says, behold, what manner of love

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:19.639
the Father hath bestowed upon us

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:22.319
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:25.559
What a wonderful truth that God gives us in his word,

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.439
and we understand that as we seek

00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:30.239
to develop this personal walk with God

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:32.959
that the importance of it,

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.719
and we understand that it's not just the God of my mentor,

00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:38.719
it's not just the God of my parents,

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:42.159
it's not just the God of the pastor, but it's my God.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.759
It's a personal thing.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:46.239
We find here, I want you to see in the text of Scripture,

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.679
I read verse number 15 by way of introduction,

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.899
but we find this.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:54.899
At some point, a spiritual mentor will pass into eternity.

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:59.279
And then what happens with our own personal walk with God?

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:03.319
In the life of Joash, it's terrible what happens.

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:06.159
The contrast between the first 16 verses

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.839
of 2 Chronicles 24, and then from verse 17 to 27,

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:14.319
that last portion, it's absolutely mind-boggling

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:17.839
as you look at the contrast in these portions of Scripture,

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:18.839
but what changed?

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:20.359
Well, the Bible says in verse 15,

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:24.559
but Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:29.519
He was 130 years old, and that's when he died,

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:34.039
and we find that this was a very important turning point

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.439
in the life of Joash.

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:37.439
In fact, the Bible says in verse 17,

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:39.639
now after the death of Jehoiada,

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:42.639
and we're gonna notice in just a moment what takes place,

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.919
but I ask this question,

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.799
how do we develop a personal walk with God?

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.919
It's good that the preacher can stand up and say,

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.039
hey, listen, it's important

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.799
that you have a personal walk with God.

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:53.539
How do I develop that personal walk with God?

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.479
What is it that I do?

00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:57.319
Why should I develop a personal walk with God?

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:00.039
And the reality is that as we look at God's word

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:02.559
and we understand the truth of salvation

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:05.159
and we understand being adopted in the family of God,

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:10.159
we should have a desire to know him personally.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.759
I don't wanna, I said this morning,

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:15.079
I don't wanna just hear from somebody else

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:15.999
what God is doing.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:18.959
I wanna personally experience the greatness of God.

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.479
It's not enough to just know about God.

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:25.879
We see as what Paul said in the book of Philippians,

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.559
that I may know him.

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:31.119
And having that intimate fellowship

00:13:31.119 --> 00:13:33.239
and that walk with the Lord.

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:34.639
We do not walk with the Lord.

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.419
We don't seek to develop a walk with the Lord

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:38.279
so that we can maintain our salvation.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:41.079
We know that that's not the biblically accurate

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:42.219
or biblically true.

00:13:42.219 --> 00:13:44.799
We seek to walk with the Lord daily.

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:46.559
We sang this morning, trust and obey.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.599
And we think about the walking

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:50.799
and that daily walking with the Lord.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:53.639
And we find that the Bible gives us so much insight

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:55.879
as we seek the face of God.

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.719
I hope this morning, this evening,

00:13:57.719 --> 00:13:59.279
as we consider our walk with God

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.919
and developing our walk with God,

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:02.479
that we're working on it.

00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:04.319
That we're seeking to be closer to God today

00:14:04.319 --> 00:14:05.759
than we were yesterday,

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:09.799
than we were a month ago, a year ago, five years ago.

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:12.199
Because that closeness with God,

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:15.159
that drawing nigh unto the Lord,

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:18.559
drawing near to God is so vital

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.199
for our spiritual journey as we go through life.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:23.039
Why?

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.959
Because we have an enemy.

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:27.359
And the enemy wants to devour us and destroy us.

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:31.119
And we find this evening that it's absolutely essential

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:32.919
that we would understand the importance

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:35.539
that yes, we have a spiritual mentor,

00:14:35.539 --> 00:14:37.759
but we can't just ride the coattails

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:39.199
of our spiritual mentor.

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:42.199
We must develop a personal walk with God.

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:45.679
At some point in life,

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:47.719
you want to teach your children

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:49.759
how to live life on their own.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.959
You teach them how to,

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.659
you know, there's a time in parenting

00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:56.639
that you spoon feed your children.

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.059
Y'all understand what I mean when I say that.

00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:00.919
When you do the little thing as,

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:03.119
you know, they don't want to eat the broccoli

00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:05.679
and you're trying to act like it's an airplane

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:07.359
and you're doing all this kind of nonsense

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:08.919
to get them to eat the broccoli

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:11.239
and you're trying to make it palatable for them

00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:12.399
and so on and so forth.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.239
But at some point,

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:15.439
you want them to be able to feed themselves.

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:18.639
And this evening,

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:22.239
we understand the importance of the mentor,

00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:23.699
but we understand this evening

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:24.999
that it's absolutely essential

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:27.679
that we develop a personal walk with God.

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.879
When I think about the role of a pastor

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:34.839
and also as a parent, a spiritual leader,

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:37.039
we understand the Bible tells me as a pastor

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:39.239
that I'm to feed the flock of God.

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.639
That's a biblical responsibility that I have

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.399
is to feed the flock of God.

00:15:44.119 --> 00:15:44.959
But you know,

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.079
if the only time the flock of God gets fed

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.039
is when the pastor stands up and preaches a message,

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:52.279
the flock of God is going to be anemic,

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:55.639
malnourished.

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.479
It's just true.

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.239
It's the way it works.

00:15:58.239 --> 00:16:02.079
If the only time the flock of God is being fed,

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:06.199
no, so the pastor, yes, is to feed.

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.559
That's a job, a role,

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:10.099
that's a responsibility that the pastor has,

00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:12.479
but the flock needs to learn how to feast

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:14.959
on God's word themselves.

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:17.319
Study to show thyself approved unto God,

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:18.999
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:22.119
rightly dividing the word of truth.

00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:24.559
As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word,

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:26.599
that ye may grow thereby.

00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:28.159
But grow in grace and knowledge

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.719
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:32.199
And we find that all of these truths are given to us,

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:35.199
and so the focus on the importance

00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:37.259
of developing that personal walk with God,

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:38.279
it's something we have to work on.

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.999
It's not gonna happen by accident.

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:45.279
Number three, lessons from the life of Joash.

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:48.099
Number three, be careful who influences you.

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:50.899
Somebody's trying to influence you.

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:52.599
Somebody's trying to influence me.

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:56.879
And we need to be careful of the tactics

00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:00.039
and the approaches of those that would seek to influence us.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.639
As we look at this text of scripture,

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:05.079
and we come, verse 15 speaks of the death of Jehoiada.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.879
Verse 16, the burial of Jehoiada.

00:17:06.879 --> 00:17:08.679
But we come to verse 17, and the Bible says,

00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:11.499
now, after the death of Jehoiada,

00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:14.759
notice what the Bible says, came the princes of Judah.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.199
Notice what they do.

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:18.999
They made obeisance to the king.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:23.119
Then the king hearkened unto them.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.859
Someone's trying to influence you.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.199
Someone's trying to influence me.

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:30.319
So often we think about the truth of influence,

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.959
we think about young people,

00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:33.439
and certainly that's a big truth

00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:36.599
and a big important recognition that we have

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.479
that someone's trying to influence our young people.

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:42.359
But I want you to know that as adults, senior saints,

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.479
somebody's trying to influence you.

00:17:44.479 --> 00:17:47.719
Listen, we need to be careful who influences us.

00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:48.959
You know what's amazing today?

00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:50.919
It used to be that we could really limit

00:17:50.919 --> 00:17:53.459
those who influenced us because we didn't have

00:17:53.459 --> 00:17:55.959
so many things available at the touch of a button.

00:17:56.879 --> 00:17:58.119
But I would say to you this evening

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.119
that we're being influenced by social media.

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:04.479
I don't have social media.

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.519
I hear a whole lot about social media.

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.759
I don't have it.

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:10.519
I'm not saying that I'm against it,

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:12.279
that I'm not preaching against it.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.759
I'm just saying we need to be careful.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:15.599
We need to be careful, why?

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:16.719
Because there's influence.

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:18.519
There's influence.

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.479
The books that we read, the things that we watch,

00:18:20.479 --> 00:18:22.599
the people that we run with, and so on and so forth.

00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:26.439
And notice how these individuals,

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:29.719
they really are using flattery.

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:32.359
The Bible says that they come and these princes of Judah,

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:35.500
they made obeisance to the king.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.919
They made obeisance to the king.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:37.959
And then the Bible says,

00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:41.839
then the king hearkened unto them.

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:43.479
Isn't that sad?

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:44.839
The Bible tells us in verse 18

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:47.599
that they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:49.479
and served groves and idols,

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:52.559
and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.199
for this their trespass.

00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:56.599
Now, I want you to understand

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.699
that while Jehoiada was still alive,

00:18:58.699 --> 00:19:02.039
that Joash was the one that commissioned,

00:19:02.719 --> 00:19:03.559
in verse number four,

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.519
the repair of the house of the Lord.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.579
He was the one that not only commissioned

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.779
the repair of the house of the Lord in verse number four,

00:19:09.779 --> 00:19:12.599
but he was the one that said, let's hasten the matter.

00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.919
He was the one that when they hastened not,

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:16.440
that he calls for Jehoiada and he says,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.959
hey, what's going on here?

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:20.820
Why aren't you making them do this?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.359
Then all of a sudden, Jehoiada dies.

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:25.959
These princes of Judah come and they make obeisance

00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:28.039
to the king and the king hearkens unto them.

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:31.599
They leave the house of the Lord, their God,

00:19:31.599 --> 00:19:35.239
and they go and they serve groves and idols.

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:37.760
Could scratch their head and say,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.440
how in the world does that happen?

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:47.599
Well, number one, there's a lack of a personal walk with God

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:51.119
in the life of Joash.

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.119
Influence is powerful.

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.839
Influence is powerful.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:59.599
People are seeking to influence us.

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.899
At times, we don't even know it.

00:20:03.959 --> 00:20:05.839
Have you ever heard something and you walked away?

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:08.159
This happened to both Holly and I just this past week.

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:10.359
We walked away and we said, I think that was good,

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:15.179
but I'm suspicious as to what the underlying message was.

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:16.719
You ever feel that way?

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:17.719
You hear something and you're like,

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:20.599
I think at the surface it sounds like it's okay,

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:25.439
but knowing the source, I think something,

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:27.119
what did I miss?

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.079
We both walked away from a situation with that same thought

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:38.559
and we have to be careful who we allow to influence us.

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.679
We speak about choosing our friends wisely.

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.719
Oh, how important that is.

00:20:43.719 --> 00:20:45.639
We live in a society today,

00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:48.679
how many friends are following somebody

00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:50.399
on some social media platform

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:54.799
and all of this important stuff of I have this

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.919
and I have that, so we gotta be careful.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:00.919
I remember years ago, someone said this to me,

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:04.799
it's better to have no friends than the wrong friends.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:08.839
Man, how important that is to understand that truth.

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:11.719
And we find this evening that we must be careful,

00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:14.279
lesson number three of who influences us.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:16.599
Jehoiada allowed for the princes of Judah

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:18.199
to have influence in his life

00:21:18.199 --> 00:21:20.399
and a man that was concerned about repairing

00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:22.839
the house of the Lord, a man that was hastening

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:24.399
the repair of the house of the Lord

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:26.299
now leaves the house of the Lord

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:29.239
and the Bible says they're serving groves and idols.

00:21:29.239 --> 00:21:30.779
It gets worse from there.

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:35.219
The Bible tells us in verse number 20 that Zechariah,

00:21:35.219 --> 00:21:36.899
the son of Jehoiada, the priest,

00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:39.179
came and stood and delivered a message

00:21:39.179 --> 00:21:41.779
and the Bible says that they conspired to kill him

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:42.979
and it says in verse 22,

00:21:42.979 --> 00:21:45.379
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:47.499
which Jehoiada, his father, had done to him

00:21:47.499 --> 00:21:49.539
but slew his son.

00:21:50.459 --> 00:21:51.299
Wow.

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:57.059
No doubt when you look at the influence of Jehoiada

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:59.939
in the life of Joash and you understand

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:04.059
the text of scripture and that closeness

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:05.939
of the relationship, there's no doubt

00:22:05.939 --> 00:22:10.339
that there would be some knowledge of Joash and Zechariah

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:14.499
and yet as Zechariah stood proclaiming truth,

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:17.039
Joash had him stoned.

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:20.979
Wow, influence.

00:22:20.979 --> 00:22:23.999
I mean, quick, influence.

00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:28.139
There's a slippery slope of sin.

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:31.539
Sometimes we can get on that slippery slope

00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:32.899
and you think you can control it

00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:36.099
and all of a sudden, things are out of control.

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:37.519
Chaos.

00:22:37.519 --> 00:22:38.719
How did we get here?

00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:41.899
We find this evening that we must be careful

00:22:41.899 --> 00:22:42.779
of who influences you.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.799
Number four, if you're taking notes,

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:47.979
I want you to rejoice in this, God is faithful.

00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:49.539
God is faithful.

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:52.459
Notice what happens after the death of Jehoiada

00:22:52.459 --> 00:22:55.899
and Joash has this influence of these princes of Judah

00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:58.459
that come and they make obeisance to him.

00:22:58.459 --> 00:23:00.339
I want you to notice in verse number 19,

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:03.339
the Bible says, yet he, that he is speaking of God,

00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:08.339
sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the Lord

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:12.659
and they testified against them but they would not give ear.

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:15.819
This evening, we must rejoice in the fact

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:17.219
that God is faithful.

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:20.279
I'm thankful this evening that God pursues us.

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:22.699
I'm thankful this evening that if we get

00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:24.259
a little sideways in our life,

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.819
if we get something that kinda just isn't going

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:27.699
the way it's supposed to go,

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:30.799
maybe we're struggling in our spiritual life

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:34.259
that God will use someone or something

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:37.299
to bring us back into fellowship with him.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:39.339
God is faithful.

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:42.499
And we find this evening that God sent these prophets

00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:44.819
and what a blessing to consider the grace

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:47.419
and the mercy of our God and to think about

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:50.979
how he pursues his people.

00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:52.939
I'm thankful the Bible reveals to us

00:23:52.939 --> 00:23:57.139
that Jesus in the gospels, that he is a seeking savior,

00:23:57.139 --> 00:24:00.179
that he came to seek and to save that which was lost.

00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:02.139
I'm thankful this evening.

00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:03.719
Listen, there's been a time in your life,

00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:05.779
there's been a time in my life where spiritually

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:08.979
we weren't like on the mountaintop, amen?

00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:11.259
Sometimes in your life, you kinda have

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:13.979
that valley experience, so to speak,

00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:17.659
and I'm thankful that God is faithful on the mountaintop

00:24:17.659 --> 00:24:20.779
and I'm thankful that God is faithful in the valley.

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:24.499
And I'm thankful this evening that God will use people.

00:24:24.499 --> 00:24:26.699
He'll use his people, he'll send, why?

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:29.539
Because he's faithful, he'll use his word.

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:32.439
Have you ever been ministered to by the word of God?

00:24:32.439 --> 00:24:33.939
Man, you're going through a time in your life,

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:36.779
maybe you're struggling, maybe you're just kinda

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:38.419
just spinning your wheels, so to speak,

00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:40.259
floundering around spiritually,

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:42.579
maybe there's some backsliding that's taking place

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:47.579
and God will use his word in our lives.

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:51.859
And I'm thankful this evening that God is faithful.

00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:54.579
The Bible teaches us as we look at the truth

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:57.139
of chastening and how God seeks

00:24:57.139 --> 00:24:59.579
and how God disciplines his children, why?

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:02.859
Because he loves us, because he loves us.

00:25:04.499 --> 00:25:07.099
It's amazing to me when the Bible tells us

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:08.799
as you look over in the book of James,

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.659
look at James quickly with me,

00:25:10.659 --> 00:25:15.139
and I want you to see this wonderful truth

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:17.099
in James chapter number four.

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:20.379
The thing about the faithfulness of God

00:25:20.379 --> 00:25:23.379
and how he pursues us, and you understand this evening

00:25:23.379 --> 00:25:26.299
that God desires to have close fellowship

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:27.639
with you as his child.

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.859
The Bible says in his presence is fullness of joy.

00:25:31.859 --> 00:25:35.819
I'm thankful that God lets us enter into his presence.

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:37.619
He allows it.

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:41.939
I believe that God, he inhabits the praise of his people.

00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:46.259
God loves when we are in fellowship with him

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:49.219
and when we're seeking to draw nigh unto him.

00:25:49.219 --> 00:25:51.859
And the Bible says this in James four and verse number seven,

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:54.019
submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil,

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.219
and he will flee from you.

00:25:55.219 --> 00:25:57.899
Notice this, draw nigh to God, and notice what it says,

00:25:57.899 --> 00:26:00.679
and he will draw nigh to you.

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:05.159
That's a beautiful, beautiful verse of scripture.

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:08.439
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.

00:26:08.439 --> 00:26:09.719
Cleanse your hands, you sinners,

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:11.679
and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:14.859
And so we find that we are to submit ourselves to God,

00:26:14.859 --> 00:26:17.879
resist the devil, and we're to draw nigh to God

00:26:17.879 --> 00:26:20.079
and understand that he'll draw nigh to us.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.839
I'm thankful that God is faithful.

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:25.159
We mentioned in Sunday school this morning

00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:30.719
the life of Samuel, how God does not force his people

00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:33.319
to take heed to the warnings that he gives,

00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:35.879
but God is faithful to give the warnings.

00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:39.479
God is faithful to pursue his people.

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:42.559
Number five, I would say this,

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:45.559
determined to remain sensitive to God's word.

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:50.259
Determined to remain sensitive to God's word.

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.759
This evening, I'm thankful,

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:56.919
I said at the beginning of the message,

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:58.039
one of the first statements I made

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:00.319
is I'm thankful for God's word.

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:02.019
If we're not careful, we can have a hard heart

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:03.419
towards God's word.

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:04.879
We can become calloused.

00:27:05.739 --> 00:27:07.239
We can become indifferent.

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:12.099
But we must endeavor and ask the Lord to help us

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:14.679
to have hearts that are sensitive.

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:18.859
Hearts that are soft, tender.

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:22.319
The Bible speaks about Josiah, how he had a tender heart.

00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:25.979
And this evening, when we look at this portion of Scripture

00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:28.479
and we understand the importance of remaining sensitive

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:31.659
to the word of God, the Bible says in verse number 19

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:34.039
that he, God, sent mess, prophets to them

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:35.579
to bring them again unto the Lord,

00:27:35.579 --> 00:27:36.979
and they testified against them,

00:27:36.979 --> 00:27:38.579
but they would not give ear.

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:40.579
And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah,

00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:41.779
the son of Jehoiada, the priest,

00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:43.699
which stood above the people and said unto them,

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:46.499
thus saith God, why transgress ye the commandments

00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:48.339
of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper?

00:27:48.339 --> 00:27:49.859
Because ye have forsaken the Lord,

00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:52.419
he hath also forsaken you.

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:54.139
You find that in the end of verse number 19,

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:57.639
notice what the Bible says, but they would not give ear.

00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.819
The Bible says in verse number 20

00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:03.899
that they have forsaken the Lord.

00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:07.139
This is why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord.

00:28:07.139 --> 00:28:09.819
He says that ye cannot prosper.

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:12.299
And we find that as we understand the importance

00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:15.419
this evening of us remaining sensitive to God's word,

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:18.799
that God will use his word in our lives.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.339
But I must be sensitive to it.

00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:24.579
I must be willing to allow God's word

00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:27.299
to chart the course for my life.

00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:29.059
I must be willing to come to a place

00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:31.619
where I'm going to agree with God,

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:35.059
that what God said settles it,

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:36.979
that what God said is true,

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:40.419
that we come to a place where you say,

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:42.339
listen, here's what God says,

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:45.459
and if God confronts me as I read his word,

00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:47.380
as his word is preached and taught,

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.399
as God uses his word in your life and in my life,

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:52.219
as God confronts us, hey, listen,

00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:53.459
you better stop doing that

00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:54.819
because it doesn't please the Lord,

00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:56.739
I remain sensitive to God's word.

00:28:57.739 --> 00:29:00.739
When God says you better start doing this

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:03.380
because this is what pleases me and I'm not doing it,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.539
then I remain sensitive to God's word.

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:08.659
I want you to note the contrast in our text of scripture

00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:11.099
between verse six and verse number 19.

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:13.819
In verse number six, Jehoiada is still alive,

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:16.459
and the Bible tells us this in verse number six.

00:29:16.459 --> 00:29:18.699
It says in the king, that's Joash,

00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:20.679
he called for Jehoiada the chief.

00:29:21.579 --> 00:29:23.339
And notice what he says to him,

00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.819
why hast thou not required the Levites

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:30.059
to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem,

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.279
the collection.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:35.539
Notice what he says, according to the commandment of Moses,

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:37.500
the servant of the Lord.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.099
Guess what he's referring to?

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:41.019
He's referring to the law.

00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:44.419
He's referring to the written word of God.

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:47.659
And we find here that he's saying to Jehoiada,

00:29:47.659 --> 00:29:50.539
that the basis of us making this collection

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:53.299
of going out to Judah and to Jerusalem

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:54.899
to bring in this collection

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:58.099
is in obedience to what God has said.

00:29:58.099 --> 00:30:07.259
And yet we find that in verse number 19, as the prophets of God stand before Him and testify

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:10.699
against them, that they would not give ear.

00:30:10.699 --> 00:30:13.579
Isn't that frightening?

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:17.339
I mean, honestly, when you read this, and you say, listen, I don't want to come to a

00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:19.659
place where I'm hard-hearted.

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:23.859
I don't want to get to a place where I'm calloused to God's Word.

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:28.979
I don't want to get to a place where I feel like I got it figured out, I know it, and

00:30:28.979 --> 00:30:30.219
I just kind of coast.

00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:37.819
No, I want to remain sensitive to the leadership of God in my life, and He uses His Word.

00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:42.779
And this evening, as we look at the life of Joash, we say, how in the world was he so

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:45.619
sensitive to wanting to obey?

00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:47.099
Jehoiada is there.

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:50.539
Jehoiada has some influence, and he's saying we want to obey.

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:53.219
But then there's some princes of Judah that come along.

00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:57.179
And by the way, those that would come along that would seek to influence you to go away

00:30:57.179 --> 00:31:03.659
from what you've been taught, from the ways of the Lord, they're not good influences.

00:31:03.659 --> 00:31:09.979
The Bible says that he then, as he hears the prophets that God so graciously and mercifully

00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:13.939
sent them, that they would not give ear.

00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:18.899
So much so that Zechariah comes, filled with the Spirit of God, delivers a message, and

00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:21.619
they stone him.

00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:23.699
Wow.

00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:30.859
It's amazing.

00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:37.739
As we look to God's Word, how we can have such mixed responses to God's Word from time

00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:42.659
to time in our lives.

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:47.379
I've been here for 12 years and a week.

00:31:47.379 --> 00:31:52.459
I don't think anyone here would know who the individual is, but just in case they did,

00:31:52.459 --> 00:31:55.299
I won't say the name.

00:31:55.299 --> 00:32:01.139
Years and years and years ago, just shortly after we got here, somebody would say to me

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:04.899
regularly, oh, that's the best message I ever heard.

00:32:04.899 --> 00:32:08.659
Oh, man, thank you for preaching God's Word.

00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:09.979
They say it week after week.

00:32:10.579 --> 00:32:18.059
And then all of a sudden, there was a message that kind of hit home more, and it wasn't

00:32:18.059 --> 00:32:23.179
so much a response of, man, I'm glad for that message, it was good that so-and-so was here

00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:25.099
to hear that.

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:27.659
It was, I'm not coming back here anymore.

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:35.379
And I kind of scratched my head, and I thought, how for so many weeks could it be, that was

00:32:35.379 --> 00:32:37.259
the best message I've ever heard?

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:43.059
Now, understand, I don't really take that personally, because I know better, all right?

00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:50.659
But what I'm saying is, how can somebody's response be so sensitive, but then God's Word

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:55.499
confronts them personally on something, and there's a wall that comes up, and it's, nope,

00:32:55.499 --> 00:32:57.859
I don't want that anymore.

00:32:57.859 --> 00:33:01.379
It's sad, but it happens.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:06.259
If we're not careful, we can get a hard heart.

00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:14.299
We must determine to stay sensitive, remain sensitive to God's Word.

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:17.379
People are going to try to tell you God's Word isn't true.

00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:23.259
I said this, I know Breonna's going to Bible college, I've said this over the years, one

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:29.179
of the best places, I use the word best, not in a good sense, but one of the easiest, maybe

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:33.419
that's a better word, places to get backslidden is Bible college.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:35.599
I've been in Bible college.

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:39.879
I believe I can say that, because what happens so often in Bible college, this becomes a

00:33:39.879 --> 00:33:44.059
textbook.

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:45.059
It does.

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:51.559
It becomes a textbook, instead of the living Word of God, the written Word of God.

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:59.439
And we find that sometimes we begin reading portions of Scripture, I mean lengthy portions

00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:03.439
of Scripture for an assignment, because it has to be done.

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:05.679
Oh, we want to be sensitive.

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:12.319
I don't ever want to look, listen, I determine, I don't look at the Bible as a sermon book.

00:34:12.319 --> 00:34:13.319
I don't.

00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:15.599
I don't look at the Bible as a sermon book.

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:18.199
Can you preach sermons out of the Bible?

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.319
Absolutely.

00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:27.279
But if I go to the Bible and just look for a sermon, it's terrible.

00:34:27.279 --> 00:34:34.599
We go to the Bible as God's written Word, perfect preserved, and God ministers, and

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:40.679
God speaks to, and God helps and directs, and then God will help us to have sermons

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:44.639
to preach, messages to deliver.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.759
We must remain sensitive to God's Word.

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:55.939
Number six, I would say this as we close out the chapter, disobedience leads to judgment.

00:34:55.939 --> 00:34:57.819
Disobedience leads to judgment.

00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:01.859
You will not be the exception.

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:07.079
I preached from Genesis 38 last Sunday evening and preached a very similar thought on one

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.579
of the points.

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:15.939
It is a biblical principle that disobedience leads to judgment.

00:35:15.939 --> 00:35:19.019
God is just.

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:20.379
He's a righteous judge.

00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:24.539
I am so thankful that He's gracious, and He's merciful, and He's long-suffering, and we

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.419
could go on and on on all the attributes of God.

00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:34.579
Unfortunately, there are times in people's lives that they are experiencing the long-suffering

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:39.899
of God, the grace and the mercy of God, and unfortunately, they mistake that for being

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:44.259
God's approval of their disobedience.

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:47.419
But God never approves disobedience.

00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:53.819
God is never approving disobedience, and we find here that as we look at this text of

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:59.259
Scripture, notice the Bible says that they testified against them in verse number 19.

00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:02.699
In verse number 20, the Bible says that you cannot prosper.

00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:09.339
The Bible tells us in verse number 18 that when they did these trespasses and all that

00:36:09.339 --> 00:36:13.899
was taking place and how God, it says, and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem.

00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:14.899
Why?

00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:15.899
For this, their trespass.

00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:18.819
But look specifically, if you will, at verse number 23.

00:36:18.819 --> 00:36:24.579
The Bible says, and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of Syria came

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:29.339
up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:34.259
the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:38.779
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:43.559
great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

00:36:43.559 --> 00:36:45.339
So they executed judgment against Joash.

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:50.779
I want you to look at verse 24, and I want you to get something tonight from verse 24.

00:36:50.779 --> 00:36:53.659
How many of you know the story of Gideon, the account of Gideon?

00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:54.659
Right?

00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:56.579
Lydia, how many men did Gideon have?

00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:57.579
300.

00:36:57.579 --> 00:36:58.579
Right?

00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:04.579
The Midianites, thousands, multitude, right?

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:06.259
Who got the victory?

00:37:06.259 --> 00:37:07.859
Gideon.

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:09.379
Why?

00:37:09.379 --> 00:37:10.899
God.

00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:12.499
In one word, God.

00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:15.579
Why did God tell Gideon that his army was too big?

00:37:15.579 --> 00:37:20.659
If I give you the victory with that many people, you're going to say that you got the victory.

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:25.699
I mean, is that basically, we don't have to turn to the judges, we're good, right?

00:37:25.699 --> 00:37:27.059
You're tracking.

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:31.099
Look at verse 25, or 24 again with me.

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:35.179
For the army of the Syrians came with a, what's the Bible say?

00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:39.479
A small company of men.

00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:42.179
A small company of men.

00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:47.059
Here's what it says, and the Lord delivered a, what's it say?

00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:51.419
A very great host into their hand.

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:53.019
Who's their hand?

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:55.779
That's the Syrians, right?

00:37:55.779 --> 00:38:04.419
So God delivered his people, a great number of them, into the hands of the Syrians, who

00:38:04.419 --> 00:38:07.499
only had a small company.

00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:10.979
We like talking about Gideon better, don't we?

00:38:10.979 --> 00:38:14.339
It's easier to preach about Gideon too, because it's exciting.

00:38:14.339 --> 00:38:15.339
Why?

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:19.659
Because God used a small group of his people to deliver them from the oppression of the

00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:21.339
enemy.

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:27.019
But here the Bible says that God, he tells us here that there was a small company of

00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:32.579
men and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:41.899
Notice what the next words say, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

00:38:41.899 --> 00:38:45.099
Wow.

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:49.779
That's impactful.

00:38:49.779 --> 00:38:53.819
They come to Jeremiah, is God going to fight for us?

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:55.619
Jeremiah says God's going to fight against you.

00:38:55.619 --> 00:39:01.899
You say, well, that's exciting.

00:39:01.899 --> 00:39:04.539
Here's where it comes.

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:08.299
Disobedience leads to judgment.

00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:14.339
Verse 25, when they departed from him, for they left him in great diseases, his own servants

00:39:14.339 --> 00:39:18.299
conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada, the priest, and slew him

00:39:18.299 --> 00:39:20.579
on his bed, and he died.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:23.500
They buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.899
kings.

00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:30.859
And these are they that had conspired against him, Zabad the son of Shimeath, and Ammonitus,

00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:34.899
and Jehozabad the son of Shemrith ate Moabitus.

00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:38.979
Now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing

00:39:38.979 --> 00:39:42.099
of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings.

00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:48.359
And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:54.579
As we look at these 27 verses in 2 Chronicles chapter 24, I believe God lets us learn some

00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:57.940
lessons.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.940
As we look at these 27 verses in 2 Chronicles chapter 24, I believe God lets us learn some

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:58.940


00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:05.380
mentors. Recognize the importance of spiritual mentors in your life for all

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:12.980
of us. Be accountable to them. Understand the importance of developing a personal

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:20.260
walk with the Lord. Every day I need to work to develop my personal walk with

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:29.100
God. Every single day I need to be mindful of what am I doing today to draw

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:36.740
closer to God. Be careful who influences you. Before you start jumping on that

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.780
social media and getting on this one and that one and so on and so forth, before

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.260
you start joining that group of friends and listening to, oh but they said this

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.620
and they said that, these princes of Judah gave obeisance to the king. Before

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.900
long he left the house of God and he was serving groves and idols. And then he

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:02.660
killed the son of the one that was his spiritual mentor, Zechariah. Be careful

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:09.860
who influences you. It's tragedy. God is faithful. Aren't you so thankful for that?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:14.900
I'm thankful that our God is faithful. Faithful is he that calleth you who also

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:20.660
will do it. We sing about great is thy faithfulness. God is faithful. I'm

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:25.940
thankful that he pursues his people. He gives us opportunity. He raised up these

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:31.180
prophets. He sent these messengers. Oh that God would help us to be sensitive

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.540
to his word. Every day in our lives, God help me to be sensitive. Help me not to

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:40.700
have a hard heart. Help me not to get calloused. Help me not to just, I got this.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.500
I got it all figured out. And oh we must understand that disobedience leads to

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:53.020
judgment. I'm thankful that God's gracious and he's merciful and he forgives.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:58.900
But understand that disobedience leads to judgment. Our God is just. He's a

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:05.860
righteous judge. Judgment doesn't always come immediately. The harvest is not

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:13.740
immediate. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever man soweth, that shall

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.779
he also reap. That truth in the book of Galatians in the sixth chapter is

00:42:17.779 --> 00:42:23.260
positive and negative. You sow good seeds, you get good crop. You sow bad seeds,

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:29.059
not so much. This evening, we learned some lessons from the life of Joash.

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:32.300
Not only for these young ladies that are getting ready to go to college, but really

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.380
for all of us. Some lessons from the life of Joash. Let's pray together. Father, we

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.580
love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your word, the truth that's

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.779
contained therein. I pray, Lord, that you would help us to take heed to these

00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:53.500
lessons as we can stand and look at this portion of scripture and see in a life

00:42:53.500 --> 00:43:01.979
such a contrast between the time in which Jehoiada is alive and then after his death.

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.900
God, I pray that we would learn these lessons that would apply truth in our

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:10.300
lives. You'd help us, Lord, to be doers of thy word. Help us as we respond now in

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.779
this time of invitation. Would you have your will in way? For it's in Christ's name we pray.
