1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
5 and verse 25, it's a very simple verse.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,239
Brethren, pray for us.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,320
I think all of us can memorize that, amen?

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,960
I think before you leave tonight,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,119
if you don't have this verse memorized already,

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,159
you can add a verse that you have memorized.

7
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,960
Brethren, pray for us.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,319
Can we say it together?

9
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,360
Let's say it together.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,959
Brethren, pray for us.

11
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,680
It's pretty simple, is it not?

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,920
We find that the Apostle Paul,

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
writing to this church in Thessalonica,

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,319
that he, of course, had the opportunity

15
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,639
of going into this city and seeing this church established,

16
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:35,319
knowing many of the people that obviously were there,

17
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,040
hearing of the reports.

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,759
It was during his second missionary journey

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,560
that he had the opportunity to go there.

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,599
What a blessing to think about writing back

21
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:45,500
to a group of people that he originally ministered to

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,360
and encouraging them,

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,080
not only with regard to their spiritual growth,

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,439
but also having received a report

25
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,599
of how they were doing,

26
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,840
commending them for their walk with the Lord.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,159
And we find that here as we close,

28
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,439
and we studied part of this text of scripture

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,639
on Wednesday evenings to start this calendar year

30
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,319
with all of the specific instruction

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,160
that is given, walk worthy, please God.

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,319
And we looked at that,

33
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,720
but we come to verse 25, brethren, pray for us.

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,599
And I would say this prayer

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,760
is a gift from God to his children.

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,080
It really is.

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,559
Prayer is communion with God.

38
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,699
Think about that.

39
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:27,440
The creator of the universe,

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,440
the one who spoke it all into existence,

41
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,919
the one who is all powerful, all knowing

42
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,239
that we have the privilege of being able

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,959
to commune with him, to talk with him.

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,160
We understand that prayer

45
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,959
is not just some religious exercise.

46
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,400
It's not just about memorizing some prayer

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,900
and I'm gonna say my prayers,

48
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,300
kind of an idea with rote religion.

49
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,620
Prayer is communion with God.

50
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,739
It's talking to our heavenly father.

51
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,980
What a unique privilege.

52
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,940
I think about prayer and I understand

53
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,540
that God invites us to pray.

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,699
God hears us when we pray

55
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,539
and then God answers us when we pray.

56
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,860
Isn't that exciting?

57
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,500
To think about the fact that the God of the universe,

58
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,300
he invites you, he invites me

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,779
to enter into his presence to pray.

60
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:20,300
And then he hears us when we pray.

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,139
He hears us.

62
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,940
We all pray at the same time.

63
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,539
We start our services with a time of prayer

64
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,580
because Jesus said that his house

65
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,020
should be a house of prayer.

66
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,259
And I could never understand what everyone is saying

67
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,979
at that particular moment in time,

68
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,619
but God can and God hears our prayers

69
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,940
and God answers our prayers.

70
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,020
And there are times in which we may pray

71
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,660
for an extended period of time.

72
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,500
I was reading just this morning

73
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,699
as I was finishing up the book of 2 Corinthians,

74
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,300
how the Bible tells us that Paul,

75
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,740
he besought the Lord thrice for this thing,

76
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,380
that thorn in the flesh.

77
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,500
And he was persistent.

78
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,979
He was specific in how he prayed.

79
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,979
He prayed that God would, he knew that God could.

80
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,059
And he was persistent,

81
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,699
but God said, my grace is sufficient for thee.

82
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,940
And Paul accepted that answer.

83
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,539
God gave an answer.

84
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,899
It may not have been the answer that he wanted.

85
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,699
It may not be the answer that we want,

86
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,539
but God knows best.

87
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,460
Amen.

88
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,660
And we find that God hears us and God answers us.

89
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,059
Recently, I was musing upon the request of the disciple.

90
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,059
And I use that word singularly because the Bible does

91
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,860
in Luke 11 in verse number one,

92
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,119
when one of the disciples,

93
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,860
there was an individual that came to Jesus.

94
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,860
And that disciple said this, Lord, teach us to pray.

95
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:44,199
Not only did that disciple have a desire to learn,

96
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,940
but that disciple knew that all of the disciples

97
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,940
needed to learn this important subject of prayer.

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Lord, teach us to pray.

99
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,919
As I was musing upon that,

100
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,839
I had this thought that came upon me

101
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:04,860
that there are many methods that can be used when teaching.

102
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,720
In the particular text of scripture in Luke chapter 11,

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,600
if you were to study that portion of scripture,

104
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,679
you will find that immediately after the request is given,

105
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,079
that Jesus responded to the request

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,480
by teaching them verbally, began to teach them.

107
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,440
He said, when thou prayest, here's how you're gonna pray.

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,019
And he begins to give them this model,

109
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,959
this outline, the skeletal form, if you will.

110
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,019
And we give them, this is not a prayer that we memorize

111
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,600
and we just pray it, again, not rote religion.

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,399
But we find that he's giving them this model

113
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,040
and Jesus taught them in that fashion.

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,079
It almost be kind of like teaching on prayer

115
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,359
from a place like this, teaching or preaching

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,079
from a pulpit verbally.

117
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,320
Maybe you think about a classroom and a lecture

118
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,119
that would be given in teaching.

119
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,700
But you know, that's not the only way that we're taught.

120
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,799
As I was musing upon that request of that disciple,

121
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,940
I believe there are times in which God will allow

122
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,760
circumstances into your life and into my life

123
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,220
that teach us to pray.

124
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,519
Sometimes those circumstances are circumstances

125
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,320
that we really don't desire.

126
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,040
Sometimes those circumstances are things

127
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,320
that if we had our choice, we'd say,

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,380
no, I'm okay, I don't want that.

129
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,640
But God may use that thing, that circumstance,

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,079
that situation, that event to drive you,

131
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,079
to drive me to my knees and to truly learn to pray.

132
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,799
Now, many of us will say,

133
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,040
well, I don't really wanna learn that way.

134
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You know that it's definitely an effective means of teaching

135
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,959
and our God, though, he doeth all things well.

136
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,279
He makes no mistakes.

137
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,440
We find that there are times in our lives

138
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
that we've heard a lesson,

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,920
that we've heard some message on prayer

140
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
and maybe we walked away saying,

141
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,399
man, that was the best message on prayer I've ever heard.

142
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,959
Can I tell you that when God brings a circumstance

143
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,640
into your life, it's probably gonna be a whole lot

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,640
more impactful on helping you to truly learn how to pray

145
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:14,079
than what I could ever give or any other preacher

146
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,399
could ever give from a pulpit because God teaches us.

147
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,440
You say, well, I don't wanna learn that way.

148
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,720
Sometimes God chooses that classroom for us.

149
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,959
We don't always get to choose the classroom,

150
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,839
but we ought to learn the lesson, amen.

151
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,059
We don't always get to choose the classroom,

152
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,160
but we ought to learn the lesson.

153
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,799
We find this evening that we think about this subject

154
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,299
of prayer and thinking about how God would teach us

155
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,420
to pray that no doubt various circumstances in life

156
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,940
would drive us to our knees in fervent prayer.

157
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,980
There are times in which we could find in the scriptures

158
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,700
of some of the most amazing events or records, excuse me,

159
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,660
of prayer in the Bible,

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,820
how they're coupled with great difficulty.

161
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,859
I think about Hannah.

162
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,000
We so often speak of Hannah praying,

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,820
but Hannah was driven to her knees in prayer

164
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,600
because she was barren, because of her circumstances,

165
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,100
because of her situation, and she was driven

166
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,859
to her knees in prayer.

167
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:12,059
We find of others that prayed with great fervency,

168
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:16,019
and we think about the circumstances of various heroes

169
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,579
of the faith, and we say, look at how they prayed.

170
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,940
Look at how they got a hold of God,

171
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,119
but there's some circumstances surrounding

172
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,660
those particular prayers that are worth noting

173
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,220
and worth learning from.

174
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,299
This evening, when we think about the apostle Paul

175
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,980
writing to these believers in Thessalonica,

176
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,779
we know that Paul was a man that suffered greatly.

177
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,820
Paul was a man that would soon face a martyr's death.

178
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,700
Paul was a man that it seems as if everywhere he went,

179
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,059
he found some level of opposition.

180
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,899
We find that this particular letter would be written

181
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,600
years before he would actually face a martyr's death,

182
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,420
but we find that it was written really during a time

183
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,140
in which Paul is journeying on his third missionary journey.

184
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
I want you to think about these journeys

185
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,920
and think about the time in which the apostle Paul

186
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,160
is traveling and going and preaching,

187
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,959
and he's going to these cities just as he had done

188
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,839
in Thessalonica during that second missionary journey,

189
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,640
and what a blessing it was for him to know

190
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,820
that people were praying for him.

191
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,799
I find that in Acts chapter 13,

192
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,239
turn back there if you will,

193
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,959
this is actually a record of the first missionary journey,

194
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,959
and the Bible records for us about the church at Antioch

195
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,260
and what a great church it was,

196
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,880
a church that had a vision,

197
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,719
a church that was obedient to the commands of the Lord,

198
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,719
and we find that the Bible tells us

199
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,119
about this church at Antioch,

200
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,900
that the Bible tells us that we're a praying church.

201
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,479
The Bible says in verse number one in Acts 13,

202
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,320
now there were in the church that was at Antioch

203
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,799
certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon

204
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,919
that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manan,

205
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,059
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

206
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,239
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

207
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,080
the Holy Ghost said,

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,520
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

209
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,719
whereunto I have called them,

210
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,559
and it says this,

211
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,599
when they had fasted and prayed

212
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,039
and laid their hands on them,

213
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,080
they sent them away.

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,000
We find that they prayed and they sent,

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,159
they fasted, they prayed and they sent,

216
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,000
and I believe that the church at Antioch

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,840
was a church that prayed for Paul and Barnabas

218
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,919
throughout the duration of this missionary journey.

219
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,599
We find that as they would get back

220
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,880
at the end of chapter 14,

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,960
as they would return to the church at Antioch,

222
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,000
they're all churches gathered together

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
and they're able to rehearse and give a report

224
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,559
of what God did.

225
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,599
In fact, it says in Acts 14, 27,

226
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:40,039
they rehearsed all that God had done with them

227
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,500
and how he'd opened the door of faith under the Gentiles.

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,559
I believe that had to be an exciting moment,

229
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,119
an exciting service, an opportunity to be able to hear

230
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:53,559
how God had specifically answered the prayers

231
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,640
of the believers at the church at Antioch

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,440
as Paul and Barnabas went out

233
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
on that first missionary journey.

234
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,280
So now thinking about the church at Antioch,

235
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,120
or excuse me, the church in Thessalonica,

236
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,040
and Paul saying, brethren, pray for us.

237
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,420
And we find that it's just a simple request

238
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,600
that is given to us here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 25,

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,340
but I want you to notice in 2 Thessalonians 3,

240
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,720
notice what the Bible tells us.

241
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,000
There's a little bit additional information

242
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,700
that is given to us here in the second letter

243
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,140
with regard to adding some details, if you will,

244
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,580
with regard to the prayer, or for the request of prayer.

245
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,520
And this evening, I didn't give you the title.

246
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,280
I think you probably already found out.

247
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,620
It's brethren, pray for us.

248
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,860
And the first thought tonight is this,

249
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,300
the request of Paul, the request, the request of Paul.

250
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,620
Notice in chapter three of 2 Thessalonians,

251
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,940
the Bible says in verse number one,

252
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,760
finally, brethren, pray for us.

253
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,020
Now that was the extent of what he said

254
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,240
in 1 Thessalonians 5, 25, brethren, pray for us.

255
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,080
But we find here in 2 Thessalonians 3,

256
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,880
he says, finally, brethren, pray for us.

257
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
Notice that the word of the Lord may have free course

258
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,200
and be glorified even as it is with you.

259
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,520
I begin to think about the Apostle Paul

260
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,600
sharing with the church in Thessalonica.

261
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,280
He understands the power of prayer

262
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,480
and the privilege of prayer.

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
And the Apostle Paul understands he himself

264
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,760
has been engaged in praying for a variety of people.

265
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,360
He says in many of the letters that he writes

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,680
how he is praying for these believers in these churches

267
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,560
and these individuals specifically

268
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,440
and the way in which he's praying, why?

269
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Because he believes that God hears and answers.

270
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
He then comes here to the church at Thessalonica

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
and he says, I want you to pray for us,

272
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
but I want you to pray that the word of the Lord

273
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,560
would have free course and be glorified

274
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
even as it is with you.

275
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,060
Now think about what Paul is referring to

276
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,680
when he talks to the church at Thessalonica

277
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,020
back in chapter number two of 1 Thessalonians.

278
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,300
He says this in verse number 13.

279
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,420
I'll give you a moment to turn there.

280
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,060
1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 13.

281
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,380
He says, for this cause also thank we God without ceasing.

282
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,300
Why?

283
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,900
Because when ye, when ye, the people in Thessalonica,

284
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,340
when ye receive the word of God which ye heard of us,

285
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,300
ye received it not as the word of men,

286
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
but as it is in truth, the word of God,

287
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,880
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

288
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,840
And so Paul says, pray for us that the word of the Lord

289
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,120
may have free course and be glorified

290
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,820
even as it is with you.

291
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,720
Paul knew, the believers in Thessalonica knew

292
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,280
how when Paul came into the city, what did he do?

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,480
He reasoned out of the scriptures

294
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,440
and they received it not as the word of men,

295
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
but as it is in truth, the word of God,

296
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,840
which effectually worketh in us.

297
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,680
And we find that Paul then says to these believers

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
in Thessalonica, pray for us.

299
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Why?

300
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,940
Because we plan to continue to preach the word of God.

301
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,920
We plan to continue to go to city after city after city

302
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
as God would open doors of ministry opportunities.

303
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,800
We're gonna preach the word and we need,

304
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,680
we request that you pray that the word of the Lord

305
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,720
would have free course.

306
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
Now we know that the Lord Jesus Christ used

307
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,280
in the gospel records, the parable of the sower

308
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,520
went forth to sow seed, right?

309
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,160
And the seed is the word of God.

310
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,720
That's what the seed is, right?

311
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,560
The seed is never designed to be kept in the barn,

312
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,900
by the way, the seed is to be sown.

313
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,600
If you're a farmer, and I know none of us are,

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,660
but if you know anything about farming,

315
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,560
you don't keep the seed in the barn

316
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,460
throughout the time of planting.

317
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,300
Why?

318
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,760
Because you gotta get the seed into the ground

319
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
so that you can have a harvest.

320
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
You don't keep the seed in the barn and then say,

321
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,400
well, it's harvest time and where's all the produce?

322
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
No, you didn't sow the seed.

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,160
But the Bible tells us in that parable

324
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,760
that the enemy comes and tries to steal the seed.

325
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,800
Is that not true?

326
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,360
It's what Jesus teaches us.

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,160
So understand with me as we think about the entirety

328
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,160
of this thought and how this, the apostle Paul

329
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,840
is saying to this group of believers, this local church,

330
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,280
pray for us, and he says specifically in the second letter

331
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,960
that the word of the Lord may have free course

332
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,360
and be glorified even as it is with you.

333
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,000
Remember what Paul said to the church in Corinth.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,880
He said this, that the gospel, if our gospel be hidden,

335
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,320
is hidden to them that are lost.

336
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,160
And then he says this, the God of the world

337
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,800
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

338
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,080
lest the light of the glorious gospel

339
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,880
should shine unto them.

340
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,720
And so Paul understood this spiritual warfare

341
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,000
that was taking place as the sower goes out to plant seed.

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,800
And so therefore, Paul understanding the truth

343
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
that he says to the church in Corinth

344
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,280
that some plant, some water, but God gives the increase.

345
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,080
And so Paul says, I wanna get, I wanna enlist

346
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,140
as many people as I possibly can to pray

347
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,360
that God would bless the sowing of the seed

348
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
that God would use as we go forth.

349
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
Paul says, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna preach,

350
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm gonna go to these cities,

351
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
and I want you, church at Thessalonica, to pray.

352
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,440
Now understand that Paul, not only understanding

353
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,800
the work that would be done

354
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,760
and understanding the spiritual warfare,

355
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,220
turn over to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

356
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,200
in chapter number 11, and I want you to note quickly

357
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,480
some of what Paul records for the church in Corinth

358
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,280
that he had suffered, and some of what he endured

359
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,560
during his ministry, some of the affliction and hardship.

360
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,600
And he begins to share this in 2 Corinthians,

361
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,360
chapter number 11, and notice he says this.

362
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,960
I begin in verse number 22.

363
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,800
The Bible says, are they Hebrews?

364
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,620
So am I.

365
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,460
Are they Israelites?

366
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,300
So am I.

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,200
Are they the seed of Abraham?

368
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,040
So am I.

369
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Are they ministers of Christ?

370
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
I speak as a fool.

371
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,720
I am more.

372
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
And then notice, he begins to get into this list.

373
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,280
In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure,

374
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,440
in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

375
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,020
Of the Jews, five times received I 40 stripes, save one.

376
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,480
You understand that they were taught

377
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,760
to be able to beat a man.

378
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,040
Truly, they would use the phraseology

379
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
within an inch of their life.

380
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,480
I mean, they mastered this cruel punishment

381
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,400
to take this whip and to whip the people

382
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,680
that they were trying to, in this case, Paul,

383
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,800
who was not an evildoer or wrongdoer,

384
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
because he was preaching the word, to whip him.

385
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,640
Why?

386
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,620
So that he'd stop.

387
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,260
So he would no longer preach.

388
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,980
And we find that he says this.

389
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,340
Five times received I 40 stripes, save one.

390
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,100
They said that would be 39 times.

391
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,540
They say if you did it 40 times, you'd kill a man.

392
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,420
They try to bring you as close to death as possible

393
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,460
without actually killing you,

394
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,860
so that you would refrain from doing

395
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,540
whatever it was that you were doing.

396
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,060
Notice in verse number 25,

397
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,860
thrice was I beaten with rods.

398
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,340
Once was I stoned.

399
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,820
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

400
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,740
A night and a day I've been in the deep.

401
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,980
In journeyings often, in perils of waters,

402
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,820
in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen,

403
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,940
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city,

404
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,300
in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,

405
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,860
in perils among false brethren,

406
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,740
in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often,

407
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,260
in hunger and thirst, in fastings often,

408
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,220
in cold and nakedness.

409
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,900
I want you to think about all these things

410
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,540
that Paul mentions, and then he finishes up in verse 28,

411
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,940
and he says, beside those things that are without,

412
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,240
that which cometh upon me daily,

413
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,440
the care of all the churches.

414
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,180
And so Paul, he knows the battle,

415
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,360
he knows what he's been facing,

416
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,040
and so he says to the church in Thessalonica,

417
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,920
here in 2 Thessalonians 3,

418
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,960
we read in verse number one how that he made that request

419
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,620
that the word of the Lord would be glorified

420
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,600
and have free course, and be glorified even as is with you,

421
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,040
but then in verse number two he says,

422
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,520
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable

423
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,660
and wicked men, for all men have not faith.

424
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,740
Now, Paul understood something about the spiritual battle,

425
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,280
spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

426
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,300
And so he says, brethren, pray for us.

427
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,080
Brethren, pray for us.

428
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,400
We're gonna go do the work,

429
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,060
we're gonna go do what God has called us to do,

430
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,420
and we want you to pray specifically

431
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,580
that the word of the Lord would have free course

432
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,340
and be glorified even as it is with you,

433
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,080
but also pray because we're gonna face some opposition.

434
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
We're gonna face some opposition.

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
The apostle Paul made this statement as he's writing

436
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
to the believers in Corinth, he says this,

437
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
that there is a great door in 1 Corinthians 16 and verse nine

438
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,799
for a great door and effectual is open unto me,

439
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,000
and there are many adversaries.

440
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,160
But I want you to notice verse three

441
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,760
of 2 Thessalonians chapter three.

442
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,119
It says, but the Lord is faithful.

443
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,820
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

444
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,700
Praise the Lord, we have a faithful God.

445
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,980
He says, but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you

446
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,140
and keep you from evil.

447
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,940
The request of Paul is given,

448
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,420
and I've mentioned much about it.

449
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,059
I would say this, it really is a simple request, is it not?

450
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,580
Brethren, pray for us, and here is how I want you to pray.

451
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,220
It's pretty simple.

452
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,320
I would say this, it's a sincere request.

453
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,500
I see the sincerity of Paul.

454
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,220
I understand that Paul, he knew in his own life

455
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,299
the importance of prayer.

456
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,900
He knew how important it was to involve

457
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,619
and to enlist others to be praying on his behalf,

458
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,739
and as they would go and do the work on the ground,

459
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,780
so to speak, that there were people

460
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,619
that were holding the ropes back at the other churches

461
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,220
and praying for them.

462
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,299
I believe he was sincere in his request.

463
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,140
It was not just some kind of cliche,

464
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,260
some kind of closing remarks that you would give

465
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,739
in a correspondence to an individual or to a church.

466
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,980
Oh yeah, by the way, pray for me.

467
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,340
No, this was a sincere.

468
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,340
because he understood what prayer was.

469
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
I note the request of Paul.

470
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,340
I note the response of the people, number two.

471
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,340
We find that the people seem to have responded by praying.

472
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,340
It seems as if Paul had this confidence.

473
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Notice here in 2 Thessalonians 3 and verse number 4,

474
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
the Bible says,

475
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,340
and we have confidence in the Lord touching you

476
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,340
that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

477
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
You know, it's an encouraging thing to know

478
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
that somebody's going to pray for you.

479
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
It truly is.

480
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,340
When Paul is writing in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

481
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,340
to this church in Thessalonica,

482
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,340
he asks, he gives the request that they would pray,

483
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,340
but even as he gives the request, he says to them,

484
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
I have confidence.

485
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,340
I have confidence in the Lord touching you

486
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,340
that you both do and will do the things which we command you.

487
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
When you need prayer,

488
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm talking about one of those situations

489
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
where God brings a circumstance into your life

490
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,340
to teach you to pray when you need prayer.

491
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,340
You know who you're going to ask to pray for you?

492
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Somebody that you believe prays.

493
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Am I right?

494
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,340
You're going to ask somebody that you believe

495
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
believes in prayer,

496
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,340
that you believe they are a prayer warrior.

497
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,340
We use that term sometimes.

498
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
And you're going to go to them and you're going to say,

499
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
would you pray for me?

500
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
You may be able to give them specifics.

501
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
You may be able to outline for them why it is

502
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,340
that you need prayer about a specific situation,

503
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
whatever that situation may be.

504
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
It may be that you're not at liberty to be able to even say,

505
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
but you know, you have confidence

506
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,340
that they will bring the petition

507
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
before the all-knowing God

508
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
who can answer a prayer

509
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,340
that I don't even know the specifics of what I'm praying.

510
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
You think about that just for a moment.

511
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
There have been times in which we'll have prayer time

512
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,340
and we'll say, well, I don't know who the person was.

513
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,340
I can't remember their name. I don't remember.

514
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,340
God knows. You ever hear somebody say something like that?

515
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Because God knows everything.

516
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
And God knows.

517
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
And somebody can come and say, would you,

518
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
I can't tell you everything that's going on,

519
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
but would you just pray?

520
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Can I assure you tonight that God knows what's going on?

521
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,340
And that God can answer that prayer

522
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
as you pray without having,

523
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
you don't have to know.

524
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Because God knows.

525
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
But you can still go before the throne of grace.

526
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,340
Say, God, I don't know what that brother,

527
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
that sister is dealing with.

528
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
I don't know what the circumstance is.

529
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
But God, I rest in knowing that you know,

530
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
and I pray that you'd work, that you would,

531
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,340
and you can just begin to trust

532
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
how God will work.

533
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,340
So this evening,

534
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
as we think about this idea, brethren,

535
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,340
pray for us in this request

536
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
and the response of the people

537
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
where Paul says, I have confidence

538
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,340
in the Lord touching you

539
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
and we both do and will do the things

540
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
which we command you.

541
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,340
It's a blessing to know that people

542
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
are praying for you.

543
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
I would say to you this evening,

544
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
as we prepare for this missions

545
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
trip that we're taking,

546
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
that not only as your pastor,

547
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,340
but as a spokesman, if I can, for the team

548
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,340
of folks that will be going to Panama,

549
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,340
I believe that we would collectively

550
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,340
say to you, brethren,

551
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
pray for us.

552
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Pray for us.

553
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,340
This morning, we're not going on vacation.

554
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,340
We really aren't. It's going to be a lot of ministry.

555
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
And I'm excited about that.

556
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
We're going to go down there.

557
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Brother Deal and the church,

558
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
they have soul winning visitation

559
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
three times a week, four times a week.

560
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,340
I mean, they're just busy trying to reach Panama

561
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,340
for Christ.

562
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,340
And we're going to go down there

563
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,340
and we're going to be going out and we're going to be distributing literature.

564
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
We're going to be talking to folks.

565
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
We're going to just be knocking doors

566
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
and going into various communities

567
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
where they have bus routes that pick up

568
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
children on Sunday mornings and so on and so forth.

569
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,340
We're going to be doing the ministry.

570
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
I'm going to preach four times. I'm going to preach on Thursday night.

571
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
They don't have a Wednesday night service. They have a Thursday night service.

572
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
So I'll preach on Thursday night.

573
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
Folks from our team

574
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,340
that are going will be teaching

575
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
every Sunday school class that they have on Sunday.

576
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
They have six classes

577
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,340
and we'll have folks teaching.

578
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Actually, the nursery class, we won't have anyone teaching that class,

579
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,340
but we'll be teaching all the other classes.

580
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
And then during the junior church type

581
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
hour, they call it something different,

582
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
a couple of folks from our group

583
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
will be teaching that age group

584
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
while I'm preaching in the morning service.

585
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,340
We're going to be doing a lot of ministry

586
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
and I'm excited about that. That's what a missions trip should be.

587
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Going to do ministry.

588
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,340
And so if I could give you

589
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,340
tonight some specifics

590
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,340
on how you can pray

591
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
for us.

592
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
We see that the Apostle Paul,

593
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
as he's endeavoring to go and serve

594
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
the Lord on this missionary journey

595
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
he's going and writing back to the church

596
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,340
at Thessalonica a group of people

597
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
that he knew, a group of people

598
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,340
that he believed prayed

599
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,340
and he's going to go to them and say,

600
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
would you pray for us in this manner?

601
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
And so I'm going to say to you this evening,

602
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,340
would you pray for us in this manner?

603
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,340
Would you pray for us, number one, that we'd have safety?

604
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Pray for our safety.

605
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
And we're going to be flying. I know some of you like to fly.

606
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Some of you don't like to fly.

607
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
We're going to fly and we trust that God would give us safety

608
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
as we fly down to Panama.

609
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
We are thankful that we have direct flights

610
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
both to and from, but would you pray

611
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
for us? And would you pray

612
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,340
that God would give us safety while we're in the country?

613
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,340
As we're moving about

614
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
the country, as we're going from one location

615
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
to another location, as we're out

616
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,340
distributing literature and all those things.

617
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
Here's what the Bible says. The Bible says

618
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
that the horse is prepared for the day of battle,

619
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
but safety is of the

620
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Lord. And so when we talk about praying for

621
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
safety, I want you to pray for us.

622
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
We've got a group of 11 of us going

623
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
and I'm not sure which one of us

624
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,340
in the group is the oldest. It doesn't really

625
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,340
matter. We've got a bunch of adults, but we've got all the way

626
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
down through Lucas is going with us.

627
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
And so Lucas would be the youngest

628
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
and Lucas is how old? How old is

629
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Lucas? Tim has no idea.

630
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Deanna, she doesn't know either.

631
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Lucas, he's 13.

632
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,340
Lucas is 13. Thank you, Joseph.

633
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,340
And he's got it, right? He's on the ball.

634
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,340
And Lucas is 13, so he's the

635
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,340
youngest in our group. And we've got

636
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,340
some ladies that are going with us. It's not just

637
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
a group of men, so we've got ladies that are going with us.

638
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,340
And so you pray for our safety.

639
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,340
Pray that God would give us unity.

640
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,340
That God would give us unity.

641
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,340
You know, the enemy would love

642
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,340
to cause our group to be

643
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
at odds one with another.

644
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
The enemy would love that. Why?

645
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Because if we're so divided and we're

646
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
kind of having issues amongst our group, guess

647
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,340
what? We're not going to be very effective in ministry.

648
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
That's why the devil is always trying to

649
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
cause disunity in the house

650
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
of God. Because if we're,

651
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
listen, if the church

652
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
at Corinth is so focused on fighting

653
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
amongst themselves, guess what they're not doing?

654
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
They're not reaching the city of

655
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Corinth with the gospel.

656
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
That's what's happening, because they're all internal.

657
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,340
They're all looking at what's going on and having

658
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,340
these I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas, I'm of Apollos,

659
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,340
so on and so forth. Pray for our health.

660
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Pray for our health. If you've ever

661
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
traveled internationally,

662
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
you know that there are some things

663
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,340
that could potentially pop up as

664
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
health concerns. And Panama

665
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
is a relatively developed

666
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
country, but it is not

667
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
where we live and where we

668
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
consume the

669
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
goods and what have you. So we've always got to be

670
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
careful with consuming water and products that

671
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
are washed and so on and so forth. But pray that God

672
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
will give us health. And why do I pray for all

673
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
those things? Well, really I ask

674
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
you to pray for those things to really lead up

675
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
to the main thing, and that is for the ministry

676
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
opportunities. Listen,

677
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
if we don't have safety, we're not going to be able

678
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
to have the ministry opportunities. If we don't have

679
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,340
the unity, we're not going to have the

680
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
ministry opportunities. If we don't have the health, we're not

681
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
going to have the ministry opportunities.

682
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
And so as we have these ministry opportunities

683
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
of distributing

684
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
John and Romans, distributing gospel

685
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
tracts, going door to door, teaching,

686
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
preaching, singing, ministering

687
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
music. I'm not doing the singing and music

688
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
part, but we'll be doing all of

689
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,340
that. We're going to serve the Lord

690
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
and we're going to be a blessing.

691
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
We're going to be a blessing not only to Brother Deal and to

692
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
his church family, or to

693
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
his family and to his church family, but we understand

694
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
that there are going to be

695
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
according to what Brother Deal

696
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
is expecting, there are going to be a lot

697
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
of first-time visitors this Sunday

698
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
when we will be there on the 15th of

699
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
September. Here's what they're doing.

700
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Today was week three of their, what

701
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
they call a fall campaign. Now it's not

702
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
fall in Panama. They don't really

703
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
have seasons like we have

704
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
as far as the

705
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
time of year where it is there. They have,

706
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
according to Brother Deal, they have the wet season and the dry

707
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
season. And the wet season is from March

708
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
to December, so that's pretty much almost the

709
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
entire year. And so they're

710
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
in the midst of the wet season,

711
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
but during this time of year they have a

712
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
four-week Sunday school push.

713
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
And through this Sunday school push they

714
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
offer to the children and to the adults

715
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
as well various objectives,

716
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
being able to earn points and what have you,

717
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
and memorizing

718
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
verses, bringing visitors,

719
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
you fill in the blank. And they do

720
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
this and they have this

721
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
four-week concentrated effort

722
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
that they have in their church.

723
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
And so next Sunday will be the fourth

724
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
week. And therefore

725
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
they will have a number of things that will be going on

726
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
where children will receive

727
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
prizes and be able to use

728
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
the points that they've earned to be able to

729
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
participate in a variety of things. And so therefore

730
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
it's the last day, so they're

731
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
expecting the biggest number

732
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
of people in attendance. He told

733
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
me that he would not

734
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,340
be surprised if we had 50 to

735
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
75 first-time visitors.

736
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
That's a lot of visitors.

737
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,340
And here's what he asked me.

738
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,340
We're all going to teach the same lesson

739
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
for Sunday school. And he said,

740
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Preacher, would you write the message

741
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
and would you make it as

742
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
clear and simple the gospel

743
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
as possible because we want to give

744
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
the gospel and see souls saved.

745
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
So would you pray that souls would be saved?

746
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
Would you pray that they would be open and receptive?

747
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
I have a lesson that we're going to

748
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
teach. It's already been given to all those that will

749
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
be teaching in our group.

750
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
What must I do

751
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
to be saved?

752
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Is that not a simple passage of

753
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
scripture?

754
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,740
I do to be saved, and I will be teaching that during the Sunday school hour, and then I'll

755
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,500
be preaching in the morning service about the gift of God, which is the eternal life,

756
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,980
and there'll be a number of people in the morning service that won't be there for the

757
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,260
Sunday school hour, and so we're looking forward to that, and I trust that you would pray that

758
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
souls would be saved.

759
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,140
I'm thankful that God is still saving souls.

760
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm thankful that He is still able to save, amen, that He said, listen, the promise of

761
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,560
Romans 10, 13 is as true today as it ever has been, for whosoever shall call upon the

762
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,920
name of the Lord shall be saved, and so I want you to pray that souls would be saved.

763
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Would you pray that God's power would rest upon us?

764
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,980
Here's the reality.

765
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,880
Without Him, we can do nothing.

766
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,560
Without Him, we can do nothing.

767
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,560
By the way, without Him, you can do nothing.

768
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,040
We need Him.

769
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,160
We need Him, and I want to ask you to pray.

770
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,200
This is our first church-wide, under my leadership as the pastor, missions trip that we'll be

771
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
taking.

772
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,680
I've gone on my own to Mexico, and I've done some other things, missions related, but this

773
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,240
is the first trip that's opened up to the church family being invited and interested

774
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
in being able to go.

775
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
We've got 11 people going.

776
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm excited about that.

777
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,360
I'm excited about that, and I hope that God does something in our hearts and our lives.

778
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
I want you to pray to that way.

779
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,800
I want you to pray that God stirs us, that it's not just a, yep, we went on a missions

780
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,480
trip, but that God truly does something in our hearts, and then what's going to happen

781
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,720
is we're going to come back, and it's going to do something in your hearts, do something

782
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,400
in your life.

783
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,760
If you're praying, as I'm asking you to, then on Sunday night, the 22nd of September, you'll

784
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,040
be able to rejoice as we give an update as to what God did and how God heard your prayers

785
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:56,080
and how God answered your prayers, and you'll be vested in that.

786
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,400
What a great opportunity that God would give us.

787
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm going to give you very quickly the names of the folks that are going.

788
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,880
Some of you know already, but some of you do not know.

789
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,200
So I'm going, Holly's going, Brianna and Joseph, the four of us are going, and then there are

790
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,240
three Trejos that are going, Armando, Tim, and Lucas, those three, and then we have Brother

791
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,640
Jeff is going with us, and then we have Ms. Erica, Ms. Jennifer, and Ms. Lena, all right?

792
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,000
So there's going to be 11 of us that are going, and we're looking forward to it, but we know

793
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,680
that we need you to pray.

794
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,920
I know that we need you to pray, and I speak not only as your pastor, but I speak as a

795
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:45,080
representative of the group, brethren, pray for us, and if you would, listen, we could

796
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,960
add so many things on how you could pray specifically, but I just give you those few

797
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,760
thoughts tonight.

798
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,600
If you would pray specifically, pray fervently, I'm not going to ask you to make a commitment

799
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,320
to me, I'm going to ask you to make a commitment to God, that you would pray for us each day

800
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,760
that we're there.

801
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,560
We leave Tuesday morning, our flight leaves at 9.30, Lord willing, and it's a direct flight,

802
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,760
we'll get down there, it's an hour behind us in time, it's a five-hour flight, we'll

803
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,440
get there at 1.30 local time, and we'll be heading back on the 16th, which is Monday,

804
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,520
we fly back late Monday night, early Tuesday morning, we land technically on the 17th at

805
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,080
12.30 in the morning, and so you pray that God gives us a wonderful week of ministry,

806
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,040
and we look forward to hearing not only what God does here, but I look forward to being

807
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:34,440
able to share with you what God does in the country of Panama through the group from Fellowship

808
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,680
Baptist Church that's going to go.

809
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Ron, you got a question?

810
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Repeat the names.

811
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,600
So the four of us, three Trejos, Armando, Tim, and Lucas, and then Brother Jeff, Miss

812
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,440
Erica, Miss Lena, and Miss Jennifer.

813
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
All right?

814
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,800
All right, let's pray together.

815
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, thank you for your word, God, I thank

816
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,280
you for the Apostle Paul, and I thank you for the ministry that you used him to accomplish,

817
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,880
but we understand several things.

818
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,200
Number one, he was yielded and surrendered to you, he followed your voice and your direction,

819
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,600
but number two, there was an army of people praying for him, and God, I pray that you

820
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,280
would help us to acknowledge this evening the importance of prayer, and Father, that

821
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,800
we would make a commitment to you, Lord, that we would pray.

822
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,480
I pray, Father, that you would watch over the group that goes, that you would use us

823
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,640
for your honor and for your glory, that your power would rest upon us, Lord, that you would

824
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,640
give us unique ministry opportunities, that we'd see souls saved, lives changed, I pray

825
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,440
God that you'd give us health and safety and unity, I pray God that you would be glorified,

826
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,760
that you would do a work in our hearts over this next week, I pray for our church family,

827
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,120
Lord, I pray that you'd watch over them and use them, I pray that even as we go to a foreign

828
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,840
country to minister, that even as we minister daily, as we have those opportunities, I pray

829
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,720
that you'd use our church family, and God, I pray for Pastor Aylstock, as he'll be filling

830
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,840
the pulpit, I pray God that you'd use him, I pray that our folks would be encouraged,

831
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,000
and God, I pray that you'd work in a distinct way that we would have the opportunity on

832
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
a couple of Sundays from now to come together as a church family and to rejoice greatly,

833
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,560
to glorify you for all that you'll do, God, we believe that you want to work, we believe

834
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,160
that you're able to work, and I pray that you'd simply use us, that God, you'd be glorified,

835
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,760
we'll give you all the honor, it's due unto your name, it's in Christ's name we pray.
