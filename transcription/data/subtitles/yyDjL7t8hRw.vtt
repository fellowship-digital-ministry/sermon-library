00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
5 and verse 25, it's a very simple verse.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.239
Brethren, pray for us.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.320
I think all of us can memorize that, amen?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.960
I think before you leave tonight,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.119
if you don't have this verse memorized already,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.159
you can add a verse that you have memorized.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.960
Brethren, pray for us.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.319
Can we say it together?

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:18.360
Let's say it together.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.959
Brethren, pray for us.

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:22.680
It's pretty simple, is it not?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.920
We find that the Apostle Paul,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.600
writing to this church in Thessalonica,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.319
that he, of course, had the opportunity

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.639
of going into this city and seeing this church established,

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:35.319
knowing many of the people that obviously were there,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.040
hearing of the reports.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.759
It was during his second missionary journey

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:40.560
that he had the opportunity to go there.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.599
What a blessing to think about writing back

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:45.500
to a group of people that he originally ministered to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.360
and encouraging them,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.080
not only with regard to their spiritual growth,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.439
but also having received a report

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:55.599
of how they were doing,

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:58.840
commending them for their walk with the Lord.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.159
And we find that here as we close,

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.439
and we studied part of this text of scripture

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.639
on Wednesday evenings to start this calendar year

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:09.319
with all of the specific instruction

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.160
that is given, walk worthy, please God.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.319
And we looked at that,

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.720
but we come to verse 25, brethren, pray for us.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.599
And I would say this prayer

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.760
is a gift from God to his children.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.080
It really is.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.559
Prayer is communion with God.

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:25.699
Think about that.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:27.440
The creator of the universe,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
the one who spoke it all into existence,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.919
the one who is all powerful, all knowing

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.239
that we have the privilege of being able

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.959
to commune with him, to talk with him.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.160
We understand that prayer

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.959
is not just some religious exercise.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.400
It's not just about memorizing some prayer

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.900
and I'm gonna say my prayers,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.300
kind of an idea with rote religion.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.620
Prayer is communion with God.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.739
It's talking to our heavenly father.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:58.980
What a unique privilege.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.940
I think about prayer and I understand

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.540
that God invites us to pray.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.699
God hears us when we pray

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:08.539
and then God answers us when we pray.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.860
Isn't that exciting?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.500
To think about the fact that the God of the universe,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.300
he invites you, he invites me

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.779
to enter into his presence to pray.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.300
And then he hears us when we pray.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.139
He hears us.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.940
We all pray at the same time.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.539
We start our services with a time of prayer

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.580
because Jesus said that his house

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.020
should be a house of prayer.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.259
And I could never understand what everyone is saying

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.979
at that particular moment in time,

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.619
but God can and God hears our prayers

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.940
and God answers our prayers.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.020
And there are times in which we may pray

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.660
for an extended period of time.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.500
I was reading just this morning

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.699
as I was finishing up the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.300
how the Bible tells us that Paul,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.740
he besought the Lord thrice for this thing,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.380
that thorn in the flesh.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.500
And he was persistent.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.979
He was specific in how he prayed.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
He prayed that God would, he knew that God could.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.059
And he was persistent,

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.699
but God said, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.940
And Paul accepted that answer.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.539
God gave an answer.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.899
It may not have been the answer that he wanted.

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.699
It may not be the answer that we want,

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.539
but God knows best.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:16.460
Amen.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.660
And we find that God hears us and God answers us.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.059
Recently, I was musing upon the request of the disciple.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.059
And I use that word singularly because the Bible does

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.860
in Luke 11 in verse number one,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.119
when one of the disciples,

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.860
there was an individual that came to Jesus.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860
And that disciple said this, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.199
Not only did that disciple have a desire to learn,

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.940
but that disciple knew that all of the disciples

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.940
needed to learn this important subject of prayer.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.520
Lord, teach us to pray.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.919
As I was musing upon that,

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.839
I had this thought that came upon me

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.860
that there are many methods that can be used when teaching.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720
In the particular text of scripture in Luke chapter 11,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.600
if you were to study that portion of scripture,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.679
you will find that immediately after the request is given,

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.079
that Jesus responded to the request

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.480
by teaching them verbally, began to teach them.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.440
He said, when thou prayest, here's how you're gonna pray.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.019
And he begins to give them this model,

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:27.959
this outline, the skeletal form, if you will.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:31.019
And we give them, this is not a prayer that we memorize

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.600
and we just pray it, again, not rote religion.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.399
But we find that he's giving them this model

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.040
and Jesus taught them in that fashion.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.079
It almost be kind of like teaching on prayer

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.359
from a place like this, teaching or preaching

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.079
from a pulpit verbally.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:47.320
Maybe you think about a classroom and a lecture

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.119
that would be given in teaching.

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.700
But you know, that's not the only way that we're taught.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:57.799
As I was musing upon that request of that disciple,

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.940
I believe there are times in which God will allow

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.760
circumstances into your life and into my life

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.220
that teach us to pray.

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:09.519
Sometimes those circumstances are circumstances

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.320
that we really don't desire.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.040
Sometimes those circumstances are things

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.320
that if we had our choice, we'd say,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.380
no, I'm okay, I don't want that.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.640
But God may use that thing, that circumstance,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.079
that situation, that event to drive you,

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:31.079
to drive me to my knees and to truly learn to pray.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:33.799
Now, many of us will say,

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:36.040
well, I don't really wanna learn that way.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.040
You know that it's definitely an effective means of teaching

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.959
and our God, though, he doeth all things well.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.279
He makes no mistakes.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.440
We find that there are times in our lives

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.600
that we've heard a lesson,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.920
that we've heard some message on prayer

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.200
and maybe we walked away saying,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.399
man, that was the best message on prayer I've ever heard.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.959
Can I tell you that when God brings a circumstance

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:06.640
into your life, it's probably gonna be a whole lot

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.640
more impactful on helping you to truly learn how to pray

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:14.079
than what I could ever give or any other preacher

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:18.399
could ever give from a pulpit because God teaches us.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.440
You say, well, I don't wanna learn that way.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.720
Sometimes God chooses that classroom for us.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.959
We don't always get to choose the classroom,

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.839
but we ought to learn the lesson, amen.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.059
We don't always get to choose the classroom,

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.160
but we ought to learn the lesson.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.799
We find this evening that we think about this subject

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:38.299
of prayer and thinking about how God would teach us

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.420
to pray that no doubt various circumstances in life

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.940
would drive us to our knees in fervent prayer.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.980
There are times in which we could find in the scriptures

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.700
of some of the most amazing events or records, excuse me,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.660
of prayer in the Bible,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.820
how they're coupled with great difficulty.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.859
I think about Hannah.

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:00.000
We so often speak of Hannah praying,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.820
but Hannah was driven to her knees in prayer

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.600
because she was barren, because of her circumstances,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.100
because of her situation, and she was driven

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.859
to her knees in prayer.

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:12.059
We find of others that prayed with great fervency,

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:16.019
and we think about the circumstances of various heroes

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.579
of the faith, and we say, look at how they prayed.

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:20.940
Look at how they got a hold of God,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.119
but there's some circumstances surrounding

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:26.660
those particular prayers that are worth noting

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.220
and worth learning from.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.299
This evening, when we think about the apostle Paul

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.980
writing to these believers in Thessalonica,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.779
we know that Paul was a man that suffered greatly.

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.820
Paul was a man that would soon face a martyr's death.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.700
Paul was a man that it seems as if everywhere he went,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.059
he found some level of opposition.

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:50.899
We find that this particular letter would be written

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:54.600
years before he would actually face a martyr's death,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.420
but we find that it was written really during a time

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.140
in which Paul is journeying on his third missionary journey.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.820
I want you to think about these journeys

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.920
and think about the time in which the apostle Paul

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.160
is traveling and going and preaching,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.959
and he's going to these cities just as he had done

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.839
in Thessalonica during that second missionary journey,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.640
and what a blessing it was for him to know

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.820
that people were praying for him.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.799
I find that in Acts chapter 13,

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:22.239
turn back there if you will,

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:24.959
this is actually a record of the first missionary journey,

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:27.959
and the Bible records for us about the church at Antioch

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.260
and what a great church it was,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.880
a church that had a vision,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.719
a church that was obedient to the commands of the Lord,

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:35.719
and we find that the Bible tells us

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.119
about this church at Antioch,

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:40.900
that the Bible tells us that we're a praying church.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.479
The Bible says in verse number one in Acts 13,

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:46.320
now there were in the church that was at Antioch

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.799
certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.919
that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manan,

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:56.059
which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and Saul.

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:58.239
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted,

00:08:58.239 --> 00:08:59.080
the Holy Ghost said,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.520
separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.719
whereunto I have called them,

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:03.559
and it says this,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:05.599
when they had fasted and prayed

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.039
and laid their hands on them,

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:10.080
they sent them away.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.000
We find that they prayed and they sent,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.159
they fasted, they prayed and they sent,

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:17.000
and I believe that the church at Antioch

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.840
was a church that prayed for Paul and Barnabas

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.919
throughout the duration of this missionary journey.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.599
We find that as they would get back

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:26.880
at the end of chapter 14,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.960
as they would return to the church at Antioch,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.000
they're all churches gathered together

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.400
and they're able to rehearse and give a report

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.559
of what God did.

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:36.599
In fact, it says in Acts 14, 27,

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:40.039
they rehearsed all that God had done with them

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:43.500
and how he'd opened the door of faith under the Gentiles.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.559
I believe that had to be an exciting moment,

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:50.119
an exciting service, an opportunity to be able to hear

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:53.559
how God had specifically answered the prayers

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.640
of the believers at the church at Antioch

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.440
as Paul and Barnabas went out

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.080
on that first missionary journey.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.280
So now thinking about the church at Antioch,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.120
or excuse me, the church in Thessalonica,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.040
and Paul saying, brethren, pray for us.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.420
And we find that it's just a simple request

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.600
that is given to us here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 25,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.340
but I want you to notice in 2 Thessalonians 3,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.720
notice what the Bible tells us.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.000
There's a little bit additional information

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.700
that is given to us here in the second letter

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.140
with regard to adding some details, if you will,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.580
with regard to the prayer, or for the request of prayer.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.520
And this evening, I didn't give you the title.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.280
I think you probably already found out.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.620
It's brethren, pray for us.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.860
And the first thought tonight is this,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.300
the request of Paul, the request, the request of Paul.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.620
Notice in chapter three of 2 Thessalonians,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.940
the Bible says in verse number one,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.760
finally, brethren, pray for us.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.020
Now that was the extent of what he said

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.240
in 1 Thessalonians 5, 25, brethren, pray for us.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.080
But we find here in 2 Thessalonians 3,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.880
he says, finally, brethren, pray for us.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.200
Notice that the word of the Lord may have free course

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.200
and be glorified even as it is with you.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.520
I begin to think about the Apostle Paul

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.600
sharing with the church in Thessalonica.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.280
He understands the power of prayer

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.480
and the privilege of prayer.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.040
And the Apostle Paul understands he himself

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.760
has been engaged in praying for a variety of people.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.360
He says in many of the letters that he writes

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.680
how he is praying for these believers in these churches

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.560
and these individuals specifically

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.440
and the way in which he's praying, why?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.080
Because he believes that God hears and answers.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.400
He then comes here to the church at Thessalonica

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.400
and he says, I want you to pray for us,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.040
but I want you to pray that the word of the Lord

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.560
would have free course and be glorified

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.480
even as it is with you.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.060
Now think about what Paul is referring to

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.680
when he talks to the church at Thessalonica

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.020
back in chapter number two of 1 Thessalonians.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.300
He says this in verse number 13.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.420
I'll give you a moment to turn there.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.060
1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 13.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.380
He says, for this cause also thank we God without ceasing.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.300
Why?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.900
Because when ye, when ye, the people in Thessalonica,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.340
when ye receive the word of God which ye heard of us,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.300
ye received it not as the word of men,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.200
but as it is in truth, the word of God,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.880
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.840
And so Paul says, pray for us that the word of the Lord

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.120
may have free course and be glorified

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.820
even as it is with you.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.720
Paul knew, the believers in Thessalonica knew

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.280
how when Paul came into the city, what did he do?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.480
He reasoned out of the scriptures

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.440
and they received it not as the word of men,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.440
but as it is in truth, the word of God,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.840
which effectually worketh in us.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.680
And we find that Paul then says to these believers

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.680
in Thessalonica, pray for us.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.520
Why?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.940
Because we plan to continue to preach the word of God.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.920
We plan to continue to go to city after city after city

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.040
as God would open doors of ministry opportunities.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.800
We're gonna preach the word and we need,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.680
we request that you pray that the word of the Lord

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.720
would have free course.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.160
Now we know that the Lord Jesus Christ used

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.280
in the gospel records, the parable of the sower

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.520
went forth to sow seed, right?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.160
And the seed is the word of God.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.720
That's what the seed is, right?

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.560
The seed is never designed to be kept in the barn,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.900
by the way, the seed is to be sown.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.600
If you're a farmer, and I know none of us are,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.660
but if you know anything about farming,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.560
you don't keep the seed in the barn

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.460
throughout the time of planting.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.300
Why?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.760
Because you gotta get the seed into the ground

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.600
so that you can have a harvest.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.160
You don't keep the seed in the barn and then say,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.400
well, it's harvest time and where's all the produce?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.600
No, you didn't sow the seed.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.160
But the Bible tells us in that parable

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.760
that the enemy comes and tries to steal the seed.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.800
Is that not true?

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.360
It's what Jesus teaches us.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.160
So understand with me as we think about the entirety

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160
of this thought and how this, the apostle Paul

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.840
is saying to this group of believers, this local church,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.280
pray for us, and he says specifically in the second letter

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.960
that the word of the Lord may have free course

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.360
and be glorified even as it is with you.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.000
Remember what Paul said to the church in Corinth.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.880
He said this, that the gospel, if our gospel be hidden,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.320
is hidden to them that are lost.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.160
And then he says this, the God of the world

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.800
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.080
lest the light of the glorious gospel

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.880
should shine unto them.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.720
And so Paul understood this spiritual warfare

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.000
that was taking place as the sower goes out to plant seed.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.800
And so therefore, Paul understanding the truth

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.280
that he says to the church in Corinth

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.280
that some plant, some water, but God gives the increase.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.080
And so Paul says, I wanna get, I wanna enlist

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.140
as many people as I possibly can to pray

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.360
that God would bless the sowing of the seed

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.240
that God would use as we go forth.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.160
Paul says, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna preach,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.240
I'm gonna go to these cities,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.560
and I want you, church at Thessalonica, to pray.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.440
Now understand that Paul, not only understanding

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.800
the work that would be done

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.760
and understanding the spiritual warfare,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.220
turn over to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.200
in chapter number 11, and I want you to note quickly

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.480
some of what Paul records for the church in Corinth

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.280
that he had suffered, and some of what he endured

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.560
during his ministry, some of the affliction and hardship.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.600
And he begins to share this in 2 Corinthians,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.360
chapter number 11, and notice he says this.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.960
I begin in verse number 22.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.800
The Bible says, are they Hebrews?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.620
So am I.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.460
Are they Israelites?

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.300
So am I.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.200
Are they the seed of Abraham?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.040
So am I.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040
Are they ministers of Christ?

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.880
I speak as a fool.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.720
I am more.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.560
And then notice, he begins to get into this list.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.280
In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.440
in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.020
Of the Jews, five times received I 40 stripes, save one.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.480
You understand that they were taught

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.760
to be able to beat a man.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.040
Truly, they would use the phraseology

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.000
within an inch of their life.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.480
I mean, they mastered this cruel punishment

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.400
to take this whip and to whip the people

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.680
that they were trying to, in this case, Paul,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.800
who was not an evildoer or wrongdoer,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.800
because he was preaching the word, to whip him.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.640
Why?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.620
So that he'd stop.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.260
So he would no longer preach.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.980
And we find that he says this.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.340
Five times received I 40 stripes, save one.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.100
They said that would be 39 times.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.540
They say if you did it 40 times, you'd kill a man.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.420
They try to bring you as close to death as possible

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.460
without actually killing you,

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.860
so that you would refrain from doing

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.540
whatever it was that you were doing.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.060
Notice in verse number 25,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.860
thrice was I beaten with rods.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.340
Once was I stoned.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.820
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.740
A night and a day I've been in the deep.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.980
In journeyings often, in perils of waters,

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.820
in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.940
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.300
in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.860
in perils among false brethren,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.740
in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often,

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.260
in hunger and thirst, in fastings often,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.220
in cold and nakedness.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.900
I want you to think about all these things

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.540
that Paul mentions, and then he finishes up in verse 28,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.940
and he says, beside those things that are without,

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.240
that which cometh upon me daily,

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.440
the care of all the churches.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.180
And so Paul, he knows the battle,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.360
he knows what he's been facing,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.040
and so he says to the church in Thessalonica,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.920
here in 2 Thessalonians 3,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.960
we read in verse number one how that he made that request

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.620
that the word of the Lord would be glorified

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.600
and have free course, and be glorified even as is with you,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.040
but then in verse number two he says,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.520
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.660
and wicked men, for all men have not faith.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.740
Now, Paul understood something about the spiritual battle,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.280
spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.300
And so he says, brethren, pray for us.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.080
Brethren, pray for us.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.400
We're gonna go do the work,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.060
we're gonna go do what God has called us to do,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.420
and we want you to pray specifically

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.580
that the word of the Lord would have free course

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.340
and be glorified even as it is with you,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.080
but also pray because we're gonna face some opposition.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.440
We're gonna face some opposition.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.960
The apostle Paul made this statement as he's writing

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.480
to the believers in Corinth, he says this,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.160
that there is a great door in 1 Corinthians 16 and verse nine

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.799
for a great door and effectual is open unto me,

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:42.000
and there are many adversaries.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.160
But I want you to notice verse three

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.760
of 2 Thessalonians chapter three.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.119
It says, but the Lord is faithful.

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:52.820
Aren't you thankful that God is faithful?

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.700
Praise the Lord, we have a faithful God.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.980
He says, but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.140
and keep you from evil.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.940
The request of Paul is given,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.420
and I've mentioned much about it.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.059
I would say this, it really is a simple request, is it not?

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:15.580
Brethren, pray for us, and here is how I want you to pray.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.220
It's pretty simple.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.320
I would say this, it's a sincere request.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.500
I see the sincerity of Paul.

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:25.220
I understand that Paul, he knew in his own life

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.299
the importance of prayer.

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:29.900
He knew how important it was to involve

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.619
and to enlist others to be praying on his behalf,

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:37.739
and as they would go and do the work on the ground,

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.780
so to speak, that there were people

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.619
that were holding the ropes back at the other churches

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:44.220
and praying for them.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.299
I believe he was sincere in his request.

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:50.140
It was not just some kind of cliche,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.260
some kind of closing remarks that you would give

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.739
in a correspondence to an individual or to a church.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:58.980
Oh yeah, by the way, pray for me.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.340
No, this was a sincere.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.340
because he understood what prayer was.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.340
I note the request of Paul.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.340
I note the response of the people, number two.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.340
We find that the people seem to have responded by praying.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.340
It seems as if Paul had this confidence.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.340
Notice here in 2 Thessalonians 3 and verse number 4,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.340
the Bible says,

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.340
and we have confidence in the Lord touching you

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:29.340
that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.340
You know, it's an encouraging thing to know

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.340
that somebody's going to pray for you.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.340
It truly is.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.340
When Paul is writing in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.340
to this church in Thessalonica,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.340
he asks, he gives the request that they would pray,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.340
but even as he gives the request, he says to them,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.340
I have confidence.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.340
I have confidence in the Lord touching you

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.340
that you both do and will do the things which we command you.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.340
When you need prayer,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.340
I'm talking about one of those situations

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.340
where God brings a circumstance into your life

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.340
to teach you to pray when you need prayer.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.340
You know who you're going to ask to pray for you?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.340
Somebody that you believe prays.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.340
Am I right?

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.340
You're going to ask somebody that you believe

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.340
believes in prayer,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.340
that you believe they are a prayer warrior.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.340
We use that term sometimes.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.340
And you're going to go to them and you're going to say,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.340
would you pray for me?

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.340
You may be able to give them specifics.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.340
You may be able to outline for them why it is

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.340
that you need prayer about a specific situation,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.340
whatever that situation may be.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.340
It may be that you're not at liberty to be able to even say,

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.340
but you know, you have confidence

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.340
that they will bring the petition

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.340
before the all-knowing God

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.340
who can answer a prayer

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:53.340
that I don't even know the specifics of what I'm praying.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.340
You think about that just for a moment.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.340
There have been times in which we'll have prayer time

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.340
and we'll say, well, I don't know who the person was.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.340
I can't remember their name. I don't remember.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.340
God knows. You ever hear somebody say something like that?

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.340
Because God knows everything.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.340
And God knows.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.340
And somebody can come and say, would you,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.340
I can't tell you everything that's going on,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.340
but would you just pray?

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.340
Can I assure you tonight that God knows what's going on?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.340
And that God can answer that prayer

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.340
as you pray without having,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.340
you don't have to know.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.340
Because God knows.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.340
But you can still go before the throne of grace.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.340
Say, God, I don't know what that brother,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.340
that sister is dealing with.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.340
I don't know what the circumstance is.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.340
But God, I rest in knowing that you know,

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.340
and I pray that you'd work, that you would,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.340
and you can just begin to trust

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.340
how God will work.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.340
So this evening,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.340
as we think about this idea, brethren,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.340
pray for us in this request

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.340
and the response of the people

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.340
where Paul says, I have confidence

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.340
in the Lord touching you

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.340
and we both do and will do the things

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.340
which we command you.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.340
It's a blessing to know that people

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.340
are praying for you.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.340
I would say to you this evening,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.340
as we prepare for this missions

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.340
trip that we're taking,

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.340
that not only as your pastor,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.340
but as a spokesman, if I can, for the team

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.340
of folks that will be going to Panama,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.340
I believe that we would collectively

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.340
say to you, brethren,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.340
pray for us.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.340
Pray for us.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.340
This morning, we're not going on vacation.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.340
We really aren't. It's going to be a lot of ministry.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.340
And I'm excited about that.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.340
We're going to go down there.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.340
Brother Deal and the church,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.340
they have soul winning visitation

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.340
three times a week, four times a week.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.340
I mean, they're just busy trying to reach Panama

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.340
for Christ.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.340
And we're going to go down there

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.340
and we're going to be going out and we're going to be distributing literature.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.340
We're going to be talking to folks.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.340
We're going to just be knocking doors

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.340
and going into various communities

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.340
where they have bus routes that pick up

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.340
children on Sunday mornings and so on and so forth.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.340
We're going to be doing the ministry.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.340
I'm going to preach four times. I'm going to preach on Thursday night.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.340
They don't have a Wednesday night service. They have a Thursday night service.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.340
So I'll preach on Thursday night.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.340
Folks from our team

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.340
that are going will be teaching

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.340
every Sunday school class that they have on Sunday.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.340
They have six classes

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.340
and we'll have folks teaching.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.340
Actually, the nursery class, we won't have anyone teaching that class,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.340
but we'll be teaching all the other classes.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.340
And then during the junior church type

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.340
hour, they call it something different,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.340
a couple of folks from our group

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.340
will be teaching that age group

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.340
while I'm preaching in the morning service.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.340
We're going to be doing a lot of ministry

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.340
and I'm excited about that. That's what a missions trip should be.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.340
Going to do ministry.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.340
And so if I could give you

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.340
tonight some specifics

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.340
on how you can pray

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.340
for us.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.340
We see that the Apostle Paul,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.340
as he's endeavoring to go and serve

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.340
the Lord on this missionary journey

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.340
he's going and writing back to the church

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.340
at Thessalonica a group of people

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.340
that he knew, a group of people

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.340
that he believed prayed

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.340
and he's going to go to them and say,

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.340
would you pray for us in this manner?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.340
And so I'm going to say to you this evening,

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.340
would you pray for us in this manner?

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.340
Would you pray for us, number one, that we'd have safety?

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.340
Pray for our safety.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.340
And we're going to be flying. I know some of you like to fly.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.340
Some of you don't like to fly.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.340
We're going to fly and we trust that God would give us safety

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.340
as we fly down to Panama.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.340
We are thankful that we have direct flights

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.340
both to and from, but would you pray

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.340
for us? And would you pray

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.340
that God would give us safety while we're in the country?

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.340
As we're moving about

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.340
the country, as we're going from one location

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.340
to another location, as we're out

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.340
distributing literature and all those things.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.340
Here's what the Bible says. The Bible says

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.340
that the horse is prepared for the day of battle,

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.340
but safety is of the

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.340
Lord. And so when we talk about praying for

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.340
safety, I want you to pray for us.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.340
We've got a group of 11 of us going

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.340
and I'm not sure which one of us

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.340
in the group is the oldest. It doesn't really

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.340
matter. We've got a bunch of adults, but we've got all the way

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.340
down through Lucas is going with us.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.340
And so Lucas would be the youngest

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.340
and Lucas is how old? How old is

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.340
Lucas? Tim has no idea.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.340
Deanna, she doesn't know either.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.340
Lucas, he's 13.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.340
Lucas is 13. Thank you, Joseph.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.340
And he's got it, right? He's on the ball.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.340
And Lucas is 13, so he's the

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.340
youngest in our group. And we've got

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.340
some ladies that are going with us. It's not just

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.340
a group of men, so we've got ladies that are going with us.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.340
And so you pray for our safety.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.340
Pray that God would give us unity.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.340
That God would give us unity.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.340
You know, the enemy would love

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.340
to cause our group to be

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.340
at odds one with another.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.340
The enemy would love that. Why?

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.340
Because if we're so divided and we're

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.340
kind of having issues amongst our group, guess

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.340
what? We're not going to be very effective in ministry.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.340
That's why the devil is always trying to

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.340
cause disunity in the house

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.340
of God. Because if we're,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.340
listen, if the church

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.340
at Corinth is so focused on fighting

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.340
amongst themselves, guess what they're not doing?

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.340
They're not reaching the city of

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.340
Corinth with the gospel.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.340
That's what's happening, because they're all internal.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.340
They're all looking at what's going on and having

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.340
these I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas, I'm of Apollos,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.340
so on and so forth. Pray for our health.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.340
Pray for our health. If you've ever

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.340
traveled internationally,

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.340
you know that there are some things

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.340
that could potentially pop up as

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.340
health concerns. And Panama

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.340
is a relatively developed

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.340
country, but it is not

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.340
where we live and where we

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.340
consume the

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.340
goods and what have you. So we've always got to be

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.340
careful with consuming water and products that

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.340
are washed and so on and so forth. But pray that God

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.340
will give us health. And why do I pray for all

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.340
those things? Well, really I ask

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.340
you to pray for those things to really lead up

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.340
to the main thing, and that is for the ministry

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.340
opportunities. Listen,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.340
if we don't have safety, we're not going to be able

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.340
to have the ministry opportunities. If we don't have

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.340
the unity, we're not going to have the

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.340
ministry opportunities. If we don't have the health, we're not

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.340
going to have the ministry opportunities.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.340
And so as we have these ministry opportunities

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.340
of distributing

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.340
John and Romans, distributing gospel

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.340
tracts, going door to door, teaching,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.340
preaching, singing, ministering

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.340
music. I'm not doing the singing and music

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.340
part, but we'll be doing all of

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.340
that. We're going to serve the Lord

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.340
and we're going to be a blessing.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.340
We're going to be a blessing not only to Brother Deal and to

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.340
his church family, or to

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.340
his family and to his church family, but we understand

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.340
that there are going to be

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.340
according to what Brother Deal

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.340
is expecting, there are going to be a lot

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.340
of first-time visitors this Sunday

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.340
when we will be there on the 15th of

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.340
September. Here's what they're doing.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.340
Today was week three of their, what

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.340
they call a fall campaign. Now it's not

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.340
fall in Panama. They don't really

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.340
have seasons like we have

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.340
as far as the

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.340
time of year where it is there. They have,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.340
according to Brother Deal, they have the wet season and the dry

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.340
season. And the wet season is from March

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.340
to December, so that's pretty much almost the

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.340
entire year. And so they're

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.340
in the midst of the wet season,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.340
but during this time of year they have a

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.340
four-week Sunday school push.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.340
And through this Sunday school push they

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.340
offer to the children and to the adults

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.340
as well various objectives,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.340
being able to earn points and what have you,

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.340
and memorizing

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.340
verses, bringing visitors,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.340
you fill in the blank. And they do

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.340
this and they have this

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.340
four-week concentrated effort

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.340
that they have in their church.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.340
And so next Sunday will be the fourth

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.340
week. And therefore

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.340
they will have a number of things that will be going on

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.340
where children will receive

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.340
prizes and be able to use

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.340
the points that they've earned to be able to

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.340
participate in a variety of things. And so therefore

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.340
it's the last day, so they're

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.340
expecting the biggest number

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.340
of people in attendance. He told

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.340
me that he would not

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.340
be surprised if we had 50 to

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.340
75 first-time visitors.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.340
That's a lot of visitors.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.340
And here's what he asked me.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.340
We're all going to teach the same lesson

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.340
for Sunday school. And he said,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.340
Preacher, would you write the message

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.340
and would you make it as

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.340
clear and simple the gospel

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.340
as possible because we want to give

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.340
the gospel and see souls saved.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.340
So would you pray that souls would be saved?

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.340
Would you pray that they would be open and receptive?

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.340
I have a lesson that we're going to

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.340
teach. It's already been given to all those that will

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.340
be teaching in our group.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.340
What must I do

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.340
to be saved?

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.340
Is that not a simple passage of

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.340
scripture?

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.740
I do to be saved, and I will be teaching that during the Sunday school hour, and then I'll

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.500
be preaching in the morning service about the gift of God, which is the eternal life,

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.980
and there'll be a number of people in the morning service that won't be there for the

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.260
Sunday school hour, and so we're looking forward to that, and I trust that you would pray that

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.260
souls would be saved.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.140
I'm thankful that God is still saving souls.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.700
I'm thankful that He is still able to save, amen, that He said, listen, the promise of

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.560
Romans 10, 13 is as true today as it ever has been, for whosoever shall call upon the

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.920
name of the Lord shall be saved, and so I want you to pray that souls would be saved.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.720
Would you pray that God's power would rest upon us?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.980
Here's the reality.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.880
Without Him, we can do nothing.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.560
Without Him, we can do nothing.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.560
By the way, without Him, you can do nothing.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.040
We need Him.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.160
We need Him, and I want to ask you to pray.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:03.200
This is our first church-wide, under my leadership as the pastor, missions trip that we'll be

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.200
taking.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:10.680
I've gone on my own to Mexico, and I've done some other things, missions related, but this

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.240
is the first trip that's opened up to the church family being invited and interested

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240
in being able to go.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240
We've got 11 people going.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.240
I'm excited about that.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.360
I'm excited about that, and I hope that God does something in our hearts and our lives.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360
I want you to pray to that way.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.800
I want you to pray that God stirs us, that it's not just a, yep, we went on a missions

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.480
trip, but that God truly does something in our hearts, and then what's going to happen

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.720
is we're going to come back, and it's going to do something in your hearts, do something

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.400
in your life.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.760
If you're praying, as I'm asking you to, then on Sunday night, the 22nd of September, you'll

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:50.040
be able to rejoice as we give an update as to what God did and how God heard your prayers

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:56.080
and how God answered your prayers, and you'll be vested in that.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.400
What a great opportunity that God would give us.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.640
I'm going to give you very quickly the names of the folks that are going.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.880
Some of you know already, but some of you do not know.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.200
So I'm going, Holly's going, Brianna and Joseph, the four of us are going, and then there are

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:19.240
three Trejos that are going, Armando, Tim, and Lucas, those three, and then we have Brother

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.640
Jeff is going with us, and then we have Ms. Erica, Ms. Jennifer, and Ms. Lena, all right?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.000
So there's going to be 11 of us that are going, and we're looking forward to it, but we know

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.680
that we need you to pray.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.920
I know that we need you to pray, and I speak not only as your pastor, but I speak as a

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:45.080
representative of the group, brethren, pray for us, and if you would, listen, we could

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.960
add so many things on how you could pray specifically, but I just give you those few

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.760
thoughts tonight.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.600
If you would pray specifically, pray fervently, I'm not going to ask you to make a commitment

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.320
to me, I'm going to ask you to make a commitment to God, that you would pray for us each day

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.760
that we're there.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.560
We leave Tuesday morning, our flight leaves at 9.30, Lord willing, and it's a direct flight,

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.760
we'll get down there, it's an hour behind us in time, it's a five-hour flight, we'll

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.440
get there at 1.30 local time, and we'll be heading back on the 16th, which is Monday,

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.520
we fly back late Monday night, early Tuesday morning, we land technically on the 17th at

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.080
12.30 in the morning, and so you pray that God gives us a wonderful week of ministry,

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.040
and we look forward to hearing not only what God does here, but I look forward to being

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:34.440
able to share with you what God does in the country of Panama through the group from Fellowship

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.680
Baptist Church that's going to go.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.000
Ron, you got a question?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Repeat the names.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:46.600
So the four of us, three Trejos, Armando, Tim, and Lucas, and then Brother Jeff, Miss

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.440
Erica, Miss Lena, and Miss Jennifer.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440
All right?

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.800
All right, let's pray together.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.800
Father, we love you, we thank you for loving us, thank you for your word, God, I thank

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.280
you for the Apostle Paul, and I thank you for the ministry that you used him to accomplish,

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.880
but we understand several things.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.200
Number one, he was yielded and surrendered to you, he followed your voice and your direction,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.600
but number two, there was an army of people praying for him, and God, I pray that you

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:17.280
would help us to acknowledge this evening the importance of prayer, and Father, that

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.800
we would make a commitment to you, Lord, that we would pray.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.480
I pray, Father, that you would watch over the group that goes, that you would use us

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.640
for your honor and for your glory, that your power would rest upon us, Lord, that you would

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:36.640
give us unique ministry opportunities, that we'd see souls saved, lives changed, I pray

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.440
God that you'd give us health and safety and unity, I pray God that you would be glorified,

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.760
that you would do a work in our hearts over this next week, I pray for our church family,

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.120
Lord, I pray that you'd watch over them and use them, I pray that even as we go to a foreign

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.840
country to minister, that even as we minister daily, as we have those opportunities, I pray

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.720
that you'd use our church family, and God, I pray for Pastor Aylstock, as he'll be filling

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.840
the pulpit, I pray God that you'd use him, I pray that our folks would be encouraged,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:14.000
and God, I pray that you'd work in a distinct way that we would have the opportunity on

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
a couple of Sundays from now to come together as a church family and to rejoice greatly,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.560
to glorify you for all that you'll do, God, we believe that you want to work, we believe

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.160
that you're able to work, and I pray that you'd simply use us, that God, you'd be glorified,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.760
we'll give you all the honor, it's due unto your name, it's in Christ's name we pray.
