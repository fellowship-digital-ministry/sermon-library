WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119
So we've enjoyed our time here, enjoyed the good weather

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:03.319
we had the first couple of days,

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:04.920
and praise the Lord for the rain out there.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.519
It's good to see the rain.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:08.279
We got a lot of rain in California this year.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.119
It ended our drought.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.680
We thank God for that because we were really

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.000
in serious drought conditions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.239
So we're glad that the Lord blessed us this past year

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.000
and answered prayer, and we saw a lot of rain out there,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
so we were glad for that.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.319
Well, just a quick introduction.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:22.280
I'm Paul Mershon.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm from Mira Mesa Bible Baptist Church

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.239
in the beautiful city of San Diego.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.280
In fact, our motto is America's Finest City.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.760
We agree with that.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.360
So we love our city.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.919
We live north of the city up in the foothills,

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:36.439
almost 1,000 feet, and we love where we live.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.040
We're in an orange grove, a couple acres,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.520
and it's quiet up there, and we got the coyotes

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.919
and rattlesnakes and the bobcats

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:43.360
and all the rest of that run around up there,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.080
but we love it up there.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.639
It's a real blessing to live in that area

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:49.119
of Southern California.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.680
My wife and I, Linda, we've been married 58 years now.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.799
We have one daughter, just one child,

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.880
and she has five, and they're all adults, now all married.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.479
We have 14 great-grandchildren.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.319
Praise the Lord for that, amen?

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.639
And you say, now, Brother Mershon,

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.440
you don't look old enough to have 14 great-grandchildren.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.959
Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.760
Praise the Lord.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.720
We got married young.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.000
I was 10 and she was eight.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.720
And we did get married young,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.760
and we tend to do that in our family.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.080
Why, I don't know, but we do, and we're glad we did.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.800
So Linda and I have been partners in life and ministry

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.959
all these years, and I thank God for my precious wife.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.360
She's a blessing to me.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.480
She travels everywhere with me.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.239
I don't take meetings unless she goes.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.319
She has to come with me,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.440
and I don't want to be without my wife,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.559
so I thank the Lord for her,

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.360
and she's been a blessing all these years.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.639
She takes care of the finances.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.720
She takes care of scheduling my meetings, amen?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.400
She washes my clothes.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.120
She cooks my meals.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.040
Praise the Lord, amen?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.040
That's a good thing, eh?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.879
Aren't you glad?

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.080
I mean, she does all that for me,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.239
and I just can't get, when we were pulling the RV,

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.519
I couldn't get her to pull the RV.

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.120
She wouldn't drive the truck, so I had to do all that,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.319
but I praise the Lord for her.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.040
We're from Miriam Mason Bible Baptist Church

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.440
in San Diego.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.919
My pastor's Willie Dale.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.160
We're a Filipino church.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.519
You notice I'm not Filipino,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.480
but we have worked with Filipino people for years.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.800
I spent a lot of time in the Philippine Islands

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.520
and fell in love with the Filipino people

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.199
and the Philippines itself.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.199
If God allowed me to be a missionary down there,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.440
I would have been there years ago,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.199
but God's never given me permission

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.479
to do mission work in the Philippines.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.000
We've been back down there and preached

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and been in several churches in the Philippines.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.080
There's a major moving of God going on

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.360
in the 7,043 islands of that great country.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.279
The population now is getting close to 100 million people.

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.360
Now, that country is being evangelized in a great way,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.399
and we thank God for that.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.759
So the Filipino people now,

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.240
there's a lot of independent Baptist churches

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.600
that have been established in the country.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.440
They've got Bible colleges going on, Bible institutes,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.960
and they're planning mission works all over the world

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.479
out of the Philippines.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.800
And they say in the next five years,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.199
they'll be the greatest missionary sending nation

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.320
on the face of the earth.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.160
They have missionaries there.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.320
You can go anywhere in the world, you'll find Filipinos.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.800
My pastor was recently in the Middle East,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.320
and he was preaching in underground churches there

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.520
in Dubai and Bahrain, Bahrain, and then was up in Italy.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.039
And he said, man, there's Filipino churches

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.559
because there's a lot of Filipinos

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.520
that are working in the Middle East.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.600
And they go in there and they plant churches.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.199
And so we're thankful for what they're doing.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.199
We love our pastor.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.960
We love our church family.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.080
He's getting ready to retire.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.399
We have a new young man that's come in.

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.119
We think he's gonna be taking the church.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.960
We're glad for that

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.119
because he's just a really good young fellow.

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.960
So we're excited about what God is doing.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.240
So we're glad to be with you, amen.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.399
And we appreciate you.

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.759
I want you to know right from the very beginning,

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.639
we love you and we care about you

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.440
and we care about your pastor and his family.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.119
As he said, I was his pastor at one time.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.080
He just had brother Derrick Thomas here.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.320
I was his pastor also.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.160
One time I was ascending pastor when he went to Lithuania.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.679
Now, of course, he's working in Ukraine

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.119
with Slavic Baptist missions there,

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.240
Slavic Baptist Institute.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.160
So brother Derrick and I are close friends.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.720
So I'm glad he was here and able to share with you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.759
what God's doing there in Ukraine.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.960
Take your Bible and turn with me to,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.080
if you will, please, Jeremiah chapter 33.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.039
Now, I'm not going to preach out of this chapter.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.520
I'm gonna go back to the New Testament,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.639
but I want you to look at Jeremiah chapter 33

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.639
as we begin this revival meeting.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.359
This may be one of the most important statements I make

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.519
at the beginning of this meeting.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.079
I'm gonna be sharing a lot of different things

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.920
with you through the week,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.640
but this is one of the most important statements

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.079
I can possibly make as we begin this meeting.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.640
I see this as an imperative,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.760
what I'm gonna share with you right now.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.760
This is a revival meeting imperative.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.399
In Jeremiah chapter 33,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.559
a familiar portion of scripture says this,

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.320
beginning in verse one,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.320
"'Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.119
the second time while he was yet shut up

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:42.480
in the court of the prison, saying,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.640
thus saith the Lord, the maker thereof,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.239
the Lord that formed it to establish it,

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:49.359
the Lord is his name.'"

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.799
Now look at verse 33, it says,

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:54.000
"'Call,' it says, "'call unto me,

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.799
and I will answer thee.'"

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.000
Now listen, when God answers,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.359
He may say yes, no, or wait.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.320
Did you ever think about that when you pray?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.119
Sometimes God will say yes and answer the prayer.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:13.200
Sometimes He'll say no, and sometimes He'll say wait.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.559
But I guarantee you, God's gonna answer prayer

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.239
one way or the other.

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:20.799
And we sure wanna see God answer prayer this week.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.720
So He said, "'Call unto me, and I will,'

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.000
that's a great promise of scripture,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.320
"'I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty works

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.559
or mighty things which thou knowest not.'"

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.000
Now the word there, call, in verse three,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.839
is an interesting word.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.399
It's a Hebrew word, kora, and it means this.

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.640
It means to cry out, to cry for help,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.679
to utter a loud sound, or to plead.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040
So God's literally saying here,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.440
I want you to plead with me.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.559
I want you to call out to me.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.720
I want you to cry out.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.239
I want you to cry out in a distinct and definite manner.

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:55.200
I need to hear from you.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.600
And I guarantee you, you're gonna hear from me, amen?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600
And notice He said, listen, He said,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.000
"'Once again, call unto me, and I will answer thee

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600
"'and show thee great and mighty things.'"

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.519
That word mighty there, if you were to consider

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:10.320
what was synonymous with it, be the word supernatural.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.260
And supernatural things which thou knowest not.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.100
God does supernatural things.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.059
We serve a powerful God, would you agree?

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:22.579
And I thank God for that.

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:25.700
Now let me say this, God is only limited by our unbelief.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.739
The only thing that limits God's working is our unbelief.

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.339
Now I'll tell you what, I'm believing God for revival.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.739
Now God can only send revival if we plead with Him for it.

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:41.019
And what I say in Sunday school,

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:42.739
we have to meet the requirements to have revival

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.380
if my people which are called by my name

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:46.540
will humble themselves and pray and seek my face

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.459
and turn from their wicked ways.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.179
Those four prerequisites must be met by God's people.

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:52.700
Leave any one of them out,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.459
and we're not going to see revival.

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.059
So God puts it on us.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.459
God says, if you will, I will.

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.779
You see that in Malachi chapter three,

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.579
God said, if you will, I will.

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.940
And then sometimes I think God says, you first.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.179
You go first.

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.019
Now we don't respond to God that way,

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:13.899
there's not much you can do.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.420
Now Lord, listen, I want to come before you

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.500
and I want to humble myself.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.779
I want to come broken.

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:20.980
Lord, I want to humble myself before you,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.899
I want to come broken.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:23.940
I don't want to hide anything,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.100
don't want to cover anything up,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.299
I don't want to hold anything back.

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:28.600
I want to come and I just want to come broken.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.260
I want to humble myself before you.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.380
I'm going to seek you in prayer.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.140
I'm going to bow myself before you.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.660
And oh, and I'm going to turn from my wicked ways.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.179
It's an amazing thing that God says that to his own people,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.380
the children of Israel, and he says the same thing to us.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.739
He said, and sometimes people say,

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:49.420
that doesn't go down well with me, but it's what God said.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.579
I'm not going to change the word of God.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:52.859
God wrote it, I quoted, he said,

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:55.140
you need to turn from your wicked ways.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.179
Anything that's in violation of God's word is wicked.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.140
Any sin that we commit against God is wicked.

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.179
Amen.

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:09.619
And God says, you know what, you know, folks,

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.339
you just need to realize the importance

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:12.660
of meeting these prerequisites.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.779
And I'm more than willing to open up the windows of heaven

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:16.739
and pour out a blessing and a great blessing

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:20.059
if you would just meet the requirements from the heart.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:21.779
It just goes through the motions on the outside.

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:23.380
I've seen people do that.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.299
I've seen a lot of people come to the altar and make decisions.

00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:28.660
Their heart was stirred in the message,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.739
but they weren't changed.

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:32.179
They get up from the altar, walked out the door,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.580
they weren't out the door 20 minutes,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.299
and the devil stole from their breast,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.739
stole from their heart that which the Holy Spirit

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:40.340
had accomplished during the course of the meetings.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.700
So we need to be honest with God this week

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.940
and come clean with him.

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:50.020
I don't bring revival.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.059
I'm just a servant of the King.

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:54.059
I'm just the sorriest preacher God ever had,

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.539
but I give it my best shot, I'll tell you that.

00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:58.820
Just preach what God wants us to hear.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.700
I need to hear it too.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.700
I want you to understand that I don't preach anything here

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.619
this week that I don't need myself.

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:07.539
So we need to be all prepared.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.460
The preparation of the heart is so important for us.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.460
That's why I'm glad the pastor has prayer here

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.619
before the service tonight,

00:09:14.619 --> 00:09:16.820
and we had prayer this morning

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.099
before we got into the activities of the morning service,

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:21.700
and we'll have prayer through the week,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.619
but you need to make sure that you spend time

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:25.179
with the Lord alone by yourself

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:27.900
and have that secret time with him.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.020
I remember many years ago,

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.059
we had a nationally known preacher

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:35.780
came to our church in Temecula, California,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.340
and I knew he was coming,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.419
and a couple months out before he got there,

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:41.539
at least it was a month and a half,

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.099
maybe two months before he got there,

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:45.020
I just spent some time with the Lord,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.659
and I said, listen, when he's here,

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:50.900
I want you to speak to my heart through that brother.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.539
And I started preparing my heart,

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:55.500
and I just needed help.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.219
And he came, and I'll tell you what,

00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:00.719
that brother hadn't opened his mouth and wasn't in,

00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:07.319
in the pulpit 15 minutes, and the Holy Spirit of God fell on me. And he was there with us,

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:12.619
I think, two or three days. And throughout the entire time he was with us, every message

00:10:12.619 --> 00:10:16.499
he preached, I mean, God just took that message and just absolutely and positively cleaned

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:24.879
me out. And that's what God wants to do. We have to meet with Him, and we have to do business

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:30.759
with Him. So I'm praying that this week as we gather together here in the house of God

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:35.559
that we'll be prepared when we come, that our hearts are prepared. Now you know what

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:40.039
God says, two times He says this in the Old Testament, He said, listen, break up your

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:44.119
fallow ground. God won't break it up, we have to break it up. That's my responsibility.

00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:50.519
God says, break up your fallow ground. So in other words, fallow ground is ground that

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:55.359
is not being used, and it's fallow, it's not being, nothing's growing on it, but it's

00:10:55.359 --> 00:11:00.299
still pliable, it's still able to be used, you can still plant in it, you can still get

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:05.399
some fruit out of it, but you have to break it up. Just like the farmer breaks up the

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:09.559
ground when he gets ready to plant. God said, you need to break up your fallow ground so

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.559
I can sow the seed of gospel truth in your heart. I can sow the seed of my word in your

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:18.239
heart so that it can accomplish something and it can bear fruit. So we need to break

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:25.519
up our fallow ground this week. Amen. Hebrews chapter 11, please, or Hebrews chapter 10

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:29.239
rather. Hebrews chapter 10 in your Bible this morning in verse 37, one verse we're going

00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:32.999
to look at here, then we'll get into the message and we'll look at some more scripture along

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:39.599
the way. Hebrews chapter 10 in verse 37, it's a wonderful little verse of scripture. I'm

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:43.039
going to start with that today because every time I read through it, it just excites me

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:48.919
and I'm going to show you in a minute why. Hebrews chapter 10 in verse 37. When you arrive

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:51.719
there, if you can, if you will, please, would you stand with me, please, out of respect

00:11:51.719 --> 00:11:55.279
and reverence, regard for the infallible and inspired and earned word of God preserved

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:00.359
for us in English language and the old King James Bible. Amen. Hebrews chapter 10 in verse

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:03.339
37, I'll read, you can follow with me, then we'll pray and get into the message God has

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:09.879
for us this morning. Here in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 37, I see this. Now take note of

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:14.599
this for yet a little while. Now this was written 2000 years ago. You know, back in

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:18.439
that day, they were looking for the soon return of the Lord Jesus. They were looking for the

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:22.479
outtaking of the saints. They were looking for the trump of God, the shout of the archangel

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:26.999
and the cry, come up hither. They were looking for the rapture. Do you know, or you realize

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:30.399
this morning, beloved, there's not one single prophecy needs to be fulfilled in order for

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:35.319
the Lord Jesus to come back and rapture us out of here. Amen. Now I'm not looking for

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:38.279
the undertaker. I'm looking for the upper taker. You've heard that before, but I'm saying

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.639
it again. I'm not looking for the undertaker. I'm looking for the upper taker. Now I don't

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:46.199
have much time left in the earth at my age, so I'm trusting that perhaps He'll come in

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:50.319
the next couple of days. Maybe He'll come this morning before we get out of here. Every

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:54.239
morning I get up, I say, maybe even today. Every morning, the prayer of my heart is the

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:58.519
last prayer of the Bible. Even so, come Lord Jesus. I don't know about you, but I'm excited

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:04.199
about His coming. We were talking about that this morning. He said, for yet a little while,

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:10.879
and he that shall come will come. Now let's see this, and will not tarry. And will not

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:16.119
tarry. Now, friends, listen. One of the most precious doctrines of the Bible is the doctrine

00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:21.319
of imminency. I believe in the imminent, the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ. It can

00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:25.559
be at any time. Everybody says, well, you have to meet certain world conditions in order

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:31.639
for Him to come back. No, you don't. Everything's all in place already. Amen. Now we know there's

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:35.439
a lot of prophecy. We can look at the Bible. We can see that there's prophecy that's starting

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:39.759
to, the precursors are starting to show up on the scene that is indicative of the tribulation

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:45.039
hour. By the way, I'm not going to be here. How about you? I'm pre-tribulational, man.

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:48.599
I'm out of here, man. You want to stay for mid-trib, post-trib, up yourself. But man,

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:52.759
I'll tell you what, at the trumping shout, I'm gone, praise the Lord. And you're in trouble

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:57.679
if you aren't going with me. So when I look at this, I think, well, you know what? We

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:02.079
always say the same thing. We say it over and over again. Well, the Lord tarries. Well,

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:04.999
we got to do this, the Lord tarries. I'm going to have you sit in a minute. Well, we're going

00:14:04.999 --> 00:14:07.079
to go ahead and we're going to do that, and the Lord tarries. We're going to get into

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.959
a building program, but the Lord tarries. Well, we're going to go do this, and the Lord

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:14.759
tarries. I'm going to tell you what, friends, the Bible says He's not going to tarry. Jesus

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:20.039
is coming right on schedule. And when the Father, one day the Father is going to turn

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:33.399
to His Son, He's going to say, Son, go get your children. Son, go get your children.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:44.399
And it'll be worth it all when we see Jesus. When the battle's over, we shall wear a crown

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:49.359
in the new Jerusalem. I just think about that every day. I think, Lord, even today, maybe

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:55.799
today, Lord, even today, I'm weary of this world. Oh, God. Someone said to me, listen,

00:14:55.799 --> 00:15:00.319
you Christians just won't look for the rapture to get out of here. I said, amen. That's good

00:15:00.319 --> 00:15:04.839
for me, and I hope it's good for you. Father, we thank You for Your precious Word this morning,

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:10.159
and what a tremendous, wonderful truth we've just seen in this one verse. And God, we're

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:14.359
glad that You're not going to tarry. We are thankful that Jesus is coming soon. We're

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:19.039
glad for that. And, Lord, I pray that it might even be today. We may not even finish

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:24.079
this service. I'd rejoice if You came this morning. So, Lord, speak to our hearts this

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:28.679
morning. Help me as I try to share Your Word. Help me to rightly divide the Word of truth.

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:32.719
It's going to be a simple message, but yet it's so needed. It's, I need it this morning.

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:37.259
I pray You'd speak to all of us. So, God, I pray now as we look into Your Word, bless

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:41.759
our time together. Fill me with Thy Spirit, God, anoint my lips, and might You be glorified

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:46.319
and honored in all that's said and done. We'll thank You for it in Jesus' name. Amen.

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:54.119
Thank you. You may be seated.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.519
In John chapter 2, if you want to turn there, I'm going to probably just read some Scripture

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:02.679
so you don't have to do a lot of turning. But in John chapter 2, I'm going to show you

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:06.359
a couple of things here, and we're going to move on to some other Scripture as well. But

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:09.359
before I look at this, John chapter 2, we're going to look down to the bottom portion of

00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:13.279
this and then chapter 3.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:20.079
Back in the 1970s, there was a revival spirit going on in America. Now, I don't know how

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:23.199
many of you were saved during that time and were around. Some of you were maybe even in

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:28.239
this church during that time. I noticed this church was established in 1958, so this church

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:32.399
has been around for a while. And some of you may have been here, maybe even in the late

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:38.739
50s, early 60s. I don't know. I don't know when you became part of this congregation.

00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:44.019
But many of you that are here that are my age probably can remember that in the 70s

00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:47.859
we had some kind of a revival spirit going on in our churches here in America. We especially

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:53.699
saw it in California. And we saw churches being planted. We would have revival meetings.

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.179
We'd have churches from all over the area would come and support each other's revival

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:01.979
meetings. We'd fill up auditoriums. I mean, I'm talking about the overflowing. I can remember

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:05.739
having seven, eight, nine churches gather together in the old Palm Road Baptist Church

00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:10.059
in Poway, California. We'd put about 1,000 people in there for a revival meeting. And

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:16.179
I mean, they'd come every night. We had a citywide crusade in San Diego. Average attendant,

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:19.939
every single night, the average attendant, this was all independent Baptist churches

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:24.219
like this one here supporting that meeting. Every single night we had an average between

00:17:24.219 --> 00:17:29.259
7,500 to 9,000 people in those meetings. Now I'm not just talking about numbers. I'm talking

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:33.559
about a spirit, a moving of the Spirit of God in those days where we saw a lot of people

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:38.159
get saved. I can remember in the church that we were members in, I was a youth director

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:44.799
there, first youth director in that church. It was started in 1973. And by 1975, 76, the

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:50.079
building was packed. And I cannot remember a Sunday when somebody did not walk the aisle

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:54.959
in that church and get saved. I don't remember a week when we had a church member or church

00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:58.839
members bring people to church and walk the aisle with them to make a public profession

00:17:58.839 --> 00:18:02.319
of faith that had been saved during the week because the church members were leading them

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:08.119
to Christ. I can't remember a Sunday when we didn't baptize. Well, friends, that's all

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:15.259
changed. Something happened in the 80s. It was like a switch got flipped. And I've noticed

00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:20.479
that over the years, and this is my own personal opinion, maybe you've seen something different,

00:18:20.479 --> 00:18:24.399
but over the years there's been a whole lot less rapture preaching than we used to have

00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:29.559
in the 70s. Man, we were preaching on the rapture, I mean, all the time. You heard rapture

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:35.799
preaching everywhere you went. It seemed like people were ready. They were excited about,

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:41.879
they were enthusiastic about the soon return of Jesus. And we were here and preaching on

00:18:41.879 --> 00:18:46.639
that. We would have prophecy conferences. We'd have at least one or two of them a year

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:52.119
in our church, our little church in Escondido, California. And we were looking for something

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:56.319
to happen. Now today we just kind of settled on our leaves and we just kind of settled

00:18:56.319 --> 00:19:01.159
into churchianity and we just are kind of satisfied with where we're at. And listen,

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:04.839
friends, we ought never be satisfied with where we are.

00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:08.559
Now someone said to me, now, Brother Meshon, this sounds like a real downer to me. It sounds

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:12.079
like it's a real negative. No, it's not at all, because I still believe with all my heart

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:16.599
and soul that we can still experience revival in the household of faith in these last days.

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:24.159
Wouldn't it be wonderful when Jesus came back, He found us on fire? Amen. Let me say this.

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:27.839
If this church caught on fire for the Lord, and this is a good church, by the way, you're

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:32.839
sweet people. So I'm not, this is not a condemnatory statement. If that church were to catch on

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:38.679
fire and the word got out, the whole town want to show up and watch you burn. We had

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:45.159
that happen in Baghdad, Arizona 20 or some years ago. We had revival break out in a little

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:49.839
town of Baghdad, Arizona. It's a mining town. And there were seven churches in that little

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:55.759
town of 5,500. Now they weren't all Baptist churches, but they heard about the revival

00:19:55.759 --> 00:20:00.679
that broke out there. On Wednesday night, the whole town showed up.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:03.179
to see what was going on.

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:04.019
Remember that?

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.879
The whole town showed up.

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:06.719
Everybody came.

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:08.519
They shut down their midweek service

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:11.559
and they all showed up for our revival meeting.

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:12.759
And I said, well, praise the Lord, man.

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.559
We got a crowd here tonight.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:17.039
I mean to tell you, God was moving and God was working

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.799
in a supernatural, powerful way.

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:21.379
I've seen this with my own eyes.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.959
And I had nothing to do with it, man.

00:20:23.959 --> 00:20:25.239
I just preached the word and stepped back

00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:26.779
and watched God do something.

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:29.539
And that thing went on.

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:31.239
I mean, it went all week long.

00:20:32.139 --> 00:20:34.339
Do you know that church had prayer meetings

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:36.699
and shift change time?

00:20:36.699 --> 00:20:38.019
When they would change shift,

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:41.459
those miners would work 12 hours on, 12 hours off

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.899
in that copper mine.

00:20:43.899 --> 00:20:45.179
And when they would change shifts,

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:46.739
they'd have prayer meeting.

00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:49.019
So the shift going on would have prayer meeting,

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:50.179
go to work, the shift coming off,

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:51.019
come have prayer meeting.

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:53.499
They did that for two or three months.

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:54.539
I mean, I went over and joined with them.

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:55.379
He got there early.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.659
These men were on their knees pleading with God

00:20:57.659 --> 00:20:58.539
to do something.

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:00.339
And he did.

00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:05.139
And I said, man, it's almost like a reset back to the 70s.

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:09.539
Now, this was not a great awakening going on in America

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:11.139
at that time because we hadn't really had

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:13.499
a great awakening throughout the entire 20th century.

00:21:13.499 --> 00:21:17.339
No great awakenings like the first and second

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:19.059
great awakening took place in the 20th century.

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:22.299
God was not pleased to send revival to America

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:24.759
in the 20th century on a large scale.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:27.279
But we were seeing these little pockets

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.639
of revival going on.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.559
And everybody's preaching on the rapture.

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.759
Well, I think people, when it didn't happen,

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.359
I think people got discouraged.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.159
I said, why are you discouraged?

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:40.999
You shouldn't be discouraged.

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:42.319
He's coming.

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:44.839
He's just not coming on your time schedule.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:49.519
He's not operating on your clock.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.919
He's operating on his schedule.

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:52.519
He's operating on his clock.

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.679
And when he's ready to snatch us out of here,

00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:56.799
he's coming back.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:57.759
Now, here's my question.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.359
I'm gonna move into this message a little bit more.

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.199
Here's my question.

00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:01.039
Are you ready?

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.239
I mean, are you ready?

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:04.999
I'm just saying this.

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:05.819
Are you saved?

00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:07.359
Are you ready?

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.959
You don't wanna get left behind.

00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:13.359
I guarantee you, you don't wanna get left behind.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:16.879
But now listen, now, if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:18.119
if you're washed in the blood of the Lamb,

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:19.879
the question's still very relevant.

00:22:19.879 --> 00:22:20.839
Are you ready?

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:23.599
If Jesus were to come today

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:28.519
and give us that glorified body,

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:29.599
amen, boy, think about that.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.799
We'll see that in a minute.

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:33.079
If he were to come today,

00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:35.519
and you were to stand before him,

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:37.839
in what spiritual shape would you be in?

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.439
Would he find you waiting?

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:44.039
Would he find you looking?

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:47.639
Would he find you living clean?

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:49.679
Would he find you living pure?

00:22:49.959 --> 00:22:51.759
Would he find you living holy?

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:53.559
Would he find you living separated?

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:56.359
Sanctified and consecrated?

00:22:56.359 --> 00:22:59.399
Or would he find you living worldly?

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.519
Listen, the Bible says those who live godly in Christ Jesus

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:06.959
will suffer persecution, not the worldly.

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.759
One of the reasons the devil leave people alone today,

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.679
I'm talking about saved people,

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:10.799
the reason the devil leaves you alone

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.879
is because you're living for the world, not for Christ.

00:23:12.879 --> 00:23:14.279
And the devil leave you alone because,

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.359
listen, let me tell you this right now,

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:18.199
the devil's not interested in messing around with you

00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:20.239
if you're not living for Jesus.

00:23:20.239 --> 00:23:22.959
He loves it when you're not living for the Lord.

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:24.479
You start living for him, I guarantee,

00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:27.000
the devil ain't gonna like it, he's coming after you.

00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:30.039
I get concerned if he doesn't.

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.239
I gotta say, Lord, what's going on with me?

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:34.719
Am I missing something here?

00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:38.199
It's not that I'm inviting his attacks and his persecution,

00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:39.559
it's just I know that it's coming

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:41.519
if I'm gonna live for him.

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:42.599
Then we have to think about

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:44.159
the judgment seat of Christ for believers,

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:45.959
the first event after we're raptured out of here,

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:47.359
and the marriage supper, the lamb, the last,

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:48.639
before we return with Christ.

00:23:48.639 --> 00:23:50.799
There ain't rule with him for 1,000 glorious years

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.519
on this earth during the millennium.

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:54.199
I have to think about the fact the Bible says

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.199
that the day will come that I will stand

00:23:56.199 --> 00:23:58.679
before the judgment bar, before the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:01.199
the judgment seat of Christ for believers, the abema seat,

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:02.439
and I'm gonna have to give an answer

00:24:02.439 --> 00:24:03.839
for everything done in the body,

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:06.479
everything done in this world, when I lived in this life,

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:08.239
everything done in the body would be good or bad.

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.939
I'm gonna have to answer for that.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:13.359
Now, I don't wanna have to give a bad answer.

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:16.519
We're gonna have to answer.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.720
Better be prepared and be ready when he comes.

00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:26.880
I'm telling you, he's coming.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.359
It's a sure event.

00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:32.399
It's an absolute event, it's going to happen.

00:24:32.399 --> 00:24:34.279
Look at it, 1 John 2, let's go there.

00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:37.600
1 John 2 and verse 26.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.039
I'm gonna move quickly, so stick with me.

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:40.139
I'll probably just read some of this

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:42.100
without you having to turn there, but listen.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.759
1 John 2 and verse 26, he said this.

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:47.559
He said, these things are written unto you,

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:49.919
concerning them that seduce you.

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:51.519
But the anointing which you have received in him

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:53.759
abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you,

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:56.039
but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,

00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:57.799
and is truth, and is no lie,

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:01.500
and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.839
Now look, verse 28.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:04.880
And now, little children, look.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.679
And now, little children, abide in him.

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:09.279
What does it say in John chapter 15, abide in me?

00:25:10.199 --> 00:25:11.600
Abide in me.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.639
You wanna have the joy of the Lord,

00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:16.000
there's two things you need to do, abide and obey.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.119
We see that in John chapter 15.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:19.239
He said, now, little children,

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:22.600
abide in him that when he shall appear,

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.399
oh yeah, there it is.

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:27.720
When he shall appear, we may have confidence

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.199
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:34.600
Okay, now, if you read that the way I read that,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.759
you've got the right kind of Bible.

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:36.919
Basically, what it says is this.

00:25:36.919 --> 00:25:40.279
It's possible to be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:42.919
I do not wanna be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:48.239
Verse 29, if you know that he is righteous,

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:50.720
you know that everyone that doeth righteousness

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.959
is born of him.

00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:53.600
Oh, now, wait a minute.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.000
Did you see the word doeth?

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.119
If you've ever looked it up at your Bible,

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.600
if you ever look at the Strong's Concordance

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.119
and figure out how many times the word do appears

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:03.440
in the Bible, it appears a lot.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.160
God has given us things to do.

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:07.320
He said, now, he said, you know,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.539
everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him.

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:10.940
That's the evidence of salvation,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.019
the desire to live righteous in Christ Jesus.

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:16.299
That doesn't mean that we live that way all the time.

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:17.899
There's times we get out of fellowship with God,

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:18.859
when we backslide.

00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:20.419
Someone said, oh, but Brother Meshonder,

00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:22.059
there's no backslide in New Testament Christianity.

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:23.160
Oh, yes, there is.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.059
And you know that we can backslide,

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:28.139
get out of fellowship with the Lord.

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:29.019
Now, that happens to us.

00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:30.179
However, somewhere along the line,

00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:31.660
God will get us back on track again

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.899
because he loves us and cares for us,

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:36.779
and he'll chasten us back into fellowship if he needs to.

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:38.940
I'm glad for that, aren't you?

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:40.979
That's the evidence of salvation, amen.

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:43.299
Chapter three and verse one, it says,

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:47.179
behold, in other words, in common vernaculars,

00:26:47.179 --> 00:26:50.919
look at here, behold, what manner.

00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:51.759
I like that.

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:52.820
I like what it says right there.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.100
It says, what manner, what quality of what character

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.859
of what manner of love the Father bestowed upon us

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:02.019
that we, that we should be called the sons of God,

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:05.940
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.380
Therefore, the world knoweth us not.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.539
Well, it doesn't know him, so it doesn't know us either.

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:11.059
The world does not understand us

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:13.559
because the world doesn't understand him.

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:17.539
So it says here, behold, what manner of love

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:18.739
the Father bestowed upon us

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:20.899
that we should be called the sons of God.

00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:23.579
Therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him not.

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:27.259
Behold this, beloved, now, now are we the sons of God.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:30.419
That's present tense, amen.

00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:31.299
I'm a child of the king.

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.220
I'm a king's kid, praise the Lord.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.979
Beloved, now are we the sons of God,

00:27:34.979 --> 00:27:37.899
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be.

00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:41.019
But we know, we know that when he shall appear,

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:46.019
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.

00:27:47.619 --> 00:27:48.940
Now watch verse three.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.059
And every man that hath this hope in him

00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:54.919
purifies himself even as he is pure.

00:27:56.699 --> 00:27:57.539
Are you ready?

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:02.579
I mean, it's a valid question, are you ready?

00:28:02.579 --> 00:28:04.579
I mean, God says that we can be ashamed

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.259
of what is appearing and we're not living right

00:28:06.259 --> 00:28:07.720
as a Christian.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.859
And then it says over here that, listen,

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:11.459
every man that hath this hope in him,

00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:13.100
I've got the blessed hope.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.279
I'm a child of God, I belong to him.

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:17.940
I'm not my own, the Bible says we're not our own,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.779
we're bought with a price.

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:21.739
I belong to him, I'm his child.

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:25.239
And so God expects of me to live a holy life.

00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:28.000
So he says, and every man that hath this hope in him,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.359
now listen, I've got the blessed hope.

00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:31.339
I know he's coming, I know he's coming soon, amen,

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:33.659
because it says it in the blessed book.

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:35.659
And every man that hath this hope in him

00:28:35.659 --> 00:28:37.419
purifies himself even as pure.

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:40.059
So God wants us to live a pure life.

00:28:41.539 --> 00:28:44.260
I ought to preach on holiness this week.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.700
I know what it is, a lot of people are afraid of holiness.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.419
They say, well, if you start preaching on holiness,

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:50.140
they'll think you're Pentecostal.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.700
Has nothing to do with Pentecostalism.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.140
It has everything that the Bible teaches,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.339
be holy from holy, God says, amen?

00:28:57.339 --> 00:28:58.899
So I think it's important for us to realize

00:28:58.899 --> 00:29:00.339
how important it is for us to have a holy,

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:04.099
separated, sanctified, godly life in Christ Jesus.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:05.659
Now, you don't have to go there unless you want to,

00:29:05.659 --> 00:29:08.059
but I'm gonna go to Titus chapter two now,

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:10.419
and I'm gonna look at something here in Titus chapter two

00:29:10.419 --> 00:29:12.020
that I think is a real blessing.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.500
Titus chapter two, and I'm gonna start there in verse 11.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.739
It says this, for the grace of God

00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:23.919
that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men.

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:24.760
Well, why?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.299
Because all sin comes short of the glory of God.

00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:27.500
There's none righteous, no, not one.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.979
There's none that doeth good.

00:29:29.899 --> 00:29:33.179
Teaching us, look at this, teaching us, the saved,

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:35.260
that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.940
we should live soberly, righteously,

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.380
and godly in this present world.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.219
Looking, oh yes, amen, looking for that blessed hope

00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:48.460
and the glorious appearing of the great God

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.299
and our Savior, Jesus Christ,

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:52.500
who gave himself for us that he might redeem us

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.140
from all iniquity and purify himself

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.500
that peculiar people zealous of good works.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.779
That word peculiar is an interesting word.

00:29:57.779 --> 00:29:59.419
It comes from the Greek word, periuseos,

00:29:59.419 --> 00:30:01.140
and it means this, it means being.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.060
on the usual, special, or set aside.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.100
I like that.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.220
Do you know the Bible says you and I

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.260
were saved by the grace of God are special?

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.520
Did you know that?

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.660
That's what it means, per iusios.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.020
We're special in the sight of God.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.840
Why?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.160
Because we're His children.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.000
We belong to Him.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.460
No, aren't your kids special?

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.660
Amen?

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.540
Somebody said to me, not my kids, I don't know.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.300
No, we're special in His sight because we're His.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.340
We've been bought with a price,

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.200
ransomed in the blood of Jesus, amen?

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.360
So we're special.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.180
So it says, who gave Himself for us

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.820
that He might redeem us from all iniquity

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.580
and purify Himself of peculiar people?

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.480
Look what it says, zealous of good works.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.020
Zealous of good works.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.980
We should be zealous of good works,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.900
and we should be living like that.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.380
We should be living in a manner

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.300
which demonstrates the fact that we're His child,

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.860
we belong to Him, we're saved, we're born again,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.700
washed in the blood of the Lamb.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.220
Why would we be zealous about doing good works?

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.060
Amen?

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.300
1 Thessalonians chapter four.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.460
We all know this passage of Scripture,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.140
but if you want to go there, go with me.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.840
I love it, it's a wonderful passage of Scripture.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.220
1 Thessalonians chapter four, verse 13.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.840
It says this,

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.360
but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.520
concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.960
these that have died in Christ and gone on before,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.380
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.680
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.580
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.640
will God bring with Him.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.100
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.440
that we which are alive and remain

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.300
unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.980
them which are asleep.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.060
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.740
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.860
with the trumpet of God,

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.340
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.100
Someone said to me, I'll show you this in a minute,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.020
that they said the word rapture is not in the Bible,

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.260
or the word trinity is in the Bible either.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.660
Well, we believe in a triune Godhead,

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.940
the hypostatic union.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.540
So it says, for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.580
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.540
with the trumpet of God,

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.340
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.920
Verse 17, then we which are alive

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.520
and remain should be caught up.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.160
The word caught up is from the Greek word harpazo.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.720
And you know what that word means?

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.300
Means to carry off.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.600
It means to snatch up.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.680
It means to grasp hastily.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.600
It means to rapture.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.800
There it is right there.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.080
Those two words give reference to the rapture, amen.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.000
Then we which are alive remain should be caught up

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.520
together with them in the clouds.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.040
Now we'll be caught up together with them.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.640
They have six more feet to go than we do

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.040
because they'll resurrect out of the grave.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.700
We'll be all be caught up together.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.660
And a glorified body, we're gonna get a glorified body.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.100
We'll talk about that in a minute.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.300
To meet in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air,

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.980
and so shall we ever be with the Lord, amen.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.660
And then it says, wherefore comfort one another

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.540
with these words.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.060
Man, we used to say all the time, Maranatha, Maranatha.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.780
You know what that means, the Lord cometh.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.940
Maranatha, we ought to comfort each other with these words.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.140
Hey, you know what, friends, Jesus is coming soon.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.320
That comforts me.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.180
It comforts me.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.140
It is referenced the same thing over in the next chapter.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.220
We ought to comfort one another with these words.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.500
We're too busy talking about all this negative stuff.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.140
Hey, we've gotten so negative.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.900
Look how quiet when I said that.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.180
We've gotten negative, friends.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.940
We have become a negative society, a negative culture.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.700
Everybody's complaining about everything all the time.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.900
Nobody likes anything anymore.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.300
Everything's falling apart.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.800
I mean, everybody's moaning and complaining

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.640
and everything else.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.960
I'm gonna tell you what, when I stop thinking

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.640
about what it says right here in this passage of Scripture,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.680
and I realize the day's coming when Jesus is gonna come

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.200
and snatch me off the face of this earth

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.320
and give me a glorified body,

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.680
and I'm gonna look like Jesus,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.080
I'm gonna tell you what, the negativity goes away.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.520
I don't wanna live in a negative aura.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.120
I don't wanna live in a negative world.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.160
I get sick of it.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.560
This morning, I just happened,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.680
I said this to the men yesterday,

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.120
I just happened to speak to a couple of the men

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.160
and I said, you know what,

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.740
I said this to the men yesterday,

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.580
I just happened to spend a few minutes looking at the news,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.940
and I thought, this isn't news.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.160
This is conditioning.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.580
All they're trying to do is condition me.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.020
They're just trying to manipulate me.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.300
They're just trying to get me on board

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.660
with all this negative nonsense.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.820
And it's just like, we're at war with ourselves, friends.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.260
We go in, an internal war going on here.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.460
And I'm thinking, well, I don't wanna live

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.660
in a world like this.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.300
No, I don't live in an unrealistic world.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.860
I don't wanna live in a world of fantasy

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.400
or make believe.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.080
This isn't Disneyland that we're living in.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.320
This is a wicked fallen by world

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.080
and it's not gonna get any better.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.320
So I need to comfort myself with these words.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.740
Maranatha, amen, he's coming.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.720
And we ought to have that upper look of expectation

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.980
and be eternity minded because I'm gonna tell you what,

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.040
this world is not my home.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.160
I'm just passing through, man,

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.760
my citizenship's in glory, amen.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.440
I see that over in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.160
I tell you what, I thank God for that promise.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.940
And so we need to recognize how important it is

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.100
to comfort ourselves with these words.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.700
First Corinthians chapter 15.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.100
Ah, familiar passage of scripture again,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.580
just preached to you the other day at a funeral.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.280
First Corinthians chapter 15, another familiar passage.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.780
In verse 50, now it says this,

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.860
"'Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.180
"'cannot inherit the kingdom of God,

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.920
"'neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.020
"'Behold, I show you a mystery.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.200
"'We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.720
"'In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye,

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.580
"'at the last trump, for the trumpets will sound,

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.920
"'and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.560
"'and we shall all be changed, amen.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.640
"'For this corruptible must put on incorruption,

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.680
"'and this mortal must put on immortality.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.060
"'So when this corruptible shall put on incorruption,

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.620
"'and this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.720
"'then shall be brought to pass the saying

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.220
"'that is written, death is spoiled up in victory.'"

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.100
Look at this, here it is.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.240
"'Oh, death, where is thy sting?

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.960
"'Oh, grave, where is thy victory?

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.480
"'Well, the sting of death is sin,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.680
"'and the strength of sin is the law,

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.260
"'but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.820
"'through our Lord Jesus Christ.'"

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.620
Wow, I'll tell you what, what a joy it is to read

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.060
that precious portion of scripture,

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.120
and know that death has no hold over me.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.860
I mean, if you die in Christ before the rapture takes place,

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.480
yeah, they're gonna put your body in the ground

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.600
and be asked to be present with the Lord.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.480
One day, body, soul, and spirit

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.840
will be reunited at the rapture,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.680
but the thing of the matter is,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.880
to be asked to be present with the Lord,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.480
we're gonna be with the Lord Jesus anyway.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.600
I'm looking forward to that day.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.800
If I go out by death, that's fine with me.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.840
Death has no hold over me.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.800
There's no sting in death.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.740
Grave has no victory over me.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.760
I thank God for that.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.160
That's a precious promise.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.080
Amen.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080
John chapter 14.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.600
Now, if you're still going to follow along with me,

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.120
we're going over to John chapter 14.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.560
I'm almost done reading scripture,

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.080
but John chapter 14, verse one,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.720
here's another precious promise.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.200
Jesus speaking here, I think specifically to Peter,

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.720
if you read the last part of John 13,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.600
but also the rest of the disciples, and now to you and me.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.160
In John chapter 14, I read this.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.020
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.420
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.300
Now, I'll tell you, during COVID, boy, it was amazing to me.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.340
I have never seen so many Christian people

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.420
wringing their hands and troubled by a virus.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.220
Oh yeah, a lot of people got sick and people died,

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.520
and we know that.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.360
I got COVID.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.780
My wife and I got it.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.020
My daughter's had it three times.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.220
We've got friends that have long COVID.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.940
So it's a bad virus.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.060
We know that.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.280
But really, when it comes down to it,

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.400
why should we who know Christ allow it to control us

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.560
and back us into a corner of fear

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.680
and trouble us to the point

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.480
to where we end up just falling apart emotionally

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.780
and spiritually?

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.320
I mean, we need to be wise,

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.660
as serpents and harmlessness does.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.500
We know that.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.120
We need to be wise about things,

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.080
but we don't need to be foolish either.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.240
Jesus said this.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.040
He said, let not your heart be troubled.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.920
We live in a troubled world.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.580
We live in troubled times.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.700
But listen, friends,

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.300
I was born right at the end of World War II,

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.300
and some of you before that,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.460
and I cannot remember a time in my lifetime

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.380
when we were more troubled than we are today

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.220
in my lifetime.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.120
We are troubled people, but we've always had trouble.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.700
You go back and read the Old Testament, man.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.380
There's a lot of trouble in the Old Testament.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.480
The apostle Paul experienced a lot of trouble.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.660
Peter experienced trouble.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.180
All the disciples experienced trouble.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.320
The apostles had trouble in their lives.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.619
We have trouble in our lives.

00:38:33.619 --> 00:38:34.920
But he said this.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.520
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:38:38.359 --> 00:38:40.859
You believe in God, believe also in me.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.760
In my Father's house are,

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.320
that's present tense, many mansions.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.179
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:50.200
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.100
Now here it is.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.600
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.600
I will come again and receive you unto myself

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:01.179
that where I am, there you may be also.

00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:03.100
Well, let me tell you, hallelujah.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.820
Hallelujah for that precious promise of the word of God.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.580
How I thank God for that promise.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.140
Don't you?

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.700
Now let's go to 1 Timothy, or 2 Timothy rather,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.660
in chapter four.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.460
2 Timothy chapter four.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.980
Now here's where I wrap up my message.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.119
2 Timothy chapter four.

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:23.440
Having said all that and built a little bit of foundation,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.600
let me show you this.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.780
Now this is a pastoral epistle,

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:29.359
but also too, it's a prison epistle.

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.920
And we know that Paul was at the end of his life here.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.119
He's about ready to be martyred for the cause of Christ.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:37.080
And we look in 2 Timothy chapter four

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.760
as he gives instruction to his young son

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.960
in the faith who by this time was in his fifties.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.460
And he says this, he said,

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.520
now look, Timothy, I charge you therefore

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.040
before God and the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.480
who shall judge the quick and the dead

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.880
and is appearing in his kingdom.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.440
He said, now look, preach the word

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.160
and be instant in season out of season.

00:39:56.179 --> 00:39:58.500
Whether you want to hear it or not, just preach it anyway.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.900
Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:06.620
doctrine. And what is doctrine? It's teaching. For the time will come when they will not

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:11.140
endure sound doctrine. Man, we are certainly living in a day that's marked by that. But

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.500
after their own lustily heaped themselves, teachers having itching ears, you know, tell

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.100
me some smooth thing, something goes down easy. Don't preach my sin. I'll tell you what,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.300
we talk about the 70s. Boy, them brethren back there in the 70s, man, they preached

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:30.260
sin. I mean, they named sin. I can remember Lester Olaf, man, he named sin. Some of those

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.580
guys like J. Harold Smith, man, and B.R. Lakin, those old preachers, man, they named sin.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.980
They called what it was and what it is. And we don't do so much of that anymore, but sometimes

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.220
it awakens people to it. You know, I think it's a funny thing that people don't want

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:49.300
you to name their sin. You know, and you can pretty much tell who's doing it by the countenance

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.420
that ends up when you mention their sin. I mean, it's an amazing thing. I was at church

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.900
one time and a person came up to me and said, now preacher, on the first day of the meeting,

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:08.900
she said, now preacher, did my pastor tell you about me? I said, no, ma'am, I don't even

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.940
know who you are. She said, my pastor must have told you about me because you said something

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:21.180
about me from the pulpit this morning. I said, ma'am, I don't even know who you are. Huh?

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.380
Come on. And she said, well, she said, well, you just hit my, and I said, yeah, I know

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.740
what you're going to say, but you're not going to say, well, I'm going to say I hit your

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.860
sin this morning. I preached something that didn't sit well with you because you're guilty.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:41.380
I didn't know who she was, but God knows. And God pointed it out. Well, it gave her

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:48.340
an opportunity to get right with the Lord. So, so he says this, look, he said now in

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:54.300
verse 4, And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.340
But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of the evangelists, make full

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.460
proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.420
is at hand. Now he says this, I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I've

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.980
kept my faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness. One of the

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.380
five crowns mentioned in the Bible, a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.300
judge shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:34.060
is appearing. Oh, now that's precious. There's a crown of righteousness, which the apostle

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:40.300
Paul said that I have that crown. But I want you to know, he says, that that crown of righteousness

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:47.860
is also reserved for all them that love is appearing. So that's a doctrinal truth, friends.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.660
That's what it is. And so my question is for me and for you, for all of us here this morning,

00:42:52.660 --> 00:43:01.580
do we love His appearing? Do we love that promise? Do we love that doctrinal truth that

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.820
yes, He is coming soon? Yes, He is going to rapture us out of here. Yes, He is going to

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.180
give us a glorified body. Oh, I look forward to that. No more sickness, no more sin. Amen.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.860
No more aches, no more pains, no more cancer, no more heart attacks, no more disease. We're

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:23.300
going to get that glorified body one day and look like Jesus. That's the promise of Scripture.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:32.640
But the question is, do you love His appearing? Do you love His appearing? Is it something

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:43.360
that to you is precious? Something to you that's important? Something to you that's

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:51.200
not only inevitable, but also something to you that drives you and I to live the kind

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.800
of life which is pleasing to Him so that we do stand in front of Him, we're not ashamed

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:02.080
of Him, ashamed at His appearing. We want to not be ashamed. Do you love His appearing?

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.200
Let me read something to you and then we're going to be done. I don't even know who wrote

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.280
this. I have no idea who wrote it. It doesn't really matter. It's just true. And I just

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:18.720
happened to pick this up somewhere. It says, But unto all them also that love is appearing.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.080
For many years, this guy writes, for many years I thought this expression referred to

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.240
those believers who had kindly sentimental feelings about the coming of the Lord. They

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.340
would be rewarded with the crown of righteousness because their hearts glowed warm when they

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.740
thought about the rapture. Now, friends, you know what he's saying here. I understand

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:40.320
what he's saying. That's just really not all that there is to this. But I mean it does

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.660
make you kind of excited if you think about it. But surely it means more than this. To

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.460
love His appearing means to live in the light of His coming to behave as if He were coming

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:56.340
today. Thus to love His appearing means to live in moral purity. To love His appearing

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:02.220
means to live in moral purity. For as John reminds us, And every man that hath this hope

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.420
in him purified himself even as he is pure. I read that this morning. It means to stay

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.500
disentangled from the things of this life. We should set our affections on things above,

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.460
not on things on the earth, Colossians 3.2. In short, it means that we won't do anything

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:20.540
that we would not want to be found doing when He appears. We would not go anywhere that

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.420
would cause shame at His coming. We would not say anything that would be offensive in

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:29.420
His presence. If you knew that Christ were coming in a week, well, how would you spend

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:34.060
the intervening days? Does it mean that you would give up your job, go to a mountaintop

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.060
and spend all day reading the Bible and praying? Does it mean that you would go into full-time

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:42.060
Christian work, preaching and teaching day and night? If we are really walking with the

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:47.060
Lord today and living in the center of His will, it would mean carrying on as usual.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.700
However, we are living for self, then it would require, if we're living for self, then it

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.140
would require some revolutionary changes. It's not enough to have kind thoughts about

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.220
the Savior's return. The crown of righteousness is reserved for those who love it enough to

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:09.220
let the truth mold their lives. It's not to hold the truth about His coming, the truth

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:14.100
must hold us. World events are soon to culminate in the outtaking of the saints at the trump

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.060
and shout. The prophetic clock is right on schedule. The Lord Jesus is coming soon and

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:23.140
not tarry. Are you ready? Do you have that upper look of expectation? Are you prayed

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:32.580
up, packed up and ready to go up? Now, here's a quick illustration and I'm going to pray.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:43.660
Let's just suppose that you were a young college man living in a little apartment. And let

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:52.020
me say this, I know this from personal experience, most young men are not necessarily real tidy.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:57.220
They're bachelors. There's no wife around to keep things straightened out for them,

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.940
amen? They're living in a room by themselves, got a nice little apartment and the place

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:06.940
is trashed. They've got piles of laundry that haven't been washed in two months. There's

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:12.460
so much dirt in the carpets you could grow potatoes there. Dishes piled up in the sink

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:18.820
that need to be washed and bacteria just growing like crazy all over the dishes. Socks

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.820
on the floor and beds not made and all the rest of that. So you get a phone call from

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.580
somebody and they say, listen, I'm in town. I'm about an hour out and I want to stop by

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:43.300
and see you. I won't stay long, just want to stop by and see you. And you say, uh, okay.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:52.380
And you hang up. Now, now you've got to go to work tidying up that place and getting

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.500
it somewhat respectable so that when your friend comes by to see you, that things look

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:03.540
pretty good. It's a last minute thing. So you know what you're going to do? You're going

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:10.460
to hide everything. You're going to cover up, make it look as good as you can by hiding

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:18.220
stuff. You shove all the dirty laundry under the bed. You take the dirty dishes and everything

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:24.860
that's in your sink and you put it underneath in the cupboard. By the way, it's not going

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:35.180
to go away by itself. You make your bed best you can and you try to put your place in order

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:45.260
for this last minute visit. Well, I'm afraid that's the way a lot of God's people are.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:51.900
They're living disorderly lives and then they say to themselves, well, at the last minute

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.660
if I knew Jesus were coming this week, I'd get everything cleaned up. That is not the

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:04.100
way to live. That's a terrible way to live. It's a miserable way to live. And by the way,

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.580
in the book of James in chapter one, it talks about that being a form of self-deception.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.020
You're just deceiving yourself. You can't live like that and not think God doesn't see

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:18.300
it. You can't hide that stuff from God. And when he comes, he's not going to say, well,

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.340
praise the Lord. I see you got cleaned up in the last week of here on the face of the

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.660
earth and now you're here with me and everything. You got everything straightened out. No, no.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.580
God wants us to live right all the time so that when he does come, we're prepared and

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.300
ready. And then it just shows we love his appearing because we know when he's coming,

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:41.260
he's going to come. He is going to come. It's better to be ready. Better to be ready. That's

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:47.940
a motivator. I don't want him to find me living dirty. What's the last thing you listen to?

00:49:48.619 --> 00:49:50.980
What's the last thing you watch? What's the last thing you said? What's the last thing you did

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:58.860
before the Trump? I said one meeting, wouldn't it be a terrible thing to say,

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.980
by the grace of God, I'm talking to the fellows a lot about.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.480
about this, wouldn't it be horrible if you say,

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.860
by the grace of God, the last thing you were doing

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.060
was looking at pornography on your computer?

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.860
I mean, that's not really demonstrating

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.420
a love of His appearing, is it?

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.660
Your home was not swept and garnished and kept clean,

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.340
so because of that, you're gonna have to answer for it.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.740
I mean, I don't wanna have to answer for that.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.860
I don't wanna answer for my thought life.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.140
But we all have a problem with that.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.100
Don't say you don't, because you do.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.920
We all have a problem sometimes with that thought life.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.340
What were we thinking when He came?

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.940
What are you thinking right now?

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.700
Do you love His appearing, are you ready?

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.540
Are you saved, and do you know that?

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.980
And if you are, are you living for Him

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.340
and ready for a soon return?

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.740
Only you can answer that question.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.780
Let's all stand, would you stand with me, please?

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.980
Our sister's coming to play the instrument.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.140
With everybody standing, with heads bowed,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.900
knives closed, if you will, please.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.140
I wanna have a season of imitation.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.520
The pastor's here, and if you need to speak with him

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.040
this morning, he's here, or with me,

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.120
or with any leaders in the church,

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.980
but we're here if we can help you

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.080
with anything this morning.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.320
But first off, let me ask this.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.760
You're saved, do you know you're saved?

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.040
Is there a time and place in your life

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.220
marked by a distinct change,

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.380
where you became a new creature in Christ,

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.840
having believed the gospel in your heart,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.720
the death, burn, and resurrection of Jesus Christ,

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.680
the bodily resurrection of the Savior,

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.280
having believed that in your heart,

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.120
you've been in the Calvary,

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.200
you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb,

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.720
your sins have been forgiven, blotted out,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.880
and washed away in your name

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.560
written in the Lamb's Book of Life,

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.200
marked by a distinct change,

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.640
where you realized and believed and knew

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.760
and understood you were saved.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.800
If you don't have that testimony,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.640
you ought to come this morning

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.760
and let us show you from the Bible

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.360
how you can come to Christ.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.260
But Christian, how about you?

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.640
Are you ready?

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.800
Do your love is appearing?

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.840
Are you right with God?

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.960
Is there sin in your life

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.760
that needs to be resolved today?

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.660
If my people which are called by my name

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.920
will humble themselves and pray and seek my face

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.160
and turn from their wicked ways,

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.680
then will I hear from heaven,

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.960
then will I forgive their sin,

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.560
and then will I heal their land.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.240
That promise given to the nation of Israel

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.400
also has a practical application to you and me this morning.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.440
As the instrument begins to play,

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.320
God speak in your heart, just step out and come.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.080
This old-fashioned gospel order's open this morning.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.840
God speak in your heart, just come.
