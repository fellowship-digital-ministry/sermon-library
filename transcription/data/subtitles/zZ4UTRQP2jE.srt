1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
this evening, Matthew 15. I'm going to take a couple of verses of Scripture here from

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,199
this 15th chapter of the book of Matthew and look at these verses and then we're going

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:18,000
to spend much time in various portions of the Word of God this evening. And the Bible

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,639
speaks often about the heart of man. And we find that throughout the Scriptures there

5
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:31,040
are many references to the heart of man. In fact, we find many descriptive terms that

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,080
are used in order to address the heart of man. In our text of Scripture here in Matthew

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,040
15 in verse number 18, the Bible says, but those things which proceed out of the mouth

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:50,720
come forth from the heart and they defile the man. Now, you understand that as we look

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,240
through the passage of Scripture here that Jesus is speaking to these religious leaders

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,500
and they make a statement in verse number two. It says, why do thy disciples transgress

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,639
the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread? How many

12
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:12,440
of you heard your parents say, wash your hands before you eat, right? And these religious

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,400
leaders, they're saying, hey, you're disciples, they're not washing their hands and so on

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,720
and so forth. And we see that the Lord begins to deal with them on the heart of the matter.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,040
He starts discussing their heart and he goes through and he tells them various things.

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,680
He tells them in verse number, let's just pick it in verse number five, but you say,

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,300
whosoever shall say to his father, his mother, it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,879
profited by me and honor not his father, his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made

19
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,440
the commandment of God of none effect. How? By your tradition, ye hypocrites. Well, did

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,239
Isaiah the prophet say, or Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me

21
00:01:53,239 --> 00:02:00,680
with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips. Notice this, but their heart is far

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,240
from me, but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men. He

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,520
called the multitude and said unto them, hear and understand. We find that as Jesus

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,080
is teaching them, he says in verse number 13, but he answered and said, every plant

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,919
which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone, they be

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,520
blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,759
Then answered Peter and said unto him, declare unto us this parable. And Jesus said, are

28
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,039
you also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth

29
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:41,520
in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the drought. But those things

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:50,199
which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man. Notice

31
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:58,119
verse 19 for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,

32
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:05,279
thefts, false witnesses, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man. But to

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:13,839
eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man. Every young boy's favorite verse of scripture.

34
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:18,839
But look, as we look at the passage of scripture and we understand what Jesus is saying here

35
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:23,119
and as he's dealing with the heart of the matter, we find that it's interesting how

36
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:28,559
that we noticed the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ and we couple it with what the

37
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:33,880
proverb declares in Proverbs four and verse number 23, the Bible says, keep thy heart

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,399
with all diligence. For out of it, out of the heart, what does the Bible say? Are the

39
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:47,759
issues of life, right? And so for out of it are the issues of life. And so we think about

40
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:55,119
keeping my heart with all diligence and the important aspect as we find here, I've often

41
00:03:55,119 --> 00:04:00,800
said as I've interacted with people over the years that this is a heart issue. This is

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,160
a heart issue. I've had times in which I've spoken to individuals and they've shared things

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,639
with me that I would never repeat things of just gross immorality of just things that

44
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,679
they've been involved with and so on and so forth. And I've tried to explain to them that

45
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:23,179
there's a heart issue and they need in this particular or in these situations, what they

46
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:28,839
really need is salvation. Begin to deal with that. But see, they can go somewhere and they

47
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:35,959
can find someone that will diagnose them with some type of a situation and they just go

48
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,679
ahead and they just say, well, then this is just, I'm addicted to this, that or the other

49
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:47,559
because someone will say that. And I say, no, no, it's a heart issue. It's a heart issue.

50
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:54,559
And we find here that in the text of scripture that Jesus says out of the heart proceed.

51
00:04:55,559 --> 00:05:00,799
Now, we are going to look at these things here in just a moment, but I want you to understand

52
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,600
that as we notice these verses of scripture here in Matthew 15, Proverbs 4 and verse 23,

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,959
it's very easy for us to look at a number of other verses of scripture that deal with

54
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,000
the heart and we can easily conclude that God is not speaking about the organ that beats

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in my chest. Amen? That's what he's talking about. We find that as it would be a heart

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,600
can be defined by Webster in the 1828 Webster's dictionary, that what he's speaking of is

57
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:39,559
the seat of the affections and passions as of love, joy, grief, enmity, courage, pleasures,

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,920
et cetera. So we find that the scriptures, that's what's being referred to when he speaks

59
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,160
of the heart. This evening as we look at some Bible truth, I want to preach a message that

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,399
I've titled the heart of the matter. I said to you this morning, it is not something that

61
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:03,320
I coined as a phrase, but someone wisely said, the heart of the matter is a matter of the

62
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,920
heart. I tried to look that up to find out exactly who it was that said it and I found

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,799
some conflicting things. I had a Bible college professor that said, if you can't find out

64
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:17,440
who said it, just claim it that you said it. I don't think that's really good advice and

65
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,720
so I won't make that claim this evening because someone said it well before I was ever born.

66
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,359
But the reality is that what was said in that statement is so vitally true. You know the

67
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:35,239
reality is that as we think about that truth in Proverbs 4 and verse number 23, when the

68
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:42,160
wise man noted, keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life, we each

69
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,399
would conclude that there are many issues of life. Many things, problems. We spoke this

70
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,920
morning about the fact that our God is greater than any problem that we ever will face. And

71
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,760
does it matter if that problem is a personal problem or a global problem, our God is greater.

72
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm thankful that while all those men were looking at the stature and the size and the

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,880
strength of Goliath, that David was almost just not even affected by it. Why? Because

74
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,480
he was so focused on his God. I know how that we would have that same perspective.

75
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,799
We find that there are many problems in our society. It's not hard for us to identify

76
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:27,640
problems that we see within our society. The problem is coming to the root of the problem.

77
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,959
The issue that we deal with in our society is how so many problems are going on and so

78
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,720
many issues that are raging in our society and the way in which people want to categorize

79
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,799
those problems or describe those problems and the solutions that would sought to be

80
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:51,279
given for those problems, they're avoiding the root of the problem. It's a hard issue.

81
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,920
It's a hard issue. And we find that there's a heart problem in our society. You say, Pastor,

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,640
how can you so boldly say there's a heart problem in our society? Because Jesus said

83
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:09,160
it. Notice again in our text of Scripture here in Matthew 15, I want you to look and

84
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,519
it's interesting, there are seven items that are mentioned here specifically that Jesus

85
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,040
deals with that these are those things which proceed out of the heart. Notice he says for

86
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,959
out of the heart proceed, number one, evil thoughts. Evil thoughts. We spent some time

87
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,000
not long ago in a message dealing with the truth of Philippians 4.8. What it is that

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,479
we're to think on. And we look at that passage of Scripture and we see the way in which those

89
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,880
thoughts are described and Paul concludes the verse by saying think on these things.

90
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,599
Well here we find that Jesus says that what proceed out of the mouth, the number one thing

91
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:56,159
he says for out of the heart proceed, I said mouth, excuse me, for out of the heart proceed

92
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:10,400
evil thoughts. Notice number two, murders. Murders. There's a lot of murder in our world.

93
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,880
Yeah? I read recently that in Chicago you're more likely to get shot than you are in Afghanistan.

94
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:28,760
That's sad. That's ridiculous. Amen? Twenty month old was shot yesterday and killed in

95
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:37,479
Chicago, drive-by shooting. And here's what they said, when is it going to stop? Almost

96
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:41,159
every weekend of this year there's been over 100 shootings in Chicago. I know we don't

97
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:50,520
live in Chicago. But murders? Yeah, we see it. Notice, adulteries. Yeah, it's a heart

98
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,440
issue. It's a heart issue. Fornications. Thefts.

99
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,740
False witness.

100
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,040
Blasphemies.

101
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
Blasphemies, often we think about

102
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,180
the word blasphemy and its relation to God

103
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,140
and dealing with the fact that we would

104
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,900
speak of the Lord in terms of impious irreverence.

105
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,080
We find here that this list that is provided

106
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440
seven things that the Lord says

107
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,980
out of the heart proceed.

108
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,

109
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,380
fornications, thefts, false witness,

110
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,140
and blasphemies.

111
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,340
In just a little while, we'll go to Galatians

112
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,740
and notice how the Bible describes

113
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,480
the works of the flesh.

114
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,680
In that passage of Scripture,

115
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,220
there are 19 things that are mentioned.

116
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,680
The works of the flesh.

117
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,320
See, I want you to consider with me this evening,

118
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
take your Bible, go all the way back

119
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,180
to the book of Genesis.

120
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,120
I told you we'd go through some things.

121
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,280
And listen, I understand we could spend

122
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,680
a lot of time looking at a whole lot of things.

123
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
But I'm going to try to just go through

124
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,880
a few references this evening

125
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,620
to help you to understand that the heart

126
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,620
of the matter is a matter of the heart.

127
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,980
It's a heart issue.

128
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,720
We're dealing with a society.

129
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,420
Listen, we understand theologically

130
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,220
that man is not basically good.

131
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,880
Right?

132
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,620
The world wants to say,

133
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,520
oh man, they're basically good.

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,080
No.

135
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,779
There's none good.

136
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,720
No, not one.

137
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
You say, that's so harsh.

138
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,620
No, it's just Bible.

139
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,120
Amen?

140
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
It's just Bible.

141
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
There's none good.

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,660
No, not one.

143
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,860
Right?

144
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,720
All of your good works, Isaiah said,

145
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,260
it's like filthy rags.

146
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Right?

147
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,459
And we find that, listen,

148
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,660
within the heart of man,

149
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,720
I mean, when we're born,

150
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
because of the sin that's recorded

151
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,459
in Genesis chapter number three,

152
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,560
sin entered into the world.

153
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,760
We understand that through that sin,

154
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,420
that sin and death has passed to all men,

155
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,720
apart from the Lord Jesus Christ,

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,959
because he's virgin born.

157
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,779
Amen?

158
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,760
Someone said, by the way,

159
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,160
something came across my desk this week.

160
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Does the virgin birth of Christ really matter?

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,620
Absolutely it matters.

162
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
You've got to be kidding me.

163
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,920
From a church that says

164
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,760
that they're a Baptist church.

165
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,300
Anyway, I'm not preaching on that tonight.

166
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,419
Don't know why it came up.

167
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,119
All right?

168
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,100
But listen, the reality this evening

169
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,400
is that when we look at these subject matters

170
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,320
and we understand, listen,

171
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,800
man is not basically good.

172
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,199
What was going on in the book of Judges?

173
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,460
Every man did that was right in his own sight.

174
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,300
Right?

175
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,260
In his own eyes.

176
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,800
He became his own authority.

177
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
And here's the huge problem

178
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,339
that we deal with in our society today

179
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,760
that no one wants to address, by the way,

180
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,160
because we really don't want to deal with the truth.

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
But what we have done

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
is we have systematically removed God

183
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,300
from our culture.

184
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,500
And as we systematically remove God from our culture,

185
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,160
it really is following the pattern

186
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,839
of Romans chapter number one.

187
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,339
Right?

188
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,040
We don't want to have God.

189
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,000
We don't want God.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,500
Why?

191
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,000
Because I don't want to be accountable to God.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And if I remove God,

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,479
somehow in my warped idea

194
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,600
that the God of this world, Satan,

195
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,100
has blinded the minds of them that believe not.

196
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
They come to this place.

197
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,779
They try to remove God.

198
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,380
Look at all of the attack on the record of Genesis.

199
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,740
Creation and the fall of man

200
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,479
and the flood and all of those things.

201
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,339
It's attacked, attacked, attacked.

202
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:20,839
Why?

203
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,240
We're trying to remove God.

204
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,540
And to remove God from society,

205
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,740
somebody or something has to be the authority.

206
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,240
And what happens is I become my own authority.

207
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,940
And we see that in the book of Judges.

208
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,639
In fact, the Bible says it this way

209
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,139
as the book of Judges is summarized.

210
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,839
In the very last chapter of the book,

211
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,040
in the very last verse,

212
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,339
here in Judges chapter number 21 and verse number 25,

213
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,639
in those days, there was no king in Israel.

214
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,940
Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

215
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,639
There was no authority.

216
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,540
There was no king.

217
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,339
They did what was right in their own eyes.

218
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,540
See, the reality is that man is not basically good.

219
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,940
He is born a sinner, separated from God.

220
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,440
Amen?

221
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
We believe that biblically.

222
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,739
And therefore, we have a situation

223
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:23,540
with the sin of mankind that needs to be addressed.

224
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,140
And the only remedy, as we'll get to at the end of our message this evening,

225
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,540
is the blood of Jesus Christ.

226
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,140
It's the only cure for the problem.

227
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,839
And we find here, all the way back in Genesis chapter number 4,

228
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,040
I'll ask you some questions.

229
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,839
What was the first murder in human history?

230
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,540
We know.

231
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Cain and Abel, right?

232
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,339
It's here in Genesis chapter number 4.

233
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,540
The first murder in human history.

234
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
What did Jesus say?

235
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,940
What was it that proceed out of the heart?

236
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,440
Evil thoughts.

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,739
Murders.

238
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:54,440
Right?

239
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Now, notice in Genesis chapter number 4,

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,540
the Bible tells us in verse number 8,

241
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,040
and Cain talked with Abel as his brother.

242
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,640
His brother.

243
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,839
Amen?

244
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,540
It says this,

245
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
and it came to pass when they were in the field,

246
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,839
that Cain rose up against Abel,

247
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
his brother,

248
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,940
and slew him.

249
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,540
Two times in that verse of Scripture the Bible reminds us

250
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,640
that it's his brother.

251
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,739
Flesh and blood.

252
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:27,640
Brother.

253
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,140
What was it in Cain?

254
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,239
It's a heart issue.

255
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,839
It's a heart issue.

256
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,239
Somehow or another, in his mind, he thought,

257
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,940
because of the offerings that were brought,

258
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,239
and the way in which his offering was not respected or received,

259
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:52,339
he then had anger towards his brother.

260
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:55,739
God plainly said to Cain,

261
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,640
Why art thou wroth?

262
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
He says,

263
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,940
Why is thy countenance fallen, if thou doest well?

264
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,140
Shalt thou not be accepted?

265
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,540
You can read it in verse number 7.

266
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,239
What is God saying to him?

267
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,040
If you come the right way,

268
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,239
if you come the prescribed way,

269
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,140
you'll be accepted.

270
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,839
But instead he just got angry.

271
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,739
And because of his heart,

272
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,040
he killed his brother.

273
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,540
God appears to him and says,

274
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,640
Where is Abel, thy brother?

275
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,540
Am I my brother's keeper?

276
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,040
Right? Is that what it says?

277
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,739
Yeah.

278
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:39,339
What was the problem with Cain?

279
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,040
Heart problem.

280
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,239
Heart problem.

281
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,640
It was his brother.

282
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Killed him.

283
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Look over, if you will, in Genesis 6.

284
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
Let me ask you this.

285
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
How did God describe mankind before the flood

286
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,140
that's recorded here in Genesis 6-8?

287
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,239
Well, God said this,

288
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:00,239
in verse number 5 of Genesis 6,

289
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:04,440
And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,

290
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,540
that every imagination of the thoughts of his, what?

291
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,239
His heart,

292
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:13,940
was only evil continually.

293
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,040
It says in verse number 11,

294
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,339
the earth also was corrupt before God,

295
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,239
and the earth was filled with violence.

296
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:27,739
The Bible doesn't describe for us in complete detail

297
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:31,839
every single thing that was happening in these days prior to the flood,

298
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,640
but we understand even as Jesus would reference it in Matthew chapter 25,

299
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,839
we understand that the wickedness upon the earth

300
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,640
and the earth being filled with violence,

301
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,540
that it was at a point in which God brought divine judgment.

302
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,940
But we see that the Bible tells us in verse number 5 that

303
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,940
every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

304
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,440
was only evil continually.

305
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,839
Let me ask you this question as we kind of fast forward here

306
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,140
a number of generations and think about King David.

307
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,040
What were the two sins of King David as they're recorded in 2 Samuel chapter 11?

308
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,239
Adultery and murder.

309
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,940
What was the list?

310
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,440
What proceeds out of the heart?

311
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,839
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries.

312
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,339
King David was guilty of two of the first three that are mentioned.

313
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,539
By the way, it all started with his look and his thoughts, right?

314
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,239
In fact, it's interesting to note that in 2 Samuel chapter 11,

315
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:41,440
I've often used this comparison as I think about what's going on here,

316
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,239
and you find that the Bible tells at the very beginning of the passage

317
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,840
that David tarried still at Jerusalem.

318
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,440
It was a time when kings went forth to battle.

319
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,539
David was the king, but he tarried in Jerusalem.

320
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,340
And he saw Bathsheba, and he inquired, he asked about her,

321
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,539
and he's told this,

322
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:12,239
"'Is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?'

323
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:16,239
Every time I read verse number 3, in fact, I have in the margin of my Bible,

324
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,739
the response from the servant included the fact that she was a married woman.

325
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:25,840
And the reality is that this warning that was given to the king

326
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,440
was something that he should have taken heed to.

327
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,039
But yet, he did not take heed to the warning.

328
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
His immediate response is, "'Bring her to me.'"

329
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,739
And we understand what happens.

330
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:43,239
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

331
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,140
He commits the transgression of adultery.

332
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,739
He finds that it's resulted in conception.

333
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,239
So what does he do?

334
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,640
We need to try to cover this thing up somehow.

335
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,340
Right?

336
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,460
Uriah, come back from the battle.

337
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,300
He tries to get Uriah to go home.

338
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,840
Uriah demonstrated more integrity

339
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,240
in this passage of Scripture

340
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,020
than most other examples of integrity

341
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,060
that you'll find throughout the Scriptures.

342
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,680
What a great level of integrity.

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
David went through a number of iterations

344
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,200
of trying to get Uriah to go home.

345
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,620
And eventually, David writes a letter

346
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,400
and hands that letter to Uriah

347
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,520
that contained his death sentence.

348
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah? Am I telling it right?

349
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,760
Do I need to read it all?

350
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,040
That's it.

351
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,520
Takes it to Joab, right?

352
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
What happens?

353
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
Joab then sends him to the place

354
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,560
where he knew he'd die.

355
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
And it's interesting when Joab

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,840
is going to tell the servant

357
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,200
to go back and to let the king know

358
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,040
how the battle fared,

359
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,280
he told him this at the end of v. 21.

360
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,680
Make sure you tell them,

361
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,080
thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

362
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,960
Because the news he was going to bring,

363
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,200
there were other casualties that were involved.

364
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,240
And unless the king would say,

365
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,520
well, didn't you know that this would happen?

366
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,920
I mean, you went to this place

367
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
and didn't you have this?

368
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,040
He said just make sure you let them know

369
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,000
that Uriah is dead.

370
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And it's interesting,

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,280
when David hears that,

372
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,080
he says this in v. 25,

373
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,160
"'Let not this thing displease Thee,

374
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,800
for the sword devoureth one as well as another.

375
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,960
Make Thy battle more strong against the city

376
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,520
and overthrow it,

377
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,000
and encourage Thou him.'"

378
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,200
David had a heart problem.

379
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,120
Amen?

380
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,520
It's interesting to me

381
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,880
that one of the things that is recorded for us

382
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,560
in the Psalm of Confession,

383
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,520
turn over to Psalm 51 if you will,

384
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,880
one of the requests that is made

385
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,520
by David of course in the passage there

386
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,840
back in 2 Samuel,

387
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,000
we find that it's in chapter 12

388
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,080
when the Lord sends Nathan unto David.

389
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,160
And Nathan, the prophet, stands before him

390
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,000
and gives him a parable to start

391
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,080
and then lets him know,

392
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,560
thou art the man.

393
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm thankful that David responded properly.

394
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,360
We read Psalm 51

395
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,560
and what a great psalm of repentance it is.

396
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,560
We find that he says,

397
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
"'Have mercy upon me.'"

398
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,560
In verse 1,

399
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,120
"'O God, according to Thy lovingkindness,

400
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,320
according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies,

401
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,800
blot out my transgressions.'

402
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,160
Jared sang a song this morning."

403
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,400
What was the title of that song?

404
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,080
My Confession.

405
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,800
What a beautiful song.

406
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,960
I'd never heard that song before

407
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,560
until he started practicing it.

408
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm so thankful that our God is

409
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,080
a loving, kind, compassionate God

410
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,560
who's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

411
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,040
He says, "'Wash me throughly

412
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
from mine iniquity

413
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,200
and cleanse me from my sin.

414
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,840
For I acknowledge my transgressions.

415
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
My sin is ever before me.

416
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,680
Against Thee, Thee only have I sinned

417
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,320
and done this evil in Thy sight,

418
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,720
that Thou mightest be justified

419
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,640
when Thou speakest

420
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,800
and be clear when Thou judgest.'"

421
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,120
We don't have time to read the entirety of it,

422
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,160
but I want you to notice a specific request

423
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,320
that is made by David in this passage of Scripture,

424
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
this psalm of confession.

425
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,160
He says in verse 10,

426
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,600
"'Create in me a clean heart,

427
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,920
create in me a clean heart, O God,

428
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,440
and renew a right spirit within me.

429
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,280
Cast me not away from Thy presence

430
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

431
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation

432
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,560
and uphold me with Thy free spirit.'"

433
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,840
If we were preaching an entire message

434
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,000
on this passage of Scripture,

435
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,040
we'd take each of these phrases apart

436
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,440
and deal with them.

437
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,880
Suffice it to say this evening

438
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
that he asks the question,

439
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
he makes the request,

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,280
create in me a clean heart, O God.

441
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,200
It's of interest that he says

442
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,880
and very important for us to understand

443
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,040
and as we have the entirety of the Scriptures

444
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,560
and we have the truth of the New Testament

445
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,720
and understanding the truth of eternal life,

446
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,720
he says, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

447
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
He didn't say he needed to be saved again.

448
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,480
He lost his joy.

449
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,560
Everybody loses joy because of sin.

450
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Sin will steal your joy.

451
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
It was D.L. Moody that said

452
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
sin will keep you from this book

453
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,920
or this book will keep you from sin.

454
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,760
The reality is that sin will steal your joy.

455
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,000
And David said, restore unto me

456
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,240
the joy of my salvation.

457
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,440
But before he says that,

458
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,440
he says, create in me a clean heart, O God.

459
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
On at least five occasions,

460
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,640
the exposure of Israel or really Judah in particular

461
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,240
during the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah,

462
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,720
there's many indictments against Judah

463
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,200
that are contained within the book of Jeremiah.

464
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
On at least five occasions

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,400
in the first several chapters of that great book,

466
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,200
it is said of the people of Judah

467
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,640
that they had an evil heart.

468
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
An evil heart.

469
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,640
And they were doing after the imaginations

470
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,080
of their evil heart.

471
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,600
If you were to understand and begin to study

472
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,040
and look at all that was taking place

473
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,480
during the time of Judah

474
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,280
on the eve of their captivity,

475
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,560
and you'd understand the sin and the idolatry

476
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,640
and the wickedness that they were involved in and engaged in,

477
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,080
you would see why God would indict them

478
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,000
by telling them that they had an evil heart.

479
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,520
It's interesting as you look at the book of Jeremiah

480
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,560
again on the eve of captivity,

481
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
and you understand what's going on,

482
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,560
and it's interesting if you go

483
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,280
and you take the truth of Jeremiah

484
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,760
here in chapter number two of the book,

485
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,120
and you think about what Jesus was dealing with

486
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,480
with those religious leaders back in Matthew 15.

487
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,320
Remember they were concerned about the washing of the hands,

488
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,800
eating without washing the hands and so on and so forth.

489
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,720
And Jesus is gonna direct them to the issue of their heart.

490
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,240
And he speaks about the prophecy of Isaiah,

491
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,400
which is extremely valid of them saying,

492
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,040
they draw near to me with their lips,

493
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,160
but their heart is far from me.

494
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,080
Listen, God is always concerned about your heart.

495
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,400
He's concerned about the heart.

496
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,680
We find here in the book of Jeremiah in chapter number two,

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,160
and again, we don't have time to read all of it,

498
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,680
but the indictment is given in verse number 11,

499
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
hath a nation changed their gods,

500
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,400
which are yet no gods,

501
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
but my people have changed their glory

502
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,920
for that which it doth not profit.

503
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this,

504
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,360
and be horribly afraid.

505
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,000
Be very desolate, saith the Lord,

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,800
for my people have committed two evils.

507
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,560
They have forsaken me for the fountain of living waters

508
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,120
and hewed them out cisterns,

509
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,000
broken cisterns that can hold no water.

510
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,360
In verse 17, hast thou not procured this unto thyself

511
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,160
in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God

512
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,440
when He led thee by the way?

513
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
Notice verse 19, thine own wickedness shall correct thee

514
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,840
and thy backsliding shall reprove thee.

515
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,280
Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing

516
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,360
and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God

517
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
and that my fear is not in thee,

518
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,320
saith the Lord God of hosts.

519
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,000
Skip down and look at verse 22.

520
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,400
For though thou wash thee with niter

521
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
and take thee much soap,

522
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,520
yet thine iniquity is marked before me,

523
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
saith the Lord God.

524
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,760
They couldn't just wash up and clean up

525
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,160
and look, no, no, they had a heart issue.

526
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,280
And there was nothing that could be done on the outward

527
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,520
that was gonna clean it up and fix it.

528
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,920
We understand from 1 Samuel 16, right?

529
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,080
Remember when Samuel goes,

530
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,640
he's gonna anoint the next king.

531
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,840
He'd been given the direction of the Lord

532
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,760
and God had told Samuel,

533
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,840
you go to the house of Jesse

534
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,520
and you're gonna anoint the next king, right?

535
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Eliab is the first one that stands before him.

536
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,280
Surely this is he.

537
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,000
Is that not Samuel's response, right?

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,800
But God says, nope, not him.

539
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,840
Number two, number three, number four,

540
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,560
number five, number six.

541
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

542
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Jesse is there.

543
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,840
Samuel says, are these all your sons?

544
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
Well, there's another one.

545
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,480
He's out in the field.

546
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,840
They didn't even bring him.

547
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,080
What'd he say?

548
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,240
Send for him.

549
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,000
They didn't sit down until he came.

550
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
You find that there in 1 Samuel 16,

551
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,840
that as soon as David is coming,

552
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,040
that God lets Samuel know,

553
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,880
that's the one.

554
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
That's the one.

555
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,160
He's the one that you're to anoint

556
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,400
and he pours oil on him.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
He anoints him.

558
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,000
It's interesting that within the text of Scripture,

559
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,840
right after he saw Eliab,

560
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,480
he looked on him and he said,

561
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,000
surely the Lord's anointed is before him.

562
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,400
But God showed Samuel a great lesson

563
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,840
and recorded it for us in His Word.

564
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,800
The Lord said unto Samuel in verse seven of 1 Samuel 16,

565
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,320
look not on his countenance

566
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,680
or on the height of his stature.

567
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,520
Why?

568
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
Because I have refused him.

569
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,680
For the Lord seeth not as man seeth.

570
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,360
For man looketh on the outward appearance,

571
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,800
but the Lord looketh on the heart.

572
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,880
There are two truths that we can take

573
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,120
from this passage of Scripture.

574
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,600
Number one, man can only see the outward,

575
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,840
so the outward is important.

576
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,880
We don't discount and just dismiss the outward

577
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,559
because when God sees the heart.

578
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,280
No, all other man can see is the outward, right?

579
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,520
So the outward's important.

580
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,720
But we understand that we don't make those decisions

581
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,559
that God makes because God looketh on the heart.

582
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,320
He says, you can try to clean it all up.

583
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,160
What are you talking about?

584
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Jesus talked about the whited sepulchers, right?

585
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Who are they?

586
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,760
They're filled with dead men's bones.

587
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
They look good on the outside, cleaned up.

588
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,120
Bunch of dead men's bones in there, right?

589
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,400
And so we find that as we look at the truth

590
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,040
of the Word of God and we see this.

591
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,360
various examples in the Old Testament

592
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,800
of this heart issue.

593
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
And we find that the works of the flesh,

594
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,880
as I mentioned a moment ago,

595
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,120
go over to Galatians 5, if you will.

596
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,280
And as you look in Galatians 5,

597
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,240
I want you to consider

598
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,200
these 19 things that are given to us

599
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,720
as the works of the flesh.

600
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
Now it's interesting, as we begin to see

601
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
that the Bible says the works of the flesh are manifest.

602
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,160
Here's how they are manifest.

603
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,840
Here's how they're known, right?

604
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
He goes through this list and he reveals it to us.

605
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,720
He says, these are the works of the flesh.

606
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,680
This is the natural man.

607
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,120
This is the wicked heart.

608
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
Remember what Paul said.

609
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,840
We studied through the book of Ephesians last year.

610
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,400
We went through the entire book in our morning services

611
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,920
and we preached and had the theme, be strong in the Lord.

612
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,360
Remember that Paul made this statement

613
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
in Ephesians chapter number two.

614
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,360
Stay there in Galatians.

615
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,680
But he said, where in time past

616
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,120
you walked according to the course of this world,

617
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
according to the prince of the power of the air,

618
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
the spirit that outworketh

619
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,720
and the children of disobedience,

620
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,720
among whom also we all had our conversation in time past

621
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,160
in the lust of our flesh,

622
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,760
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind

623
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,560
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

624
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Praise God for verse number four,

625
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,520
but God who is rich in mercy.

626
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,200
We don't have time to deal with all of Ephesians

627
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,040
chapter number two,

628
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,720
but you see the desires of the flesh, right?

629
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,320
Here we see the works of the flesh

630
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
as they're described to us in Galatians chapter number five.

631
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
I believe that this list that is provided to us

632
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,200
further proves the evil and wicked behavior of mankind

633
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
is a heart problem.

634
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,000
Paul starts out in verse number 16 by saying,

635
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
this I say then, walk in the spirit

636
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,400
and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

637
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,720
We're gonna come back to that thought here

638
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
in just a few moments.

639
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,080
Notice it says the flesh lusteth against the spirit,

640
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
the spirit against the flesh,

641
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,480
and these are contrary the one to the other

642
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,880
so that you cannot do the things that you would.

643
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,400
But if you be led of the spirit, you're not under the law.

644
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,760
Now understand, before we get into verse number 19,

645
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,680
understand a very important truth

646
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
as we get into this passage.

647
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,320
The book of Galatians is written to whom?

648
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,260
It's written to the churches in the region of Galatia.

649
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,080
There were four churches that were planted

650
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,760
during the first missionary journey of the apostle Paul.

651
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,520
He left the church in Antioch.

652
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,560
He was sent out, first went to Antioch and Pisidia,

653
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,240
then he went to Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

654
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,360
And in those cities, churches were established.

655
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,440
He's now writing back to those churches.

656
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,280
Why?

657
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,080
Because there were some proselytes that came in,

658
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,200
there was all kinds of things going on,

659
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
excuse me, Judaizers that came in,

660
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,280
and these Judaizers, all the things that were going on,

661
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,040
legalism, so on and so forth,

662
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,960
and we find that here that the apostle Paul

663
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,000
is writing to these believers, right, these churches.

664
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,760
The church is, a church is made up of saved membership,

665
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,080
right, we believe that in order to be a member

666
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,120
of a local church that you have to be saved and baptized.

667
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,320
And so we find here that he says,

668
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,640
"'Walk in the Spirit, you shall not

669
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,600
"'fulfill the lust of the flesh.

670
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,280
"'The flesh lusteth against the Spirit.'"

671
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,260
For us this evening as saved people,

672
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,700
have we experienced this?

673
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,440
Have you experienced your flesh and your spirit

674
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,480
being enmity one against the other?

675
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,120
Have you experienced the way that Paul described it

676
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
in Romans when he said,

677
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,360
the things that I would, I do not,

678
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,840
the things that I would not, that I do,

679
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,240
that's the flesh and the spirit

680
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,000
contrary one to the other.

681
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,040
Have you experienced it?

682
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,160
Guess what?

683
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,560
If you're lost, you don't have the Spirit of God

684
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,260
living within you and you don't have that enmity.

685
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Amen?

686
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,360
Amen.

687
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,400
The reality is that Ephesians 1

688
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,920
shares with us the plan of redemption

689
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
that before the foundation of the world,

690
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,200
God had a plan to redeem fallen mankind.

691
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,320
He shares with us what the price would be

692
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,220
for that redemption.

693
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,520
It's the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

694
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,180
And he tells us what the proof of our redemption is.

695
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,000
It's the Holy Spirit of God.

696
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,280
Amen?

697
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,680
We find that the Bible tells us

698
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,700
that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

699
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,700
which is in you.

700
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,020
What you have of God.

701
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,860
You're not your own.

702
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,140
You're bought with the price.

703
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,940
And the reality is that I have no Holy Spirit

704
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,800
until I get saved.

705
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,380
At the moment of conversion,

706
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,740
immediately, I didn't understand all of this

707
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,860
when I got saved 20 some years ago.

708
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,580
But at the moment of salvation,

709
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,320
the Holy Spirit of God indwelled me.

710
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,600
If you're saved this evening,

711
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,500
the Holy Spirit of God indwelled you.

712
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,380
And you have all the Holy Spirit you're ever going to get.

713
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,660
He doesn't have all of us,

714
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,600
but we have all of Him.

715
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,420
That's why Paul would say in there,

716
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,460
in the book of Ephesians,

717
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,000
to be filled with the Spirit.

718
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,060
The idea of that continual filling.

719
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,900
Why?

720
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,620
Because we get filled up of ourselves,

721
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,580
and we get filled up, right?

722
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,000
But we need to be filled with the Spirit.

723
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,940
We have all of Him when we're indwelled by Him.

724
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,860
That's the proof of our redemption.

725
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,260
But as we look at Galatians 5,

726
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,380
we have to understand something this evening

727
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,400
that as we look at this

728
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,060
and we understand these works of the flesh,

729
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,820
and we understand how they're going to be manifest

730
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
in the list that God's gonna give us here,

731
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,660
that the lost person, the unregenerate person,

732
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,060
they don't have the Spirit of God convicting them.

733
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,800
They don't have that enmity.

734
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,460
They just have a heart of unregenerate heart

735
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,760
that Ephesians chapter number two says

736
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,260
that they're going to simply fulfill

737
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,580
the lust and the desires of their flesh.

738
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,420
Why?

739
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,240
Because they're lost.

740
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,860
They're lost.

741
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,780
Galatians 5, look at the works of the flesh.

742
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,020
Verse number 19, it begins,

743
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,460
now the works of the flesh are manifest.

744
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,800
Which are these?

745
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,760
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,

746
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,980
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,

747
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,180
hatred, variance, emulations,

748
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,100
wrath, strife, seditions, heresies.

749
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,460
Verse 21, envyings, murders,

750
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,940
drunkenness, revelings, and such like.

751
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,220
Of the witch I tell you before

752
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,340
as I have also told you in time past

753
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,780
that they which do such things

754
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,860
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

755
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,560
Verse 22 starts with a conjunction,

756
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,900
but the fruit of the Spirit.

757
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,700
Oh, what a lovely list it is.

758
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
Amen?

759
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,460
The fruit of the Spirit, love, joy,

760
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,780
peace, longsuffering, gentleness,

761
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,940
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.

762
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,060
Against such there is no law, right?

763
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,580
So we see the works of the flesh manifest.

764
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,220
I believe, again, as I mentioned,

765
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,860
that this list further proves

766
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,300
that the evil and wicked behavior of mankind

767
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,780
is a heart problem.

768
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,100
It was a heart problem in Genesis chapter number four.

769
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,180
It was a heart problem in Genesis chapter number six.

770
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,900
It was a heart problem in 2 Samuel chapter number 11.

771
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,740
It was a heart problem throughout the book of Judges.

772
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,340
A heart problem, I mean, we could go on

773
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,260
all sorts of illustrations this evening

774
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,220
of what we find is a heart problem

775
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,340
when Jesus was dealing with the religious leaders.

776
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
They were lost.

777
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,860
They had a hard heart.

778
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,140
They had a heart problem.

779
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,420
If we're not careful, even as believers,

780
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,820
we can have a heart problem.

781
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,860
And we understand that,

782
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,080
really kind of a situation we deal with in another context,

783
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,280
but this evening, as we think about these things

784
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,560
that have been given to us, I ask this question,

785
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,280
then what is the remedy?

786
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,000
There's only one remedy for the heart problem of mankind.

787
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,440
And that remedy is redemption

788
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,160
through the blood of Jesus Christ.

789
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,020
Transformation, not reformation.

790
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,920
Amen?

791
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,580
We're not trying to go through some kind of step process

792
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,200
of whatever and clean the man up.

793
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,080
No, we wanna have the truth of the gospel,

794
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
which is the power of God unto salvation.

795
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,440
And Paul declares, you think about the Apostle Paul

796
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,360
in Acts chapter nine, when he's still referred to as Saul,

797
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,320
before his conversion, he's got letters of authority

798
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,520
in his hands to go and to take any of that way,

799
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,720
which refers to those that would be believers,

800
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,480
followers of Jesus Christ, come to be called Christians

801
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,960
by the church in Antioch,

802
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,280
and we find that he has the authority, he has the letters,

803
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,720
he's done various things.

804
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,000
He's been consulting unto the death of many people,

805
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,440
taking them and all of these things.

806
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,120
He had a, I mean, people knew about him.

807
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,920
And then he's preaching Christ

808
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,880
by the end of the chapter.

809
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,720
What happened?

810
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,600
Here's what he declares in 2 Corinthians five,

811
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,360
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

812
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,480
Old things are passed away,

813
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
behold, all things are become new.

814
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,080
You know what we need?

815
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
We need people to go out and preach the gospel.

816
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,000
It's amazing to me that the church,

817
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
you know, the church, Paul says this,

818
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,240
that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

819
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,080
Right?

820
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,280
We have the truth of God's word.

821
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,440
And we have the responsibility to take the truth

822
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,680
of the word of God and deliver that message

823
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,480
to a lost and dying world.

824
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,040
And we see all of these things.

825
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,320
We see the works of the flesh.

826
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,360
We see the heart of mankind being revealed to us

827
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,840
through all of the things that are going on in our society.

828
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,240
And we say, have people sitting around

829
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,680
and trying to figure out what is it that we can do?

830
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,560
How can we come up with new programs?

831
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,880
What new thing can we do?

832
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,560
What millions of dollars can we spend over here?

833
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,040
How can we do this?

834
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
Preach the book.

835
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,400
But guess what?

836
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
They removed the book.

837
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,080
As a society, we made decisions

838
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
in the Supreme Court.

839
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,760
Can't have prayer, Bible, in school.

840
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,520
Some of you grew up in school when you read the Bible.

841
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,160
in school. I didn't grow up at that era, but some of you remember being in school,

842
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:12,400
public school, reading the Bible. No, we want to remove God. You can't speak about

843
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:21,840
God. You can't. And then we got what we have today, right? If you read Romans 1,

844
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,120
you'll see it's the, I mean, it's just the devil has no new tricks, okay? That's just

845
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,840
the situation we're dealing with today really is laid out for us in Romans 1, and we see

846
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,480
that. But let me talk about the remedy. Let me read a few passages of scripture to you.

847
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,560
Romans 6. Romans 6, and I need to hurry. I just got a few passages to read to you. Romans

848
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:54,360
6. Begin looking at verse number, let's read verse 17. Verse 16, let's read there first.

849
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,400
Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to

850
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,920
whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. But God be

851
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,560
thanked that ye were the servants of sin. Speaking about past tense, right? This is

852
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,560
what you were. You were the servants of sin. We all can identify there, right? What did

853
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,200
Paul say in Philippians chapter number two? Excuse me, Ephesians chapter number two. We

854
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,880
all had our conversation there. We all were lost. We're all in the same boat, right? But

855
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,120
thank God that he's rich in mercy. And we heard the gospel, we responded to the gospel,

856
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,120
and we trusted Christ our Savior. He says, but God be thanked that ye were the servants

857
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,440
of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered

858
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:53,360
you being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. See, sometimes

859
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,680
we get mad at a sinner because they sin. But we have to recognize this if we read the entirety

860
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:08,200
here of Romans chapter number six, the reality that they are bound by their sin. Amen? They

861
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,440
are bound by their sin. I am thankful that I have been set free. You notice it says in

862
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,360
verse number 14, for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but

863
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,440
under grace. Listen, we've often said that at the moment of salvation that we are delivered

864
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,080
from the penalty of sin. What's the penalty of sin? Death. Amen? The wage of sin is death.

865
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,840
I'm thankful to be delivered from the penalty of sin, that second death, right? He says

866
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,200
this with regard to death and hell were cast in the lake of fire. This is the second death

867
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,080
in Revelation chapter 20. I've been delivered from that. I've been delivered from the power

868
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,240
of sin. Does it mean that we don't sin? No. But we should sin a whole lot less. I'm not

869
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
bound by sin anymore. I've been delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit of God that

870
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,520
lives within me, who gives me the opportunity to have victory that allows me to walk in

871
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,720
the Spirit so that I do not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Amen? I didn't have that when

872
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:15,440
I was lost. But I'm not yet delivered from the presence of sin. One day I'll be in heaven

873
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,360
and so will you. There'll be no more sin. Won't it be wonderful? But we find that here

874
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:31,480
are some that are still the servants of sin. And guess what? As a servant of sin with a

875
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:40,800
heart that is unregenerate, what proceeds out of that heart? We read it in Matthew 15.

876
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,720
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, right? You read it. The works of the flesh

877
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,600
are these, right? The works of the flesh are manifest, and here's what they are. So if

878
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,600
you're a servant of sin, if you're unregenerate, that's the behavior that you're going to expect.

879
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,160
But those that have believed from the heart, that have obeyed from the heart that form

880
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,680
of the doctrine which was delivered to you, what's that? The Gospel, right? What did Paul

881
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,040
say in the very beginning of this letter? I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.

882
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,920
It was the power of God unto salvation, right? He said that he was ready to preach. He was

883
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,240
a debtor. And we understand that as he's speaking here, he says, you believe the Gospel, therefore

884
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,640
you were a servant of sin, but now you're a servant of righteousness. Isn't that wonderful

885
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:34,120
to be a servant of righteousness? No longer to have to be a servant of sin. To have that

886
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,240
chain and ball of sin attached to us and we can't help but just do this. No. But thanks

887
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,920
be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Now we can be a servant

888
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,400
of righteousness, not a servant of sin. 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, turn over there.

889
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,600
Who's Paul writing to? He's writing to some saved people, the church in Corinth. Oh, there's

890
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,360
some carnal people, but there's some saved people. Amen? The reality is that he writes

891
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,040
here in 1 Corinthians and as he's writing these people, I mean, there's divisions and

892
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,160
all sorts of things going on and what have you, but we find that he's writing to them.

893
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,920
Notice in verse number 9 in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, know ye not that the unrighteous

894
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,000
shall not inherit the kingdom of God, be not deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters,

895
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,200
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor

896
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,360
covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of

897
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:36,360
God. And such were some of you. But, aren't you so thankful for that little conjunction?

898
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,520
But, ye are washed. We sing the song, Are You Washed? In the blood. In the soul-cleansing

899
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,680
blood of the Lamb. When we sing that song in the chorus, when it says, Are You Washed?

900
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,680
I like to say, Yes I am. Amen? I don't know how to sing another part and do the harmony

901
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,800
and all that stuff, but man, I like to say, Yes I am. It's a question, Are You Washed?

902
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Paul says, Ye are washed. But, you're sanctified. But, you're justified. In the name of the

903
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Oh, thank God for redemption. How he changed

904
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,480
our lives. We can testify this evening that I'm not the man I used to be. My perfect

905
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:42,320
no. I'm so thankful for 1 John 2, that I have an advocate with the Father. Jesus Christ

906
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:50,160
the Righteous. Amen? What a blessing. Here in Galatians 5, we end here. We were here

907
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,400
earlier looking at the works of the flesh, but notice he says in verse 16, But this I

908
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,400
say. This I say then, walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

909
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,080
The only person that can obey the instruction of verse 16 is a saved person. I cannot stand

910
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:19,080
up and preach a message to a lost crowd. If I receive an invitation, there are times in

911
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,160
which I've preached in settings where I have believed that apart from me and my wife on

912
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,520
one occasion, there were one other person here that I knew of, there were 3 saved people.

913
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,740
There was another occasion that I preached, and as far as I was aware, I was the only

914
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:44,540
saved person there. Holly wasn't there. I was by myself. As far as I knew, I was the

915
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:50,180
only saved person. I would never in that setting open up Galatians 5 and verse 16 and say,

916
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:57,180
walk in the Spirit. They can't. What's the message I need to deliver them? Ye must be

917
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,180
born again. Right? Ye must be born again. Is that what Jesus said to Nicodemus? Jesus

918
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,700
didn't say to Nicodemus, walk in the Spirit. Jesus didn't tell Nicodemus to do that. No.

919
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:17,700
He said, ye must be born again. When Paul went on his missionary journeys, did he preach

920
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:26,420
walk in the Spirit? No, he preached the Gospel. Then, after they were saved, he taught them

921
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,100
how to walk. Read the book of Ephesians, the first 3 chapters. He deals with their conversion,

922
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,940
their position in Christ. Then, beginning in chapter 4, 5 and 6, he talks about their

923
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,820
walk. Now that you're saved, here's how you walk. You don't tell a lost person how to

924
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:47,660
clean up their life and how to walk. They can't serve God. They're lost. So, what's

925
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:54,660
the problem in our society? A lot of lost people. It's always been that way, though.

926
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:02,460
What's the solution? Go buy a ranch somewhere in Idaho and hide under the hills? No. Preach

927
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:09,460
the Gospel. Amen? It's the power of God unto salvation. Did it work for you? It worked

928
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:20,420
for me. It worked for my dad. I only use that example because I was almost 13 years old

929
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:27,420
when he got saved. Guess what? As a 13 year old, you know when something happens. Amen?

930
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:33,260
I don't need to go into all the details. What I'm saying is that the Gospel worked in that

931
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:40,260
man's life. I saw it. I didn't understand it. I understand it a whole lot more today

932
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:48,340
than I did then. It worked in my life. It worked in your life. Why wouldn't we think

933
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:55,780
it would work in somebody else's life? It is the power of God unto salvation. That word

934
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,540
power is a nice word. It's a word that we get our word dynamite.

935
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,980
dynamite for, right?

936
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,460
The Greek word is the same Greek word that we get our word dynamite from.

937
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,460
Dynamite's pretty powerful.

938
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,460
Amen?

939
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,460
You want to blow something up, Dean?

940
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,460
Blow something up?

941
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,340
He's always talking about guns and bullets and all that kind of stuff.

942
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,300
Get some dynamite, amen?

943
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Blow something up.

944
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,300
You understand what I'm saying, though?

945
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,900
Listen, we have the answer.

946
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,900
We have the remedy.

947
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,660
We have the cure.

948
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,100
And we run around and we look at all these things that are going on in our society, and

949
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,500
we're listening to all of these talking heads say all of the things that they're saying

950
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,260
on how they're going to fix this and fix that and do this and do that, and we need more

951
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,900
of this, and we need the gospel.

952
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:53,260
We're never going to clean up society apart from man being converted.

953
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,060
Why?

954
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,020
Because the heart of the matter is a matter of the heart.

955
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,700
We've got a heart problem.

956
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,700
And the only thing...

957
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:10,140
See, God made this promise in Ezekiel, really to the Jews, to Israel, that He would create

958
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,320
in them a clean heart, a new heart, a fleshly heart.

959
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
He will do that.

960
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,580
But see, the Jews, Israel rejected Jesus as Messiah.

961
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,300
They were set aside.

962
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,540
The Gentiles were grafted in.

963
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
And guess what?

964
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,660
Now, because of the beauty of salvation, when we get saved, we get that clean heart.

965
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,460
We get that new heart.

966
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,500
What a beautiful thing.

967
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,700
A servant of righteousness or a servant of sin?

968
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,460
Walk in the Spirit?

969
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,240
I can't expect a lost person to do that.

970
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,620
I need to give them the gospel.

971
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:54,660
This evening, I hope that we would be motivated to understand that it's a heart problem and

972
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,700
that as believers, we have the answer.

973
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,380
We just need to go and take the gospel.

974
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,300
I understand it's not the most popular thing.

975
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
People aren't ready to receive it.

976
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,580
I understand that.

977
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,860
But I don't think there's probably ever been a time in human history that they were ready

978
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,100
to receive it.

979
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,100
You know why?

980
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,100
It's a spiritual battle.

981
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,660
Brother, you're going to Uganda.

982
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,380
People ask missionaries all the time this question.

983
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,540
I've never been a missionary, but I've heard a lot of missionaries get asked questions.

984
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,220
Are the people in the field that you're going to receptive to the gospel?

985
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,180
I've heard that question I don't know how many times.

986
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,380
You'll receive that question, no doubt.

987
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,420
Are they receptive?

988
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,160
The reality is that the gospel's confrontational.

989
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,860
We can use a subjective scale to determine the openness and the receptivity of a certain

990
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,620
group of people versus another group of people and so on and so forth, and we can deal with

991
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,620
that.

992
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:57,700
But the reality at the end of the day is that the gospel is confrontational, and we must

993
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:02,080
be willing to confront somebody with their need for Christ.

994
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,220
I hope this evening that each and every person that's here knows the Lord Jesus Christ as

995
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:14,800
their personal Savior, that you've been born again, that you no longer are under the penalty

996
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,360
of sin.

997
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,320
You've understood that Jesus is the only Savior.

998
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,920
We sing the song with the kids, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way.

999
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,640
No other way, no other way.

1000
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,880
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, for by grace we are saved through faith,

1001
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,360
not of works as any man should boast, right?

1002
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Thank God for his mercy and his grace.

1003
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,400
If you're not saved this evening, let me take a Bible and show you how you can know for

1004
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,020
sure that heaven's your home.

1005
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,500
If you know the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior tonight, I hope that we would be able

1006
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:56,420
to walk away saying, there's a heart problem in our society, in our world, and the only

1007
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:02,100
cure is Jesus, the only cure is Jesus.

1008
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,380
And we have been allowed of God, to use the words of Paul, that he says to the church

1009
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,340
in Thessalonica, we have been allowed of God to preach the gospel.

1010
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,420
And what a unique privilege that is.

1011
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,660
Don't misunderstand it, you have a responsibility as well.

1012
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,180
Because Jesus said, go and preach the gospel to every creature.

1013
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,260
We've been given a unique privilege.

1014
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,740
We've been given a responsibility.

1015
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,180
We have the answer, and the answer is Jesus.

1016
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,180
Let's pray.

1017
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
Father, we love you this evening.

1018
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,100
We thank you for loving us.

1019
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,420
Thank you for the Word of God.

1020
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:46,740
This evening, as we've surveyed through many portions of Scripture, bounced back and forth,

1021
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:54,620
I trust that there's been a level of continuity that's helped us to acknowledge this evening

1022
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:59,060
there's a heart problem.

1023
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:05,900
The only way to address that problem is with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

1024
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:10,060
God if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, I pray that you would help them tonight

1025
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,700
Lord, to understand their need for Christ.

1026
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,740
They would not leave without knowing for sure, that if they were to die, that they'd go to heaven.

1027
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:26,140
Lord, I pray that every believer would be challenged this evening to understand that

1028
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:33,500
the greatest cause that we can be engaged in is the cause of preaching the gospel of

1029
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Jesus Christ.

1030
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,580
It's the only hope for mankind.

1031
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,380
God, I pray that we would be faithful, that we would acknowledge as the Apostle Paul did

1032
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:50,220
as he's writing to the church there in Rome, the believers in Rome, that he was debtor,

1033
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,500
he was ready, he was not ashamed.

1034
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,380
Help us Lord, I pray.

1035
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,980
Have your will and way in this moment of invitation.

1036
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,100
Help us to respond.

1037
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,140
Help us God to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

1038
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
We'll thank you for it.

1039
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,140
In Christ's name we pray.

1040
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,140
Amen.
