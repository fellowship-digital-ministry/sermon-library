WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.679
this evening, Matthew 15. I'm going to take a couple of verses of Scripture here from

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:11.199
this 15th chapter of the book of Matthew and look at these verses and then we're going

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:18.000
to spend much time in various portions of the Word of God this evening. And the Bible

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.639
speaks often about the heart of man. And we find that throughout the Scriptures there

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:31.040
are many references to the heart of man. In fact, we find many descriptive terms that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.080
are used in order to address the heart of man. In our text of Scripture here in Matthew

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.040
15 in verse number 18, the Bible says, but those things which proceed out of the mouth

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.720
come forth from the heart and they defile the man. Now, you understand that as we look

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.240
through the passage of Scripture here that Jesus is speaking to these religious leaders

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.500
and they make a statement in verse number two. It says, why do thy disciples transgress

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.639
the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread? How many

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:12.440
of you heard your parents say, wash your hands before you eat, right? And these religious

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.400
leaders, they're saying, hey, you're disciples, they're not washing their hands and so on

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.720
and so forth. And we see that the Lord begins to deal with them on the heart of the matter.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.040
He starts discussing their heart and he goes through and he tells them various things.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.680
He tells them in verse number, let's just pick it in verse number five, but you say,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.300
whosoever shall say to his father, his mother, it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.879
profited by me and honor not his father, his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:46.440
the commandment of God of none effect. How? By your tradition, ye hypocrites. Well, did

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.239
Isaiah the prophet say, or Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me

00:01:53.239 --> 00:02:00.680
with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips. Notice this, but their heart is far

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.240
from me, but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines, the commandments of men. He

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.520
called the multitude and said unto them, hear and understand. We find that as Jesus

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.080
is teaching them, he says in verse number 13, but he answered and said, every plant

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.919
which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone, they be

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.520
blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.759
Then answered Peter and said unto him, declare unto us this parable. And Jesus said, are

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:36.039
you also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:41.520
in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the drought. But those things

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.199
which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man. Notice

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:58.119
verse 19 for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:05.279
thefts, false witnesses, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man. But to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.839
eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man. Every young boy's favorite verse of scripture.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.839
But look, as we look at the passage of scripture and we understand what Jesus is saying here

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.119
and as he's dealing with the heart of the matter, we find that it's interesting how

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:28.559
that we noticed the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ and we couple it with what the

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.880
proverb declares in Proverbs four and verse number 23, the Bible says, keep thy heart

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.399
with all diligence. For out of it, out of the heart, what does the Bible say? Are the

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:47.759
issues of life, right? And so for out of it are the issues of life. And so we think about

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:55.119
keeping my heart with all diligence and the important aspect as we find here, I've often

00:03:55.119 --> 00:04:00.800
said as I've interacted with people over the years that this is a heart issue. This is

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.160
a heart issue. I've had times in which I've spoken to individuals and they've shared things

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.639
with me that I would never repeat things of just gross immorality of just things that

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.679
they've been involved with and so on and so forth. And I've tried to explain to them that

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:23.179
there's a heart issue and they need in this particular or in these situations, what they

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:28.839
really need is salvation. Begin to deal with that. But see, they can go somewhere and they

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:35.959
can find someone that will diagnose them with some type of a situation and they just go

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:41.679
ahead and they just say, well, then this is just, I'm addicted to this, that or the other

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:47.559
because someone will say that. And I say, no, no, it's a heart issue. It's a heart issue.

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:54.559
And we find here that in the text of scripture that Jesus says out of the heart proceed.

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.799
Now, we are going to look at these things here in just a moment, but I want you to understand

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:06.600
that as we notice these verses of scripture here in Matthew 15, Proverbs 4 and verse 23,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.959
it's very easy for us to look at a number of other verses of scripture that deal with

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:16.000
the heart and we can easily conclude that God is not speaking about the organ that beats

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
in my chest. Amen? That's what he's talking about. We find that as it would be a heart

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.600
can be defined by Webster in the 1828 Webster's dictionary, that what he's speaking of is

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:39.559
the seat of the affections and passions as of love, joy, grief, enmity, courage, pleasures,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.920
et cetera. So we find that the scriptures, that's what's being referred to when he speaks

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.160
of the heart. This evening as we look at some Bible truth, I want to preach a message that

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.399
I've titled the heart of the matter. I said to you this morning, it is not something that

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:03.320
I coined as a phrase, but someone wisely said, the heart of the matter is a matter of the

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.920
heart. I tried to look that up to find out exactly who it was that said it and I found

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.799
some conflicting things. I had a Bible college professor that said, if you can't find out

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:17.440
who said it, just claim it that you said it. I don't think that's really good advice and

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.720
so I won't make that claim this evening because someone said it well before I was ever born.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.359
But the reality is that what was said in that statement is so vitally true. You know the

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:35.239
reality is that as we think about that truth in Proverbs 4 and verse number 23, when the

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:42.160
wise man noted, keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life, we each

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.399
would conclude that there are many issues of life. Many things, problems. We spoke this

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:53.920
morning about the fact that our God is greater than any problem that we ever will face. And

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.760
does it matter if that problem is a personal problem or a global problem, our God is greater.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.000
I'm thankful that while all those men were looking at the stature and the size and the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.880
strength of Goliath, that David was almost just not even affected by it. Why? Because

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.480
he was so focused on his God. I know how that we would have that same perspective.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.799
We find that there are many problems in our society. It's not hard for us to identify

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:27.640
problems that we see within our society. The problem is coming to the root of the problem.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.959
The issue that we deal with in our society is how so many problems are going on and so

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:38.720
many issues that are raging in our society and the way in which people want to categorize

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.799
those problems or describe those problems and the solutions that would sought to be

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:51.279
given for those problems, they're avoiding the root of the problem. It's a hard issue.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:57.920
It's a hard issue. And we find that there's a heart problem in our society. You say, Pastor,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.640
how can you so boldly say there's a heart problem in our society? Because Jesus said

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.160
it. Notice again in our text of Scripture here in Matthew 15, I want you to look and

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.519
it's interesting, there are seven items that are mentioned here specifically that Jesus

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:21.040
deals with that these are those things which proceed out of the heart. Notice he says for

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:28.959
out of the heart proceed, number one, evil thoughts. Evil thoughts. We spent some time

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:34.000
not long ago in a message dealing with the truth of Philippians 4.8. What it is that

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.479
we're to think on. And we look at that passage of Scripture and we see the way in which those

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:45.880
thoughts are described and Paul concludes the verse by saying think on these things.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.599
Well here we find that Jesus says that what proceed out of the mouth, the number one thing

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:56.159
he says for out of the heart proceed, I said mouth, excuse me, for out of the heart proceed

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:10.400
evil thoughts. Notice number two, murders. Murders. There's a lot of murder in our world.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:18.880
Yeah? I read recently that in Chicago you're more likely to get shot than you are in Afghanistan.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:28.760
That's sad. That's ridiculous. Amen? Twenty month old was shot yesterday and killed in

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:37.479
Chicago, drive-by shooting. And here's what they said, when is it going to stop? Almost

00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:41.159
every weekend of this year there's been over 100 shootings in Chicago. I know we don't

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:50.520
live in Chicago. But murders? Yeah, we see it. Notice, adulteries. Yeah, it's a heart

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:58.440
issue. It's a heart issue. Fornications. Thefts.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.740
False witness.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.040
Blasphemies.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.840
Blasphemies, often we think about

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.180
the word blasphemy and its relation to God

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.140
and dealing with the fact that we would

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.900
speak of the Lord in terms of impious irreverence.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.080
We find here that this list that is provided

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.440
seven things that the Lord says

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.980
out of the heart proceed.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.580
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.380
fornications, thefts, false witness,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.140
and blasphemies.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.340
In just a little while, we'll go to Galatians

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.740
and notice how the Bible describes

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.480
the works of the flesh.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.680
In that passage of Scripture,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.220
there are 19 things that are mentioned.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.680
The works of the flesh.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.320
See, I want you to consider with me this evening,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
take your Bible, go all the way back

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.180
to the book of Genesis.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.120
I told you we'd go through some things.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.280
And listen, I understand we could spend

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.680
a lot of time looking at a whole lot of things.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.080
But I'm going to try to just go through

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.880
a few references this evening

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.620
to help you to understand that the heart

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.620
of the matter is a matter of the heart.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.980
It's a heart issue.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.720
We're dealing with a society.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.420
Listen, we understand theologically

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.220
that man is not basically good.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.880
Right?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.620
The world wants to say,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.520
oh man, they're basically good.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.080
No.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.779
There's none good.

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:21.720
No, not one.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.920
You say, that's so harsh.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.620
No, it's just Bible.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.120
Amen?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.520
It's just Bible.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.520
There's none good.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.660
No, not one.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.860
Right?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.720
All of your good works, Isaiah said,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.260
it's like filthy rags.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.260
Right?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.459
And we find that, listen,

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:37.660
within the heart of man,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.720
I mean, when we're born,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.560
because of the sin that's recorded

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.459
in Genesis chapter number three,

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.560
sin entered into the world.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.760
We understand that through that sin,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.420
that sin and death has passed to all men,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.720
apart from the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.959
because he's virgin born.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:53.779
Amen?

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:54.760
Someone said, by the way,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.160
something came across my desk this week.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.200
Does the virgin birth of Christ really matter?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.620
Absolutely it matters.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.620
You've got to be kidding me.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.920
From a church that says

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.760
that they're a Baptist church.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.300
Anyway, I'm not preaching on that tonight.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.419
Don't know why it came up.

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:13.119
All right?

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.100
But listen, the reality this evening

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.400
is that when we look at these subject matters

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.320
and we understand, listen,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.800
man is not basically good.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.199
What was going on in the book of Judges?

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.460
Every man did that was right in his own sight.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.300
Right?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.260
In his own eyes.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.800
He became his own authority.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.040
And here's the huge problem

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.339
that we deal with in our society today

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.760
that no one wants to address, by the way,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.160
because we really don't want to deal with the truth.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.600
But what we have done

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.040
is we have systematically removed God

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.300
from our culture.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.500
And as we systematically remove God from our culture,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.160
it really is following the pattern

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.839
of Romans chapter number one.

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:52.339
Right?

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:54.040
We don't want to have God.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.000
We don't want God.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.500
Why?

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.000
Because I don't want to be accountable to God.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And if I remove God,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.479
somehow in my warped idea

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:05.600
that the God of this world, Satan,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.100
has blinded the minds of them that believe not.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.300
They come to this place.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.779
They try to remove God.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:13.380
Look at all of the attack on the record of Genesis.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.740
Creation and the fall of man

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.479
and the flood and all of those things.

00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:20.339
It's attacked, attacked, attacked.

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:20.839
Why?

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:23.240
We're trying to remove God.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.540
And to remove God from society,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.740
somebody or something has to be the authority.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.240
And what happens is I become my own authority.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.940
And we see that in the book of Judges.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.639
In fact, the Bible says it this way

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.139
as the book of Judges is summarized.

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:42.839
In the very last chapter of the book,

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:45.040
in the very last verse,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.339
here in Judges chapter number 21 and verse number 25,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.639
in those days, there was no king in Israel.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:57.940
Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.639
There was no authority.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.540
There was no king.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.339
They did what was right in their own eyes.

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:07.540
See, the reality is that man is not basically good.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.940
He is born a sinner, separated from God.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.440
Amen?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.440
We believe that biblically.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.739
And therefore, we have a situation

00:14:18.739 --> 00:14:23.540
with the sin of mankind that needs to be addressed.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.140
And the only remedy, as we'll get to at the end of our message this evening,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.540
is the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.140
It's the only cure for the problem.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.839
And we find here, all the way back in Genesis chapter number 4,

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.040
I'll ask you some questions.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.839
What was the first murder in human history?

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:41.540
We know.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.540
Cain and Abel, right?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.339
It's here in Genesis chapter number 4.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:47.540
The first murder in human history.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540
What did Jesus say?

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.940
What was it that proceed out of the heart?

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.440
Evil thoughts.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.739
Murders.

00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:54.440
Right?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.040
Now, notice in Genesis chapter number 4,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.540
the Bible tells us in verse number 8,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.040
and Cain talked with Abel as his brother.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.640
His brother.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.839
Amen?

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:07.540
It says this,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.540
and it came to pass when they were in the field,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.839
that Cain rose up against Abel,

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.440
his brother,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.940
and slew him.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.540
Two times in that verse of Scripture the Bible reminds us

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.640
that it's his brother.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.739
Flesh and blood.

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:27.640
Brother.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.140
What was it in Cain?

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.239
It's a heart issue.

00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:34.839
It's a heart issue.

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:40.239
Somehow or another, in his mind, he thought,

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.940
because of the offerings that were brought,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.239
and the way in which his offering was not respected or received,

00:15:47.239 --> 00:15:52.339
he then had anger towards his brother.

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:55.739
God plainly said to Cain,

00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:58.640
Why art thou wroth?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.440
He says,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.940
Why is thy countenance fallen, if thou doest well?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.140
Shalt thou not be accepted?

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.540
You can read it in verse number 7.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.239
What is God saying to him?

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:11.040
If you come the right way,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.239
if you come the prescribed way,

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:16.140
you'll be accepted.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.839
But instead he just got angry.

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:21.739
And because of his heart,

00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:24.040
he killed his brother.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.540
God appears to him and says,

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.640
Where is Abel, thy brother?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.540
Am I my brother's keeper?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.040
Right? Is that what it says?

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.739
Yeah.

00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:39.339
What was the problem with Cain?

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.040
Heart problem.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.239
Heart problem.

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:43.640
It was his brother.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.640
Killed him.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640
Look over, if you will, in Genesis 6.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.440
Let me ask you this.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.440
How did God describe mankind before the flood

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.140
that's recorded here in Genesis 6-8?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.239
Well, God said this,

00:16:57.239 --> 00:17:00.239
in verse number 5 of Genesis 6,

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:04.440
And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.540
that every imagination of the thoughts of his, what?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.239
His heart,

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:13.940
was only evil continually.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.040
It says in verse number 11,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.339
the earth also was corrupt before God,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:24.239
and the earth was filled with violence.

00:17:24.239 --> 00:17:27.739
The Bible doesn't describe for us in complete detail

00:17:27.739 --> 00:17:31.839
every single thing that was happening in these days prior to the flood,

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:36.640
but we understand even as Jesus would reference it in Matthew chapter 25,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.839
we understand that the wickedness upon the earth

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:41.640
and the earth being filled with violence,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.540
that it was at a point in which God brought divine judgment.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.940
But we see that the Bible tells us in verse number 5 that

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.940
every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.440
was only evil continually.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.839
Let me ask you this question as we kind of fast forward here

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:06.140
a number of generations and think about King David.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:12.040
What were the two sins of King David as they're recorded in 2 Samuel chapter 11?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.239
Adultery and murder.

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:16.940
What was the list?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.440
What proceeds out of the heart?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.839
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:29.339
King David was guilty of two of the first three that are mentioned.

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:33.539
By the way, it all started with his look and his thoughts, right?

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:37.239
In fact, it's interesting to note that in 2 Samuel chapter 11,

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:41.440
I've often used this comparison as I think about what's going on here,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.239
and you find that the Bible tells at the very beginning of the passage

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:47.840
that David tarried still at Jerusalem.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.440
It was a time when kings went forth to battle.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.539
David was the king, but he tarried in Jerusalem.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:03.340
And he saw Bathsheba, and he inquired, he asked about her,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.539
and he's told this,

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:12.239
"'Is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?'

00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:16.239
Every time I read verse number 3, in fact, I have in the margin of my Bible,

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:21.739
the response from the servant included the fact that she was a married woman.

00:19:21.739 --> 00:19:25.840
And the reality is that this warning that was given to the king

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.440
was something that he should have taken heed to.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.039
But yet, he did not take heed to the warning.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.440
His immediate response is, "'Bring her to me.'"

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.739
And we understand what happens.

00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:43.239
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:47.140
He commits the transgression of adultery.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.739
He finds that it's resulted in conception.

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:54.239
So what does he do?

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:56.640
We need to try to cover this thing up somehow.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.340
Right?

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.460
Uriah, come back from the battle.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.300
He tries to get Uriah to go home.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.840
Uriah demonstrated more integrity

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.240
in this passage of Scripture

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.020
than most other examples of integrity

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.060
that you'll find throughout the Scriptures.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.680
What a great level of integrity.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.680
David went through a number of iterations

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.200
of trying to get Uriah to go home.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.620
And eventually, David writes a letter

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.400
and hands that letter to Uriah

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.520
that contained his death sentence.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.000
Yeah? Am I telling it right?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.760
Do I need to read it all?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.040
That's it.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.520
Takes it to Joab, right?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.640
What happens?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.240
Joab then sends him to the place

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.560
where he knew he'd die.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.000
And it's interesting when Joab

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.840
is going to tell the servant

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.200
to go back and to let the king know

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.040
how the battle fared,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.280
he told him this at the end of v. 21.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.680
Make sure you tell them,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.080
thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.960
Because the news he was going to bring,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.200
there were other casualties that were involved.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.240
And unless the king would say,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.520
well, didn't you know that this would happen?

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.920
I mean, you went to this place

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.120
and didn't you have this?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.040
He said just make sure you let them know

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.000
that Uriah is dead.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And it's interesting,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.280
when David hears that,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.080
he says this in v. 25,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.160
"'Let not this thing displease Thee,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.800
for the sword devoureth one as well as another.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.960
Make Thy battle more strong against the city

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.520
and overthrow it,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.000
and encourage Thou him.'"

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.200
David had a heart problem.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.120
Amen?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.520
It's interesting to me

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.880
that one of the things that is recorded for us

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.560
in the Psalm of Confession,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.520
turn over to Psalm 51 if you will,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.880
one of the requests that is made

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.520
by David of course in the passage there

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.840
back in 2 Samuel,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.000
we find that it's in chapter 12

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.080
when the Lord sends Nathan unto David.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.160
And Nathan, the prophet, stands before him

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.000
and gives him a parable to start

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.080
and then lets him know,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.560
thou art the man.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.960
I'm thankful that David responded properly.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.360
We read Psalm 51

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.560
and what a great psalm of repentance it is.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.560
We find that he says,

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.760
"'Have mercy upon me.'"

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.560
In verse 1,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.120
"'O God, according to Thy lovingkindness,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.320
according unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.800
blot out my transgressions.'

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.160
Jared sang a song this morning."

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.400
What was the title of that song?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.080
My Confession.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.800
What a beautiful song.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.960
I'd never heard that song before

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.560
until he started practicing it.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.480
I'm so thankful that our God is

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.080
a loving, kind, compassionate God

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.560
who's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.040
He says, "'Wash me throughly

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040
from mine iniquity

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.200
and cleanse me from my sin.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.840
For I acknowledge my transgressions.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.760
My sin is ever before me.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.680
Against Thee, Thee only have I sinned

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.320
and done this evil in Thy sight,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.720
that Thou mightest be justified

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.640
when Thou speakest

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.800
and be clear when Thou judgest.'"

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.120
We don't have time to read the entirety of it,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.160
but I want you to notice a specific request

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.320
that is made by David in this passage of Scripture,

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.800
this psalm of confession.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.160
He says in verse 10,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.600
"'Create in me a clean heart,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.920
create in me a clean heart, O God,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.440
and renew a right spirit within me.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.280
Cast me not away from Thy presence

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.400
and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.600
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.560
and uphold me with Thy free spirit.'"

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.840
If we were preaching an entire message

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.000
on this passage of Scripture,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.040
we'd take each of these phrases apart

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.440
and deal with them.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.880
Suffice it to say this evening

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.320
that he asks the question,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.000
he makes the request,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.280
create in me a clean heart, O God.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.200
It's of interest that he says

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.880
and very important for us to understand

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.040
and as we have the entirety of the Scriptures

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.560
and we have the truth of the New Testament

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.720
and understanding the truth of eternal life,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.720
he says, restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720
He didn't say he needed to be saved again.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.480
He lost his joy.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.560
Everybody loses joy because of sin.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.480
Sin will steal your joy.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.600
It was D.L. Moody that said

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.880
sin will keep you from this book

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.920
or this book will keep you from sin.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.760
The reality is that sin will steal your joy.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.000
And David said, restore unto me

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.240
the joy of my salvation.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.440
But before he says that,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.440
he says, create in me a clean heart, O God.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.960
On at least five occasions,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.640
the exposure of Israel or really Judah in particular

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.240
during the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.720
there's many indictments against Judah

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.200
that are contained within the book of Jeremiah.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.640
On at least five occasions

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.400
in the first several chapters of that great book,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.200
it is said of the people of Judah

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.640
that they had an evil heart.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.160
An evil heart.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.640
And they were doing after the imaginations

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.080
of their evil heart.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.600
If you were to understand and begin to study

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.040
and look at all that was taking place

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.480
during the time of Judah

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.280
on the eve of their captivity,

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.560
and you'd understand the sin and the idolatry

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.640
and the wickedness that they were involved in and engaged in,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.080
you would see why God would indict them

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.000
by telling them that they had an evil heart.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.520
It's interesting as you look at the book of Jeremiah

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.560
again on the eve of captivity,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.080
and you understand what's going on,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.560
and it's interesting if you go

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.280
and you take the truth of Jeremiah

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.760
here in chapter number two of the book,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.120
and you think about what Jesus was dealing with

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.480
with those religious leaders back in Matthew 15.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.320
Remember they were concerned about the washing of the hands,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.800
eating without washing the hands and so on and so forth.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.720
And Jesus is gonna direct them to the issue of their heart.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.240
And he speaks about the prophecy of Isaiah,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.400
which is extremely valid of them saying,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.040
they draw near to me with their lips,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.160
but their heart is far from me.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.080
Listen, God is always concerned about your heart.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.400
He's concerned about the heart.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.680
We find here in the book of Jeremiah in chapter number two,

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.160
and again, we don't have time to read all of it,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.680
but the indictment is given in verse number 11,

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.320
hath a nation changed their gods,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.400
which are yet no gods,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.240
but my people have changed their glory

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.920
for that which it doth not profit.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.920
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.360
and be horribly afraid.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.000
Be very desolate, saith the Lord,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.800
for my people have committed two evils.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.560
They have forsaken me for the fountain of living waters

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.120
and hewed them out cisterns,

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.000
broken cisterns that can hold no water.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.360
In verse 17, hast thou not procured this unto thyself

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.160
in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.440
when He led thee by the way?

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.720
Notice verse 19, thine own wickedness shall correct thee

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.840
and thy backsliding shall reprove thee.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.280
Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.360
and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.000
and that my fear is not in thee,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.320
saith the Lord God of hosts.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.000
Skip down and look at verse 22.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.400
For though thou wash thee with niter

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.000
and take thee much soap,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.520
yet thine iniquity is marked before me,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.720
saith the Lord God.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.760
They couldn't just wash up and clean up

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.160
and look, no, no, they had a heart issue.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.280
And there was nothing that could be done on the outward

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.520
that was gonna clean it up and fix it.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.920
We understand from 1 Samuel 16, right?

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.080
Remember when Samuel goes,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.640
he's gonna anoint the next king.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.840
He'd been given the direction of the Lord

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.760
and God had told Samuel,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.840
you go to the house of Jesse

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.520
and you're gonna anoint the next king, right?

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.680
Eliab is the first one that stands before him.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.280
Surely this is he.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.000
Is that not Samuel's response, right?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.800
But God says, nope, not him.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.840
Number two, number three, number four,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.560
number five, number six.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.440
Jesse is there.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.840
Samuel says, are these all your sons?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.320
Well, there's another one.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.480
He's out in the field.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.840
They didn't even bring him.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.080
What'd he say?

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.240
Send for him.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.000
They didn't sit down until he came.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.040
You find that there in 1 Samuel 16,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.840
that as soon as David is coming,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.040
that God lets Samuel know,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.880
that's the one.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.360
That's the one.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.160
He's the one that you're to anoint

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.400
and he pours oil on him.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400
He anoints him.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.000
It's interesting that within the text of Scripture,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.840
right after he saw Eliab,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.480
he looked on him and he said,

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.000
surely the Lord's anointed is before him.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.400
But God showed Samuel a great lesson

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.840
and recorded it for us in His Word.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.800
The Lord said unto Samuel in verse seven of 1 Samuel 16,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.320
look not on his countenance

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.680
or on the height of his stature.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.520
Why?

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.360
Because I have refused him.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.680
For the Lord seeth not as man seeth.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.360
For man looketh on the outward appearance,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.800
but the Lord looketh on the heart.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.880
There are two truths that we can take

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.120
from this passage of Scripture.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.600
Number one, man can only see the outward,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.840
so the outward is important.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.880
We don't discount and just dismiss the outward

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.559
because when God sees the heart.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:29.280
No, all other man can see is the outward, right?

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.520
So the outward's important.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.720
But we understand that we don't make those decisions

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.559
that God makes because God looketh on the heart.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.320
He says, you can try to clean it all up.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.160
What are you talking about?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.160
Jesus talked about the whited sepulchers, right?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.000
Who are they?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.760
They're filled with dead men's bones.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.720
They look good on the outside, cleaned up.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.120
Bunch of dead men's bones in there, right?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.400
And so we find that as we look at the truth

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.040
of the Word of God and we see this.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.360
various examples in the Old Testament

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.800
of this heart issue.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800
And we find that the works of the flesh,

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.880
as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.120
go over to Galatians 5, if you will.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.280
And as you look in Galatians 5,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.240
I want you to consider

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.200
these 19 things that are given to us

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.720
as the works of the flesh.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.880
Now it's interesting, as we begin to see

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.520
that the Bible says the works of the flesh are manifest.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.160
Here's how they are manifest.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.840
Here's how they're known, right?

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.080
He goes through this list and he reveals it to us.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.720
He says, these are the works of the flesh.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.680
This is the natural man.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.120
This is the wicked heart.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.960
Remember what Paul said.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.840
We studied through the book of Ephesians last year.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.400
We went through the entire book in our morning services

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.920
and we preached and had the theme, be strong in the Lord.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.360
Remember that Paul made this statement

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.480
in Ephesians chapter number two.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.360
Stay there in Galatians.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.680
But he said, where in time past

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.120
you walked according to the course of this world,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.200
according to the prince of the power of the air,

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.440
the spirit that outworketh

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.720
and the children of disobedience,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.720
among whom also we all had our conversation in time past

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.160
in the lust of our flesh,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.760
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.560
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.360
Praise God for verse number four,

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.520
but God who is rich in mercy.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.200
We don't have time to deal with all of Ephesians

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.040
chapter number two,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.720
but you see the desires of the flesh, right?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.320
Here we see the works of the flesh

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.960
as they're described to us in Galatians chapter number five.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.360
I believe that this list that is provided to us

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.200
further proves the evil and wicked behavior of mankind

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.880
is a heart problem.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.000
Paul starts out in verse number 16 by saying,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
this I say then, walk in the spirit

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.400
and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.720
We're gonna come back to that thought here

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.920
in just a few moments.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.080
Notice it says the flesh lusteth against the spirit,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.440
the spirit against the flesh,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.480
and these are contrary the one to the other

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.880
so that you cannot do the things that you would.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.400
But if you be led of the spirit, you're not under the law.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.760
Now understand, before we get into verse number 19,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.680
understand a very important truth

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.360
as we get into this passage.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.320
The book of Galatians is written to whom?

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.260
It's written to the churches in the region of Galatia.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.080
There were four churches that were planted

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.760
during the first missionary journey of the apostle Paul.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.520
He left the church in Antioch.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.560
He was sent out, first went to Antioch and Pisidia,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.240
then he went to Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.360
And in those cities, churches were established.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.440
He's now writing back to those churches.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.280
Why?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.080
Because there were some proselytes that came in,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.200
there was all kinds of things going on,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.920
excuse me, Judaizers that came in,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.280
and these Judaizers, all the things that were going on,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.040
legalism, so on and so forth,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.960
and we find that here that the apostle Paul

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.000
is writing to these believers, right, these churches.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.760
The church is, a church is made up of saved membership,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.080
right, we believe that in order to be a member

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.120
of a local church that you have to be saved and baptized.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.320
And so we find here that he says,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.640
"'Walk in the Spirit, you shall not

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.600
"'fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.280
"'The flesh lusteth against the Spirit.'"

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.260
For us this evening as saved people,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.700
have we experienced this?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.440
Have you experienced your flesh and your spirit

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.480
being enmity one against the other?

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.120
Have you experienced the way that Paul described it

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120
in Romans when he said,

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.360
the things that I would, I do not,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.840
the things that I would not, that I do,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.240
that's the flesh and the spirit

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.000
contrary one to the other.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.040
Have you experienced it?

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.160
Guess what?

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.560
If you're lost, you don't have the Spirit of God

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.260
living within you and you don't have that enmity.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.400
Amen?

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.360
Amen.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.400
The reality is that Ephesians 1

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.920
shares with us the plan of redemption

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.720
that before the foundation of the world,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.200
God had a plan to redeem fallen mankind.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.320
He shares with us what the price would be

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.220
for that redemption.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.520
It's the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.180
And he tells us what the proof of our redemption is.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.000
It's the Holy Spirit of God.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.280
Amen?

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.680
We find that the Bible tells us

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.700
that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost,

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.700
which is in you.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.020
What you have of God.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:13.860
You're not your own.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.140
You're bought with the price.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.940
And the reality is that I have no Holy Spirit

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.800
until I get saved.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.380
At the moment of conversion,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.740
immediately, I didn't understand all of this

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.860
when I got saved 20 some years ago.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.580
But at the moment of salvation,

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.320
the Holy Spirit of God indwelled me.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.600
If you're saved this evening,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.500
the Holy Spirit of God indwelled you.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.380
And you have all the Holy Spirit you're ever going to get.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.660
He doesn't have all of us,

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.600
but we have all of Him.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.420
That's why Paul would say in there,

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.460
in the book of Ephesians,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.000
to be filled with the Spirit.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.060
The idea of that continual filling.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:52.900
Why?

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.620
Because we get filled up of ourselves,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.580
and we get filled up, right?

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.000
But we need to be filled with the Spirit.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.940
We have all of Him when we're indwelled by Him.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.860
That's the proof of our redemption.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.260
But as we look at Galatians 5,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.380
we have to understand something this evening

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.400
that as we look at this

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.060
and we understand these works of the flesh,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.820
and we understand how they're going to be manifest

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.820
in the list that God's gonna give us here,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.660
that the lost person, the unregenerate person,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.060
they don't have the Spirit of God convicting them.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.800
They don't have that enmity.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.460
They just have a heart of unregenerate heart

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.760
that Ephesians chapter number two says

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.260
that they're going to simply fulfill

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.580
the lust and the desires of their flesh.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.420
Why?

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.240
Because they're lost.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.860
They're lost.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.780
Galatians 5, look at the works of the flesh.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.020
Verse number 19, it begins,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.460
now the works of the flesh are manifest.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.800
Which are these?

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.760
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.980
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.180
hatred, variance, emulations,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.100
wrath, strife, seditions, heresies.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.460
Verse 21, envyings, murders,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.940
drunkenness, revelings, and such like.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.220
Of the witch I tell you before

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.340
as I have also told you in time past

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.780
that they which do such things

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.860
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.560
Verse 22 starts with a conjunction,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.900
but the fruit of the Spirit.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.700
Oh, what a lovely list it is.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.540
Amen?

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.460
The fruit of the Spirit, love, joy,

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.780
peace, longsuffering, gentleness,

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.940
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.060
Against such there is no law, right?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.580
So we see the works of the flesh manifest.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.220
I believe, again, as I mentioned,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.860
that this list further proves

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.300
that the evil and wicked behavior of mankind

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.780
is a heart problem.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.100
It was a heart problem in Genesis chapter number four.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.180
It was a heart problem in Genesis chapter number six.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.900
It was a heart problem in 2 Samuel chapter number 11.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.740
It was a heart problem throughout the book of Judges.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.340
A heart problem, I mean, we could go on

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.260
all sorts of illustrations this evening

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.220
of what we find is a heart problem

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.340
when Jesus was dealing with the religious leaders.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.340
They were lost.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.860
They had a hard heart.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.140
They had a heart problem.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.420
If we're not careful, even as believers,

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.820
we can have a heart problem.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:24.860
And we understand that,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.080
really kind of a situation we deal with in another context,

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.280
but this evening, as we think about these things

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.560
that have been given to us, I ask this question,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.280
then what is the remedy?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.000
There's only one remedy for the heart problem of mankind.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.440
And that remedy is redemption

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.160
through the blood of Jesus Christ.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.020
Transformation, not reformation.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.920
Amen?

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.580
We're not trying to go through some kind of step process

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.200
of whatever and clean the man up.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.080
No, we wanna have the truth of the gospel,

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.080
which is the power of God unto salvation.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.440
And Paul declares, you think about the Apostle Paul

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.360
in Acts chapter nine, when he's still referred to as Saul,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.320
before his conversion, he's got letters of authority

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.520
in his hands to go and to take any of that way,

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.720
which refers to those that would be believers,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.480
followers of Jesus Christ, come to be called Christians

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.960
by the church in Antioch,

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.280
and we find that he has the authority, he has the letters,

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.720
he's done various things.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.000
He's been consulting unto the death of many people,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.440
taking them and all of these things.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.120
He had a, I mean, people knew about him.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.920
And then he's preaching Christ

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.880
by the end of the chapter.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.720
What happened?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.600
Here's what he declares in 2 Corinthians five,

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.360
if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.480
Old things are passed away,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.240
behold, all things are become new.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.080
You know what we need?

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.080
We need people to go out and preach the gospel.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.000
It's amazing to me that the church,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.800
you know, the church, Paul says this,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.240
that the church is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.080
Right?

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.280
We have the truth of God's word.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.440
And we have the responsibility to take the truth

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.680
of the word of God and deliver that message

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.480
to a lost and dying world.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.040
And we see all of these things.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.320
We see the works of the flesh.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.360
We see the heart of mankind being revealed to us

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.840
through all of the things that are going on in our society.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.240
And we say, have people sitting around

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.680
and trying to figure out what is it that we can do?

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.560
How can we come up with new programs?

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.880
What new thing can we do?

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.560
What millions of dollars can we spend over here?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.040
How can we do this?

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.640
Preach the book.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.400
But guess what?

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.880
They removed the book.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.080
As a society, we made decisions

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.680
in the Supreme Court.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.760
Can't have prayer, Bible, in school.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.520
Some of you grew up in school when you read the Bible.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.160
in school. I didn't grow up at that era, but some of you remember being in school,

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:12.400
public school, reading the Bible. No, we want to remove God. You can't speak about

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:21.840
God. You can't. And then we got what we have today, right? If you read Romans 1,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.120
you'll see it's the, I mean, it's just the devil has no new tricks, okay? That's just

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:33.840
the situation we're dealing with today really is laid out for us in Romans 1, and we see

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.480
that. But let me talk about the remedy. Let me read a few passages of scripture to you.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:43.560
Romans 6. Romans 6, and I need to hurry. I just got a few passages to read to you. Romans

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:54.360
6. Begin looking at verse number, let's read verse 17. Verse 16, let's read there first.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.400
Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.920
whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. But God be

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:12.560
thanked that ye were the servants of sin. Speaking about past tense, right? This is

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.560
what you were. You were the servants of sin. We all can identify there, right? What did

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.200
Paul say in Philippians chapter number two? Excuse me, Ephesians chapter number two. We

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.880
all had our conversation there. We all were lost. We're all in the same boat, right? But

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.120
thank God that he's rich in mercy. And we heard the gospel, we responded to the gospel,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.120
and we trusted Christ our Savior. He says, but God be thanked that ye were the servants

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.440
of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:53.360
you being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. See, sometimes

00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:00.680
we get mad at a sinner because they sin. But we have to recognize this if we read the entirety

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:08.200
here of Romans chapter number six, the reality that they are bound by their sin. Amen? They

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:13.440
are bound by their sin. I am thankful that I have been set free. You notice it says in

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.360
verse number 14, for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.440
under grace. Listen, we've often said that at the moment of salvation that we are delivered

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:31.080
from the penalty of sin. What's the penalty of sin? Death. Amen? The wage of sin is death.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.840
I'm thankful to be delivered from the penalty of sin, that second death, right? He says

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.200
this with regard to death and hell were cast in the lake of fire. This is the second death

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.080
in Revelation chapter 20. I've been delivered from that. I've been delivered from the power

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.240
of sin. Does it mean that we don't sin? No. But we should sin a whole lot less. I'm not

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.160
bound by sin anymore. I've been delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit of God that

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.520
lives within me, who gives me the opportunity to have victory that allows me to walk in

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.720
the Spirit so that I do not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Amen? I didn't have that when

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:15.440
I was lost. But I'm not yet delivered from the presence of sin. One day I'll be in heaven

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:21.360
and so will you. There'll be no more sin. Won't it be wonderful? But we find that here

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:31.480
are some that are still the servants of sin. And guess what? As a servant of sin with a

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:40.800
heart that is unregenerate, what proceeds out of that heart? We read it in Matthew 15.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.720
Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, right? You read it. The works of the flesh

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.600
are these, right? The works of the flesh are manifest, and here's what they are. So if

00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:00.600
you're a servant of sin, if you're unregenerate, that's the behavior that you're going to expect.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:06.160
But those that have believed from the heart, that have obeyed from the heart that form

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.680
of the doctrine which was delivered to you, what's that? The Gospel, right? What did Paul

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.040
say in the very beginning of this letter? I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.920
It was the power of God unto salvation, right? He said that he was ready to preach. He was

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.240
a debtor. And we understand that as he's speaking here, he says, you believe the Gospel, therefore

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.640
you were a servant of sin, but now you're a servant of righteousness. Isn't that wonderful

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.120
to be a servant of righteousness? No longer to have to be a servant of sin. To have that

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:40.240
chain and ball of sin attached to us and we can't help but just do this. No. But thanks

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:46.920
be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Now we can be a servant

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.400
of righteousness, not a servant of sin. 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, turn over there.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.600
Who's Paul writing to? He's writing to some saved people, the church in Corinth. Oh, there's

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.360
some carnal people, but there's some saved people. Amen? The reality is that he writes

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.040
here in 1 Corinthians and as he's writing these people, I mean, there's divisions and

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.160
all sorts of things going on and what have you, but we find that he's writing to them.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.920
Notice in verse number 9 in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6, know ye not that the unrighteous

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.000
shall not inherit the kingdom of God, be not deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.200
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.360
covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:36.360
God. And such were some of you. But, aren't you so thankful for that little conjunction?

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:43.520
But, ye are washed. We sing the song, Are You Washed? In the blood. In the soul-cleansing

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.680
blood of the Lamb. When we sing that song in the chorus, when it says, Are You Washed?

00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:01.680
I like to say, Yes I am. Amen? I don't know how to sing another part and do the harmony

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:08.800
and all that stuff, but man, I like to say, Yes I am. It's a question, Are You Washed?

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:16.160
Paul says, Ye are washed. But, you're sanctified. But, you're justified. In the name of the

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:23.480
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Oh, thank God for redemption. How he changed

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:31.480
our lives. We can testify this evening that I'm not the man I used to be. My perfect

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:42.320
no. I'm so thankful for 1 John 2, that I have an advocate with the Father. Jesus Christ

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:50.160
the Righteous. Amen? What a blessing. Here in Galatians 5, we end here. We were here

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:56.400
earlier looking at the works of the flesh, but notice he says in verse 16, But this I

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:03.400
say. This I say then, walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:11.080
The only person that can obey the instruction of verse 16 is a saved person. I cannot stand

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:19.080
up and preach a message to a lost crowd. If I receive an invitation, there are times in

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:28.160
which I've preached in settings where I have believed that apart from me and my wife on

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:34.520
one occasion, there were one other person here that I knew of, there were 3 saved people.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.740
There was another occasion that I preached, and as far as I was aware, I was the only

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:44.540
saved person there. Holly wasn't there. I was by myself. As far as I knew, I was the

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:50.180
only saved person. I would never in that setting open up Galatians 5 and verse 16 and say,

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:57.180
walk in the Spirit. They can't. What's the message I need to deliver them? Ye must be

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:04.180
born again. Right? Ye must be born again. Is that what Jesus said to Nicodemus? Jesus

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:10.700
didn't say to Nicodemus, walk in the Spirit. Jesus didn't tell Nicodemus to do that. No.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:17.700
He said, ye must be born again. When Paul went on his missionary journeys, did he preach

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:26.420
walk in the Spirit? No, he preached the Gospel. Then, after they were saved, he taught them

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:32.100
how to walk. Read the book of Ephesians, the first 3 chapters. He deals with their conversion,

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.940
their position in Christ. Then, beginning in chapter 4, 5 and 6, he talks about their

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:41.820
walk. Now that you're saved, here's how you walk. You don't tell a lost person how to

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:47.660
clean up their life and how to walk. They can't serve God. They're lost. So, what's

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:54.660
the problem in our society? A lot of lost people. It's always been that way, though.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:02.460
What's the solution? Go buy a ranch somewhere in Idaho and hide under the hills? No. Preach

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:09.460
the Gospel. Amen? It's the power of God unto salvation. Did it work for you? It worked

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:20.420
for me. It worked for my dad. I only use that example because I was almost 13 years old

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:27.420
when he got saved. Guess what? As a 13 year old, you know when something happens. Amen?

00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:33.260
I don't need to go into all the details. What I'm saying is that the Gospel worked in that

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:40.260
man's life. I saw it. I didn't understand it. I understand it a whole lot more today

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:48.340
than I did then. It worked in my life. It worked in your life. Why wouldn't we think

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:55.780
it would work in somebody else's life? It is the power of God unto salvation. That word

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.540
power is a nice word. It's a word that we get our word dynamite.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.980
dynamite for, right?

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.460
The Greek word is the same Greek word that we get our word dynamite from.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.460
Dynamite's pretty powerful.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.460
Amen?

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.460
You want to blow something up, Dean?

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.460
Blow something up?

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.340
He's always talking about guns and bullets and all that kind of stuff.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.300
Get some dynamite, amen?

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.300
Blow something up.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.300
You understand what I'm saying, though?

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.900
Listen, we have the answer.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.900
We have the remedy.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.660
We have the cure.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.100
And we run around and we look at all these things that are going on in our society, and

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.500
we're listening to all of these talking heads say all of the things that they're saying

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:44.260
on how they're going to fix this and fix that and do this and do that, and we need more

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.900
of this, and we need the gospel.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:53.260
We're never going to clean up society apart from man being converted.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.060
Why?

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.020
Because the heart of the matter is a matter of the heart.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.700
We've got a heart problem.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.700
And the only thing...

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:10.140
See, God made this promise in Ezekiel, really to the Jews, to Israel, that He would create

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:15.320
in them a clean heart, a new heart, a fleshly heart.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320
He will do that.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.580
But see, the Jews, Israel rejected Jesus as Messiah.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.300
They were set aside.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.540
The Gentiles were grafted in.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.540
And guess what?

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.660
Now, because of the beauty of salvation, when we get saved, we get that clean heart.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.460
We get that new heart.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:37.500
What a beautiful thing.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.700
A servant of righteousness or a servant of sin?

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.460
Walk in the Spirit?

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.240
I can't expect a lost person to do that.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.620
I need to give them the gospel.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:54.660
This evening, I hope that we would be motivated to understand that it's a heart problem and

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.700
that as believers, we have the answer.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.380
We just need to go and take the gospel.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.300
I understand it's not the most popular thing.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.300
People aren't ready to receive it.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.580
I understand that.

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.860
But I don't think there's probably ever been a time in human history that they were ready

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.100
to receive it.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.100
You know why?

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.100
It's a spiritual battle.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.660
Brother, you're going to Uganda.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.380
People ask missionaries all the time this question.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.540
I've never been a missionary, but I've heard a lot of missionaries get asked questions.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.220
Are the people in the field that you're going to receptive to the gospel?

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:32.180
I've heard that question I don't know how many times.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.380
You'll receive that question, no doubt.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.420
Are they receptive?

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.160
The reality is that the gospel's confrontational.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.860
We can use a subjective scale to determine the openness and the receptivity of a certain

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.620
group of people versus another group of people and so on and so forth, and we can deal with

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.620
that.

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:57.700
But the reality at the end of the day is that the gospel is confrontational, and we must

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.080
be willing to confront somebody with their need for Christ.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.220
I hope this evening that each and every person that's here knows the Lord Jesus Christ as

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:14.800
their personal Savior, that you've been born again, that you no longer are under the penalty

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.360
of sin.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.320
You've understood that Jesus is the only Savior.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.920
We sing the song with the kids, one way God said to get to heaven, Jesus is the only way.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.640
No other way, no other way.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.880
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, for by grace we are saved through faith,

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.360
not of works as any man should boast, right?

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.360
Thank God for his mercy and his grace.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.400
If you're not saved this evening, let me take a Bible and show you how you can know for

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.020
sure that heaven's your home.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.500
If you know the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior tonight, I hope that we would be able

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:56.420
to walk away saying, there's a heart problem in our society, in our world, and the only

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:02.100
cure is Jesus, the only cure is Jesus.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.380
And we have been allowed of God, to use the words of Paul, that he says to the church

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.340
in Thessalonica, we have been allowed of God to preach the gospel.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.420
And what a unique privilege that is.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.660
Don't misunderstand it, you have a responsibility as well.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:23.180
Because Jesus said, go and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:27.260
We've been given a unique privilege.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.740
We've been given a responsibility.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.180
We have the answer, and the answer is Jesus.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.180
Let's pray.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.180
Father, we love you this evening.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.100
We thank you for loving us.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.420
Thank you for the Word of God.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:46.740
This evening, as we've surveyed through many portions of Scripture, bounced back and forth,

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:54.620
I trust that there's been a level of continuity that's helped us to acknowledge this evening

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:59.060
there's a heart problem.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:05.900
The only way to address that problem is with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.060
God if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, I pray that you would help them tonight

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:14.700
Lord, to understand their need for Christ.

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:20.740
They would not leave without knowing for sure, that if they were to die, that they'd go to heaven.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:26.140
Lord, I pray that every believer would be challenged this evening to understand that

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:33.500
the greatest cause that we can be engaged in is the cause of preaching the gospel of

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.500
Jesus Christ.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.580
It's the only hope for mankind.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:44.380
God, I pray that we would be faithful, that we would acknowledge as the Apostle Paul did

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:50.220
as he's writing to the church there in Rome, the believers in Rome, that he was debtor,

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.500
he was ready, he was not ashamed.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.380
Help us Lord, I pray.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.980
Have your will and way in this moment of invitation.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.100
Help us to respond.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.140
Help us God to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.140
We'll thank you for it.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.140
In Christ's name we pray.

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.140
Amen.
