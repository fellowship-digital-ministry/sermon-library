00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
One, of course, we're going through the Book of Colossians this year,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.360
and our theme, Complete in Christ. I'm so thankful

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.720
for the Word of God. I'm so thankful for our position

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.600
in Christ. If you have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.000
what a joy to be a child of the King. What a joy to know Him

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.479
and to be in Christ and know that He dwells within you.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.600
And what great truth in the Word of God. We, of course,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.040
had our introductory lesson to the Book of Colossians.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.279
We looked at the first eight verses of Colossians chapter number one,

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:39.840
and this morning, before we get into verses 9 through 14, we're going to back

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.759
up and look at verse number three and deal with a subject matter that is of

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:49.040
significant importance. And the first few verses of this book,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.680
the book that we refer to as the Book of Colossians,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.599
we find that the Apostle Paul will make a statement that, if we're not careful,

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:58.560
is a statement that is easy for us to pass over.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.400
But I believe that it's of great importance, and I believe that not only

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.839
is it of great importance, but the statement would have brought

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:10.080
a great level of encouragement to the recipients of this book.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.720
I want you to notice in verse number three, the Bible says,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.120
we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.879
Notice these four words, praying always for you.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:27.680
Praying always for you. If you're taking notes, that's the title

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.919
for the message this evening. What a precious statement this is. Now,

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.800
remember, as we had our introduction to the Book of Colossians,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.680
we've made note that Paul, the Apostle Paul, the human penman of this book,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.839
he did not know the believers in Colossae personally.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:48.480
He had received report from Epaphras with regard to this group of

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.760
believers in Colossae and this church that had been established,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.040
but he himself had not met them and ministered amongst them personally.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.599
Yet, we find that as we study the Book of Colossians, that the Apostle Paul

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.160
had a great heart for these individuals. He longed to meet them,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.919
he loved them in the faith, and he's praying for them.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.440
Now, I want you to consider that just for a moment, because the reality

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.679
is that we might, as we would think about our relationship one with another

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:22.960
as a body of believers, as a local church, we understand the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.839
importance of praying one for another. And there may be some folks that we pray

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.520
for that we do not know personally. Maybe we hear about a missionary that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.759
sends a report, and maybe we pray for someone, and you

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.240
may not have the opportunity to be able to communicate directly with them

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.080
to tell them that you're praying for them. But can you imagine

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.199
if you had that opportunity, the sense of encouragement that they would receive

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.639
by understanding that someone else is holding the ropes? I mean, consider

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.520
with me this morning the encouragement that we receive

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.520
when a brother and sister in Christ, when someone that we know,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.880
that we fellowship along with, that they tell us, hey, I'm praying for you.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.839
What a great privilege. The privilege of prayer is a unique privilege for the

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:16.399
child of God. We believe this morning that prayer

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:22.880
is not just some rote religious exercise. We believe this morning that prayer is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.240
literally entering into the throne room of heaven,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.320
that we have an intercessor, that we have a mediator,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.800
that we can go to the throne of grace, and that we can receive

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.399
help in time of need, that we can pray one for another. In fact, we are

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.240
instructed to pray one for another. And as we

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.639
look at these few words, these four simple words

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.360
in Colossians 1 and verse number 3, we would find

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.039
the subject matter of intercessory prayer.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.320
We speak about prayer and we understand the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.960
prayer promises. Maybe even on Wednesday evening when I sent out the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.639
prayer bulletin, I included a number of verses of Scripture this week

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.479
in my email that I sent out. What a great privilege it is as a child of God

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.279
to go before the throne room of heaven, to

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:20.640
understand that God Almighty, the sovereign God of the universe, that He

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.279
has extended an invitation that we would call upon Him,

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.640
that He has promised that He would hear us, and that He is

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.760
able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. Begin to

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.519
zero in specifically on the subject matter before us this morning,

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:43.279
and think about the subject matter of intercessory prayer.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.480
We would find that intercessory prayer is the

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.679
area of prayer, if I could use that terminology, when I

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:53.600
seek the face of Almighty God on the behalf

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.119
of others. That I'm no longer just going to prayer for my own

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.320
needs, for my own circumstances, for my own

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.200
situation, but I am entering into prayer. I am

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.720
going and seeking the face of Almighty God

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.320
on the behalf of others. Notice what the Scriptures say as Paul

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.760
is speaking here. We find in verse number one that it says,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.600
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.600
and Timotheus, our brother. Notice, to the saints and faithful brethren in

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.600
Christ, which are at Colossae, grace be unto you and peace from God

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.320
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. So in verses one and two, we find that he

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.119
establishes the authorship of the book and the

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.640
recipients of the book. He establishes that he is the human

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.519
penman for the book of Colossians. We understand

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:53.760
theologically, biblically, doctrinally, that all Scripture is given by

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.920
inspiration of God, but God did use human beings, and Paul

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.200
is the human penman of this book. And so that's established in verse

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.480
number one. In verse number two, the recipients is

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.320
established to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, which

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.279
are at Colossae. So now when we come to verse number three,

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.600
he says, we give thanks. Who's we? Well, according to verse number one, it

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.399
would be Paul and Timotheus. We give thanks to God and the Father of

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.799
our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:29.359
for you. So who's praying? Paul and Timotheus,

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:33.359
and they're praying for who? To the saints, to the faithful brethren

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:37.679
in Christ, which are at Colossae. And thus we understand the subject of

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:41.359
intercessory prayer, as we would consider this morning the

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.239
subject matter of intercessory prayer. If you're taking notes, I want you to

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:46.799
consider, first of all, with me the example

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.799
of intercessory prayer. The Bible is full of examples

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:54.720
of intercessory prayer. We're going to kind of walk through the Scriptures this

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.359
morning using Colossians 1 and verse number 3 as

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:01.200
our springboard. I want you to go back to the book of Romans, if you will,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.519
and look in Romans in chapter number one. And as the Apostle Paul is addressing

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.760
these believers in Rome, we find that he again would give them this encouraging

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.079
word with regard to the subject of

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:18.160
intercessory prayer. As we look at these first set of verses,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.600
we will understand, when we consider the example of

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.559
intercessory prayer, we'll understand how Paul

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:30.079
is praying for others. Notice in verse number nine of Romans 1,

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.839
the Bible says, well, let's look at verse number eight. First, I thank my God

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:37.200
through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.839
spoken of throughout the whole world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:48.000
my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.720
I make mention of you always in my prayers.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.600
Now, if you were one of these believers in Rome and you receive this letter

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.000
that the Apostle Paul has sent, the word of God, as we understand that

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.519
this book is inspired, and you receive this

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:10.399
letter and you receive this word, and Paul says that without

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:16.640
ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers. Paul's praying for

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.760
these believers in Rome. Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.119
Ephesians chapter number one. And I want you to note,

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:26.480
really, there's a couple of passages in the book of Ephesians that we could look

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.720
to. There are a couple of specific prayers

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.400
that are outlined here in the book of Ephesians as Paul is praying for these

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.760
believers. But note with me in Ephesians 1, in

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.119
verse number 15, the Bible says this, wherefore I also, after I heard of your

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:46.320
faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints, cease

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.000
not to give thanks for you, making mention of you

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.320
in my prayers. So we find that in the book of Romans he says that without

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.840
ceasing, and here in the book of Ephesians he says that he

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.880
says, I cease not to give thanks for you all.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.400
We understand that verse 16 does not include the I, but as we look at verse

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.960
number 15, we would understand that it's Paul that's

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.840
speaking, and in essence we could say that he's saying,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.239
I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:18.880
in my prayers. He goes on here in Ephesians 1

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.400
to tell them how he's praying for them. That will be the subject of our next

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.239
study in the book of Colossians as we enter into verses 9 and following

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:29.440
in Colossians chapter number 1. We're going to look at Paul saying to these

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.039
believers in Colossae that he's praying always for them, but

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.919
then he says, here's how I'm praying for you.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:40.159
How encouraging that is. Look over if you look in the book of Philippians, turn

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:44.320
over a few pages in Philippians chapter number 1.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.799
In Philippians chapter number 1, in verse number 3, the Bible says this, I

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:52.559
thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:57.039
always in every prayer of mine for you all,

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:01.919
making request with joy.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:07.759
Again, in the very first few verses of the book of Philippians, for these believers in

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:12.839
Philippi to understand that Paul is praying for them.

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:17.839
And he's letting them know that this is not just a situation where, hey, I'm going to

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:21.559
be seeing you in a little while, so I'm going to let you know that I'm praying for you,

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:28.279
so that you have…no, he's faithfully engaged in the work of intercessory prayer.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:32.119
And he's letting people know, the example is all throughout the Scriptures.

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:33.119
First Thessalonians.

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:37.719
We'll look at a few more verses here in First Thessalonians chapter number 1.

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:43.599
You note here that he says in verse number 1, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:49.239
church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:54.519
Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:11:02.919
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:07.199
He says to these same believers in the next book that he writes, Second Thessalonians,

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:11.599
if you want to jot it down, in chapter number 1 and verse number 11, he says, wherefore

00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:17.879
also we pray always for you.

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:19.559
The book of Second Timothy.

00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:24.759
Now, the book of Second Timothy is written not to a church, not to a group of believers

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:29.399
as these other books that we've read, that we've referenced up to this point, but we

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:34.079
understand the book of Second Timothy, First and Second Timothy, are written specifically

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:37.519
to Timothy, Paul's son in the faith.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:42.279
And Paul will say to Timothy here in Second Timothy chapter number 1, notice again in

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:47.079
verse 1 and 2, the author, the recipient to Timothy, it says in verse number 2, but notice

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:52.239
in verse number 3, I thank God whom I serve for my forefathers with pure conscience that

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:56.479
without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers.

00:11:56.479 --> 00:12:00.399
Notice what he says, night and day.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:05.039
Now, we begin to understand as we've looked at these verses of Scripture this morning

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:10.639
and we find the example of intercessory prayer and we find that Paul is saying, without ceasing

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.679
I make mention of you always in my prayers.

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:18.359
He says, always in every prayer of mine, he says that here he says that he's praying

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:21.399
for them night and day.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:28.039
What an example that we have in the Word of God of the importance of intercessory prayer.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:33.359
We find that in the book of Philemon, again, a book that is written to an individual, not

00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:40.639
to a church, but we find that here as Paul would be writing to this individual with the

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:43.679
name of Philemon, he tells him, I thank my God.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:48.319
In Philemon, there's only one chapter, verse number 4, I thank my God making mention of

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:52.279
thee always in my prayers.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:57.379
So we find as we begin to consider the example of intercessory prayer, we find that the Apostle

00:12:57.379 --> 00:13:03.719
Paul is one that we can look to regularly and find how that he is communicating with

00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:08.079
other people, other believers, I am praying for you.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:12.679
On many occasions throughout the Scriptures, we did not take time to look at the entirety

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:17.239
of it, but on many of these occasions, he not only says I'm praying for you, but he

00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:20.879
tells them how he's praying for them.

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:26.799
And when I understand as I read the Scriptures and I read the recorded prayers that God gives

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:32.239
us in his precious Word, when I read the prayers of the Apostle Paul, his intercessory prayers

00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:40.639
for these individuals, I find that it goes far beyond, Lord, would you bless them, amen?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.239
It's specific.

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:48.319
I would say this, if we're going to understand the importance and we see the example of intercessory

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:53.039
prayer, that we would understand that Paul is communicating with others, I'm praying

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:56.999
for you, and here's how I'm praying for you.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:14:03.239
Not only does Paul say that I'm praying for you and give the example, but we find that

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:09.119
Paul then also requests that others would pray for him.

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:12.999
And this is interesting as we study the Word of God and we understand that Paul is saying,

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:17.919
hey, I am praying for you, and here's how I'm praying for you, but then Paul says, would

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:21.039
you pray for me?

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:27.879
I am involved, I am engaged in intercessory prayer on your behalf, but I want you to be

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:30.919
engaged in intercessory prayer on my behalf.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:37.599
It is a privilege that we have as the people of God, as the children of God, and Paul says,

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.799
as we go back, go back to the book of Romans, if you will, we're going to march right through

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.279
the Scriptures again.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:46.599
We mentioned already that in Romans chapter number 1, he tells those believers that he's

00:14:46.599 --> 00:14:47.799
praying for them.

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:52.879
We notice in Romans chapter number 15 that near the end of the book, there's 16 chapters,

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:59.159
but here in the 15th chapter is Paul is making really some personal statements and some plans

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:03.599
that he has and giving some greetings in the 16th chapter and so on and so forth, that

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:09.079
near the end of the 15th chapter, in fact, in verse number 30, notice what he says, now

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:10.439
I beseech you.

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:14.839
Now, that's not a word that we use all of the time today, but we would, if we were to

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:20.119
use our terminology, we would say that Paul is in essence saying, I'm begging you.

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.319
I beseech you.

00:15:22.319 --> 00:15:28.039
We see the use of the word in Romans chapter number 12, when he says, I beseech you therefore,

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:32.919
brethren, that you, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice,

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:37.559
wholly acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:42.279
this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:46.759
good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:51.519
He was begging them based on all that he had told them about the importance of presenting

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.719
their bodies a living sacrifice.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:58.519
Now when he uses this word in chapter 15 and verse number 30, notice what he says, now

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:03.979
I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit,

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:14.659
notice what he says, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:19.659
Notice what he says in verse 31, that I may be delivered from them that do not believe

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:26.179
in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints,

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:31.499
that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:35.339
Now the God of peace be with you all, amen.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:39.659
So we find that Paul says, I'm beseeching you that you would pray for me, and here's

00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:41.579
how I want you to pray for me.

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:46.219
There were some specific things that Paul gave to the believers in Rome with regard

00:16:46.219 --> 00:16:51.459
to their intercessory prayer for the Apostle Paul and for the work of the ministry.

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:55.379
Notice if you will, in Ephesians, we mentioned already that in the book of Ephesians that

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:58.259
Paul says that he's praying for those believers.

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:01.619
He outlines for them in the first chapter again.

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:06.699
We find that in the third chapter that Paul will outline a prayer for these believers

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:08.139
and how he's praying for them.

00:17:08.139 --> 00:17:13.619
But as we go to the sixth chapter of the book of Ephesians, and he's nearing the end, he's

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.459
gone through the fact that we're engaged in spiritual warfare, that we need to put on

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:24.179
the whole armor of God, how important these truths are, that he says in verse number 18,

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:31.019
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.459
all perseverance and supplication for all saints.

00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:39.699
Notice the first few words of verse 19, and for me.

00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:42.299
So he tells them, you need to be engaged in prayer.

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:46.179
And by the way, you're praying not only for all of these saints at the end of verse number

00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:50.719
18, being engaged in intercessory prayer, but then he says, and pray for me.

00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:57.079
Notice what he says, that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly

00:17:57.079 --> 00:18:03.039
to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:07.079
I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:12.559
Now when you think about the Apostle Paul, honestly, do you think of an individual that

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:16.719
would need someone to pray for him to have boldness?

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:18.299
Honestly.

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:22.019
If you think about the Apostle Paul, if you've read the New Testament, if you've studied

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:27.939
the missionary journeys, if you've studied the travels and the ministries of the Apostle

00:18:27.939 --> 00:18:32.899
Paul, you see that he is a man that has great boldness and great courage.

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:34.479
Would you agree?

00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:39.500
But yet he says to these believers in Ephesus, pray for me that I would have boldness.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.899
Wow.

00:18:40.899 --> 00:18:45.899
Is that not something that we ought to be asking for people to pray for us to have boldness?

00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:50.899
He says that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make

00:18:50.899 --> 00:18:53.179
known the mystery of the gospel.

00:18:53.179 --> 00:18:54.459
Wow.

00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:59.820
We are to have boldness as we go out as the ambassadors, as the representatives of our

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.019
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:04.019
And Paul says, here's how I want you to pray for me.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:07.139
Pray that I'd have boldness.

00:19:07.139 --> 00:19:11.700
I'd like to think that the believers in Ephesus prayed that way.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.820
Amen?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.820
I'd like to think that if I were to send you a letter, if another brother or sister

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.619
were to send you a letter and say, hey, would you pray for me specifically about this thing?

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:25.579
I'd like to think that you would.

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:26.579
Amen?

00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:30.859
When missionaries send us update letters, we have the opportunity to hear how things

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:35.099
are going and how God is working, but then they'll include, would you pray about these

00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:37.059
things specifically?

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:38.059
So what do we do?

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:39.579
We engage in prayer.

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:45.940
We go before the throne of grace on the behalf of others, people that we may never meet until

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.380
glory.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.579
We pray for them.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:54.260
And then the encouragement comes, not only when we're able to send them a note and say,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.859
I'm praying for you, and they receive encouragement, but the encouragement for us as the one praying

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:01.940
is when we get the next update letter.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.740
and read about how so-and-so trusted Christ as their Savior,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.980
about how so-and-so was invited to a special meeting,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.900
and we begin to see how God answers prayer.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.500
That's encouraging for us as the people of God.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.900
Notice in the book of Colossians,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.020
the passage in which we've dealt with here

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.380
is our springboard in verse number three of chapter one,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.700
praying always for you.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.260
But notice in Colossians chapter number four,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.260
the Apostle Paul tells these believers in Colossae

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.740
in verse number two, continue in prayer

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.060
and watch in the same with thanksgiving.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.180
Notice verse number three, with all,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.460
praying also for us that God would open unto us

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.020
a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.380
for which I am also in bonds

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.100
that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.540
Paul tells them in the beginning of the book,

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.220
I'm praying always for you.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.140
Now would you pray for me?

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.540
And here's how I'd ask that you'd pray for me.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.980
The example in the word of God of intercessory prayer.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.380
Paul says it this way in first Thessalonians five

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.060
in verse 25, very simply, brethren, pray for us.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.260
Pray for us.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.940
He says it again in second Thessalonians chapter number three

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.060
in verse number one, he says,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.779
finally, brethren, pray for us.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.620
And we begin to understand and look to the word of God

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.900
and see the example of intercessory prayer.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.100
We see it all throughout the New Testament.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.100
We see these believers, these that have gone before us

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.260
that have understood the importance,

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.020
the significance of intercessory prayer,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.700
the privilege of going to the throne room of heaven

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.380
on the behalf of others.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.700
And not only does Paul share with us

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.740
that I'm praying for you,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.260
and here's how I'm praying for you

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.819
as we read the Scriptures and the individual recipients,

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:56.720
but we find that Paul then says, would you pray for me?

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.920
You know, it's a great thing to look to God

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.840
and to understand that God is a God

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.720
who hears and answers prayer.

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:10.760
When I say to you, when you say to me, I'm praying for you.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.240
What does it do for you?

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.440
I hope it encourages you.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.839
And here's the reality, as fellow believers,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:22.520
as Bible-believing Christians,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.960
if brother Tony comes to me,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.880
and I've known brother Tony for a long time,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.000
and I understand that he's saved, that he's trusted Christ,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.720
he's serving the same God and the God of the universe,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.760
and he says to me, pastor, I'm praying for you.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.919
You know what I understand about that?

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:42.520
I understand that Tony is going to the God of the universe,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.360
the sovereign God on my behalf,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.960
the God who is able to do exceeding,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.639
abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:52.300
Can I tell you how much different that is

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.580
than just somebody in the world that says,

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.699
actually, they've changed it.

00:22:56.699 --> 00:22:58.900
Now they like to say, I'm thinking about you.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.979
Am I right?

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:03.059
Seriously.

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:05.220
It used to be that they'd say, I'm praying for you.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.020
Who are you praying to?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.260
You don't believe in the same God that I believe in.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.860
You're not serving the same God that I serve.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.500
So who exactly are you praying?

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.779
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:17.100
And so I'm not seeking, through this message,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.779
to criticize those individuals.

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:20.100
That's not the point of my message.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.540
That's not the point of the subject matter.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.339
But what I want to encourage you with this morning

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.740
is that as fellow believers,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.020
when we say that we're praying one for another,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.860
when you communicate to me or I communicate to you

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.100
that I'm praying for you, that we serve the same God

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.820
and He is Jehovah God.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.979
He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,

00:23:40.979 --> 00:23:42.460
the first and the last.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.580
He is the omnipotent God who reigns,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.419
who's able to do exceeding, abundantly above

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:51.100
all that we ask or think.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.740
With Him, nothing is impossible.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.699
You understand the significance of the statement

00:23:56.699 --> 00:23:58.339
when someone would say to you,

00:23:58.339 --> 00:23:59.900
when you would say to someone,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.860
I'm praying for you.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.220
It's powerful.

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:08.540
It's a privilege that is ours.

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:15.139
I don't say to Armando and Deanna on Friday

00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:17.860
when Camila was going to have her procedure,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.019
I didn't just say, I'm thinking about you.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.980
That's not what I texted you, is it?

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.220
Armando's not here this morning, he's home with Camila,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.100
but that's not what I texted Armando.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.820
Maria, when Manuel was going into surgery,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.540
did I say I'm thinking about you?

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.380
No.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.459
I'm praying.

00:24:37.459 --> 00:24:40.500
Oftentimes, if you, I'd let you look at my text messages,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.700
I don't have anything to hide,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.420
but I sent text messages to pastor friends this morning.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.019
And I didn't just say, I'm thinking about you.

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:50.260
I said, I'm praying for you,

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.380
and here's how I'm praying for you.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.260
I'm praying that God would give you boldness

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.299
as you stand behind the sacred desk.

00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:58.260
I'm praying that the people of God

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.820
would be attentive to the preaching of the Word of God,

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.299
that decisions would be made

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:05.260
that would glorify God Almighty.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.059
That's how we pray one for another.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.940
And listen, as a receiver, it encourages me.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.899
As the one praying, it encourages me

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:22.899
when I get to hear how God worked and what God did.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.899
We serve an awesome God.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.580
And prayer is not designed

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.179
to just be a grocery list of my needs.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.860
Amen?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.019
It really isn't.

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:42.500
This aspect of intercessory prayer is biblical.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.019
In fact, as I look to the Word of God,

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:48.779
I see more examples of intercessory prayer

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:50.420
than I do of personal prayer.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.700
Not only do we see the example,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.980
say it's great, we got some Bible truth.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.220
How does it apply?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.059
I would say this,

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.540
if I were giving you points this morning,

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.540
number two, purpose to engage in intercessory prayer.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.619
Intercessory prayer.

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:13.299
Not only do we consider the example of intercessory prayer,

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:15.459
but when we see that example,

00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:18.619
then we ought to purpose in our lives

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:22.580
to engage in intercessory prayer.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.820
Now let me say this,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.260
if you have not engaged in intercessory prayer,

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.299
if it's a new subject matter to you,

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:30.480
and you've not heard of this,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.700
you've not been thoughtful of this truth,

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.860
then I would not expect you to be praying always,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.700
night and day,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.080
and all of these things that we see

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.619
in the life of the Apostle Paul,

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:41.899
but I would expect that you would purpose to engage

00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:44.360
in that you would start somewhere

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.260
on engaging in intercessory prayer.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.380
Here's the reality,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.459
if I'm going to engage in intercessory prayer,

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:53.580
I need to have some knowledge and some information

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.720
in order to do so.

00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:57.860
I'm not suggesting this morning

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.860
that we want to know every detail

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.100
about one another's lives and so on and so forth,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.739
but there's some specific things

00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:06.540
that if I'm going to engage in intercessory prayer,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.739
it's good for me to know,

00:27:07.739 --> 00:27:11.059
to have the knowledge so that I can pray specifically.

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.500
There have been times in which,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.339
I'll use Brother Mark as an example,

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:16.940
he's had some test or some things coming up,

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.940
and I knew about it,

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.580
he communicated it to me, why?

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.080
So I could pray for him.

00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:24.459
Someone has a medical test that's coming up,

00:27:24.459 --> 00:27:26.739
someone has an interview,

00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:29.220
somebody has an opportunity

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.860
to share the gospel with someone,

00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:34.380
we're able to pray specifically.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.860
Ms. Joyce called Holly a couple of weeks ago,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.420
I don't remember the exact date,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.299
but Ms. Joyce called Holly and said,

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:42.380
Holly, I'd like to ask if you and your family

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.019
could pray for Wally, Joyce's son Wally.

00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:48.100
And she says this on the phone to Holly,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.660
I did not speak to Ms. Joyce,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.059
she spoke to Wally.

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:53.899
And she said, Wally met somebody this morning

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:56.459
and was able to give a gospel tract to him

00:27:56.459 --> 00:27:57.779
is my understanding,

00:27:57.779 --> 00:27:59.940
and they were able to speak about the gospel

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.260
for just a moment,

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.260
and Wally invited him to have dinner at five o'clock

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.339
and they have a meeting scheduled,

00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:09.220
and Wally's whole purpose

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.100
is to give that man the gospel,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.860
would you pray?

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.279
You know what we did?

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:16.200
I'm not patting myself on the back,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.459
but you know what we did?

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:19.019
At 4.57,

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:22.640
we stopped as a family,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.480
and we prayed.

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:25.959
We prayed.

00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:28.619
We said, God, you're the God of the universe.

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:31.940
And this appointment is scheduled,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.340
and Wally purposes to share the gospel,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.119
would you soften the heart of this man?

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:38.940
Would you help him to understand?

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.299
Would you help Wally to have wisdom and discernment,

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:45.239
and to have clarity?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.820
Can I tell you the devil was working,

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.700
he got in a small accident on the way.

00:28:50.739 --> 00:28:52.460
The devil was at work.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.159
But can I tell you what happened?

00:28:55.159 --> 00:28:57.700
I think it was the next day that Ms. Joyce called Holly,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.659
it might have been that evening,

00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:01.280
I don't recall exactly the details,

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.659
but she said, I could hear over here,

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.900
Joyce's excitement.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.500
Holly, I wanted to let you know that Muhammad got saved.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.419
Hoo, glory to God.

00:29:11.419 --> 00:29:12.859
We're excited about it.

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:15.179
I don't know Muhammad.

00:29:15.179 --> 00:29:16.539
I don't know him.

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:20.299
Wally's not a member of Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:22.140
But I could pray for him.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.640
In fact, I don't even know that Wally knew

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.099
that I prayed for him.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:26.400
It doesn't really matter.

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:30.700
But we prayed, and guess what?

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.500
We get to rejoice together in the salvation of a soul

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.000
that will now spend eternity in the presence of God.

00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:43.179
I may never meet this man on this earth,

00:29:43.179 --> 00:29:48.000
but one glorious day, when we're all assembled in heaven,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.140
we'll get to see people that got saved, isn't that wonderful?

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.940
And we look and we understand the importance

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.659
of engaging in intercessory prayer.

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:59.020
Let me share with you in James chapter number five.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.900
We're gonna look at a New Testament truth,

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.859
and then we're gonna go back to the Old Testament.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:07.699
and we're going to be done. James chapter 5, only two points this morning, amen? I

00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:18.059
let you off easy. James chapter number 5, verse 13, is any among you afflicted? Let

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:24.759
them pray. Is any merry? Let them sing psalms. Is any sick among you? Let them

00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:27.739
call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him

00:30:27.739 --> 00:30:31.179
with oil in the name of the Lord. Notice verse 15, in the prayer of faith shall

00:30:31.179 --> 00:30:35.859
save the sick. The Lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sins they

00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:39.859
shall be forgiven him. I want you to really focus on verse 16. The Bible says

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:46.059
confess your faults one to another. Notice and pray one for another that you

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:51.139
may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

00:30:51.139 --> 00:30:57.699
I personally am guilty and I think many have been guilty of quoting the last

00:30:57.819 --> 00:31:02.539
part of verse number 16. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man

00:31:02.539 --> 00:31:07.739
availeth much. It's a great Bible truth, but in the context of that verse we are

00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:14.979
instructed to pray one for another, to be engaged. We see the example in the

00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:21.659
Scriptures, but oh that we would purpose as the people of God to engage in the

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:26.019
ministry of intercessory prayer. Can I tell you this morning, we had a deacon's

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:29.019
meeting yesterday in preparation for our annual business meeting next Sunday

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:33.979
night. I told our deacons yesterday morning, I said if there's ever been a

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:41.499
time that we need to pray one for another, it's now. The devil's working. He

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:49.499
knows his time is short, by the way, and he's working. Oh that we would engage in

00:31:49.499 --> 00:31:54.299
the ministry of intercessory prayer on the behalf of one another. And what a

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:58.659
privilege it is. And we see that we're to pray one for another and we have this

00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:03.619
hope, this expectation, this confidence that the effectual fervent prayer of a

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:09.059
righteous man availeth much. I was reading a story this morning about a man

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:13.139
and it's a long lengthy story about a man that was preaching at the turn of

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:17.219
the really the 20th century, so well over a hundred years now ago, that he was

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:20.459
preaching and he was going to he was in the Midwest and he was heading out to

00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:25.219
California to preach a meeting and he had the opportunity to cross paths with

00:32:25.219 --> 00:32:28.899
a husband and wife that were at the church in which he was preaching there

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:31.979
in the Midwest. And they said, could we meet with you just for a little while?

00:32:31.979 --> 00:32:38.899
Our son, his name is Jim, he's lost. He ran off a long time ago and

00:32:38.899 --> 00:32:42.939
he's gonna be in California. And we understand that you're going to

00:32:42.939 --> 00:32:50.779
California to preach. Now have you seen a map of California? Have you ever

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:58.019
been there? I lived in California. It's a big place. But they said he lives, they

00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:02.819
don't even know where he lives in California. They had received word that a

00:33:02.819 --> 00:33:07.979
friend of theirs saw him. No idea. Didn't have a chance to talk to him, not heard

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:11.819
anything from him. But we understand he's in California and we understand that

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:17.179
you're going to preach in California. We're gonna pray every day at this

00:33:17.179 --> 00:33:22.659
time in this place and we want you to commit with us to pray. And then they

00:33:22.659 --> 00:33:28.059
began to pray every day. They had a meeting. It was very interesting the way that the

00:33:28.059 --> 00:33:32.379
meeting worked. They assembled somewhere else and walked through the town to come

00:33:32.379 --> 00:33:35.659
to the place where the preaching would be. Singing along the way. It was like a

00:33:35.659 --> 00:33:43.659
half-hour walk. That's pretty cool. And they passed a pub saloon along the way

00:33:43.659 --> 00:33:49.259
and that man Jim was in there and he heard those people singing. He said, you

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:54.819
know I'm gonna follow them. And after a little while he sobered up and he was

00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:58.139
there in the meeting and he heard the preaching of the Word of God and he got

00:33:58.139 --> 00:34:06.259
saved. It's amazing. God answers prayer. And as we engage in the ministry of

00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:10.259
intercessory prayer one for another, notice in the Old Testament, go back to the book of

00:34:10.259 --> 00:34:16.979
1st Samuel if you will. We'll close here with this truth in 1st Samuel chapter

00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:23.419
number 12. As we look at this passage of Scripture I want you to note two things

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:29.659
about the verse. Number one, I want you to note the heart of Samuel. But I also

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:35.419
want you to note the seriousness of the subject. We see in here the heart of

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:39.859
Samuel but we also see the seriousness of the subject in context so that we

00:34:39.859 --> 00:34:44.459
understand what's going on here. You understand that at this point in Israel's

00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:50.779
history they had not yet had a king. But they desired a king. Give us a king! We

00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:55.059
want to be like all the other nations, right? That's what they said. Samuel's

00:34:55.059 --> 00:35:00.500
heart was broken over this. Samuel was struggling with this whole situation

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:07.419
with regard to their desire and the heart of the nation of Israel and

00:35:07.419 --> 00:35:11.019
wanting a king. Why? Because they understood that it was a theocracy, that God was their

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:18.819
king. Now they want a man to be their king. And Samuel is going to address the

00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:24.139
nation of Israel and he has been a faithful servant of the Lord. We will

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:29.539
not take time to get into the entirety of Samuel addressing the people but we

00:35:29.539 --> 00:35:34.819
find that as he's addressing them he's challenging them. And then the passage

00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:40.179
really turns back to himself for he says in verse 23 of 1st Samuel 12, he says

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:51.739
moreover as for me. So we know the heart of Samuel. He sees what's going on in the

00:35:51.739 --> 00:35:59.339
nation in a broader sense and he's he's hurting because of it. But at the end of

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:10.500
this passage he says moreover as for me. God forbid that I should sin against the

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:23.059
Lord in ceasing to pray for you. Is that not serious? You see the heart of Samuel

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:28.779
but you see the seriousness of the subject. He says God forbid that I should

00:36:28.779 --> 00:36:37.059
sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you. Now think about that just for a moment.

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:42.459
I'm not sure that we think in this fashion that we think that if I fail to

00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:47.899
engage in intercessory prayer that it's it's sinning against the Lord. We

00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:53.539
understand here that Samuel is revealing to us the seriousness of the

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:56.939
subject matter which is before us. He continues and says I will teach you the

00:36:56.939 --> 00:37:00.739
good in the right way. Only fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:04.459
your heart for consider how great things he had done for you. But if you shall do

00:37:04.459 --> 00:37:08.819
wickedly you shall not you shall be consumed both he and your king. But we

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:14.299
focus on verse 23 in his heart and the seriousness of the subject. Why is it

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:19.579
perhaps that as we read the New Testament that we see so often referenced

00:37:19.579 --> 00:37:26.219
this subject of intercessory prayer? I am praying for you. We are praying for you.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:32.019
Brethren pray for us. When you go to God in prayer pray that God would help not

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:35.699
only pray for all the Saints but for me that I would have boldness. We see it all

00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:39.939
throughout the New Testament. The example is there but when we look at the example

00:37:39.939 --> 00:37:43.059
we could walk away and say well that's nice I'm glad that Paul wasn't you know

00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:50.659
he thought it was important. No that we would purpose as believers in 2021 that

00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:57.939
we're going to engage in the ministry of intercessory prayer. It's gonna take

00:37:57.939 --> 00:38:06.659
time. It just is. By the way prayer takes time. Prayer is work. You know why prayers

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:15.059
work? Because the devil doesn't want you to pray. He doesn't. Prayers work. Don't

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:18.819
raise your hand but how many of you have ever tried to pray? It seems like your

00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:22.259
mind just gets so distracted. There are so many other things that come up. There's

00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:25.179
an interruption. There's a phone call. There's a text message. There's a

00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:37.140
whatever. Happens often. I've shared in the past I like to pray out loud. Why? It

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:44.579
helps me to stay focused. If I'm just praying silently my mind can ramble all

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:47.459
over the place and I don't even know who I just got done praying. I'm just being

00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:53.299
honest. It happens. I did something. I wouldn't I would challenge you to do it.

00:38:53.299 --> 00:38:59.339
It was it was a little bit I don't know what the right word to be sobering maybe.

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:05.219
You know what I did one morning Brother Mark? I recorded myself praying out loud.

00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:10.659
I took my phone and I placed it there and I hit record and I recorded as I

00:39:10.659 --> 00:39:15.820
prayed. You know why I did it? So I could hear what was I praying for. Did I stay

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:21.859
focused? Did I ramble? Did I get distracted? It was a good exercise. I've

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:27.859
only done it once. Maybe I need to do it again but you understand. It was a good

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:33.099
exercise. This morning I hope that each one of us would understand the

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:38.299
importance of the subject matter but more importantly than understanding the

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:43.019
importance of the subject matter that we would purpose to engage in intercessory

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:48.019
prayer that we would take the time to say to another believer, how can I pray

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:55.739
for you? How can I pray for you? Specifically, how can I pray for you?

00:39:55.739 --> 00:40:01.339
Because I'm gonna go to God in prayer. I'm gonna seek the Almighty Omnipotent

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:04.979
God on your behalf.

00:40:04.979 --> 00:40:14.699
have. That's powerful, and that is a privilege that is ours. We normally have

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:24.179
just one special in a service. There's a song that Julianna has worked on for

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:28.019
being able to sing at some point, and I asked her this morning, I said, Julianna,

00:40:28.019 --> 00:40:32.379
do you have that song that you could sing for us at the end of the message?

00:40:32.379 --> 00:40:39.779
It's called, I can pray for you. I can pray for you. I've asked Julianna before

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:44.539
we have our invitation this morning if she would come and sing that song, and I

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:52.419
hope that it would just encourage you, challenge you, to think about the

00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:59.579
privilege that is ours to pray one for another.
