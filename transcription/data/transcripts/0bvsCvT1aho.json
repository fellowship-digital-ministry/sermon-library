  "text": "1 John chapter number two and verse number six. And we, of course, this Wednesday is actually our fourth week dealing with this thought from 1 John chapter two and verse number six. And we've been dealing for a number of months now here on Wednesday evenings with this series doing what we ought to do. And a few weeks ago, as we started looking at 1 John chapter number six, we said this, that we ought to walk as Christ walked. And we gather that from this verse of scripture in 1 John two and verse six. The Bible says, he that saith he abideth in him, notice, ought himself also so to walk even as he walked. And of course, as we've gone through these last few weeks, we said that Jesus walked wisely, he walked humbly, he walked purposefully. And last week we dealt with the subject that he walked courageously. And I'm thankful for the opportunity that we have to study the New Testament and specifically with regard to this thought as dealing with walking as Christ walked, that we have the gospel records that have been provided for us so that we can see how Christ lived his life, how he walked, how he left us an example that we should follow his steps. And so this evening, it's the fifth point in this little mini series, but it's the only one that we'll look at tonight. I want you to consider this truth, Jesus walked compassionately. He walked compassionately. And go back to the book of Mark, if you will, we're gonna look at two passages of scripture in the gospels to prove the point that our Lord walked with compassion and dealing with that subject and then what it means for us, for you and for me to also walk with compassion. How is it that we can walk with compassion as Christ did? What does that look like? What does it mean? And so notice, if you will, there in Mark chapter number one, pick it up with me in verse number 40. The Bible says this, and there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. I want you to notice several things about this leper. We're gonna look at verse 41 and 42 in just a moment as we deal with how Christ walked compassionately. But I want you to notice just a few things about this leper as the Bible tells us in verse number 40 that there was this leper. And of course, we understand the difficulty with leprosy and the problem during, especially in this particular time and what's going on. The Bible says that he came to Jesus, notice, beseeching him, begging, and kneeling down to him. And then notice what he says at the end of verse number 40. He says, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And I love the way that this leper approaches the Lord Jesus Christ, because he obviously understood something about the power of the Lord Jesus Christ. He understood that Christ had the power to heal him. That's pretty amazing. And you see the faith of the individual coming and asking, he's not gonna ask if he doesn't think it's possible. And he says that he knew this, he had this understanding, if thou wilt. Now, listen, we have to recognize it's gotta be within God's will. Amen. And God can do anything. And there are times in which, and we find the scripture say that we're to pray according to his will. And we understand that principle. And here this leper says, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And notice what Jesus in the response in verse 41, the Bible says in Jesus, notice this, moved with compassion. He put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him, I will, be thou clean. I want you to notice where the Bible says that he was moved with compassion. We find that that word compassion, that emotion, if you will, it carries with it the idea of painful sympathy. It's really a mixed passion compounded of both love and sorrow. And we come up with this truth of the Lord Jesus Christ, he's moved with compassion, he sees the condition of this individual. And here in Mark chapter number one, we find that Jesus is moved with compassion because of a physical need, because of a physical ailment, because of something that was wrong with this man physically, he was a leper. And this was a serious condition, a serious situation. And the Bible says that Jesus is moved with compassion. He puts forth his hand and he simply says this after he touches him, by the way, that's amazing in of itself because you wouldn't touch a leper. And he touched him and he said, I will, be thou clean. Now, I believe that the leper probably was pretty thankful that he asked Jesus, amen. You know, what does he say? You have not because you ask not. Is that what the scriptures teach us? The scriptures also teach us that you have not because you ask amiss. And so we understand those two principles, but I want you to see here that this leper had the courage and boldness to ask and Jesus says, I will be thou clean. And as soon, verse 42, as he had spoken immediately, the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed. And we see here that Jesus walked compassionately. We had visited this passage of scripture a couple of weeks ago when we spoke about the fact that Jesus walked purposefully, that everything that Jesus did was with a purpose and on purpose and for a purpose. And here as we continue through Mark chapter number one and we come to this truth that he walked compassionately. I said this last Wednesday evening that as we look at these various aspects of how Christ walked, that what we have to understand is that oftentimes they were all intertwined one with the other. He walked purposefully, he walked courageously, he walked compassionately. Those are the last three that we've dealt with. He walked in wisdom. We talked about the fact that he walked wisely. He walked humbly. And so as we look at those things and we see how they're interconnected one with the other and here because of a physical condition, Jesus is moved with compassion. Notice, if you will, back in the gospel of Matthew in Matthew chapter number nine. And we find that the Bible would share with us a familiar passage of scripture, one in which we're very familiar with in Matthew chapter nine and it's a passage that we often reference at least the latter part of verses 37 and 38 where Jesus gives the instruction about the harvest being plenteous and the laborers are few. But I want you to notice if you begin reading in Matthew nine in verse number 36, the Bible says, but when he, speaking of Jesus, saw the multitudes. Notice what the Bible says. He was moved with compassion on them. He was moved with compassion in Mark one. And here in Matthew nine, the Bible says that he saw the multitudes and he was moved with compassion on them. Notice why, because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. We find that Jesus then looks to his disciples and he says to his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. If it was true then, it is true now. And we see it in such a great light this evening that indeed the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few. And we're reminded of that regularly. I was at a pastor's meeting, the monthly AIBF meeting that I attend. And yesterday I was there and heard more about churches without pastors and that situation that's going on in mission fields and missionaries coming home and so on and so forth. But I want you to notice that before we ever get that truth that Jesus gives to the disciples in verse 37 and 38, that we're told that Jesus, he saw the multitudes and he was moved with compassion. I would believe and I would say it this way, that in Mark chapter number one, Jesus was moved with compassion over a physical need. But here in Matthew chapter number nine, I believe that Jesus is moved with compassion over a spiritual need. And we find that he says, because they were as sheep scattered abroad without a shepherd. And we find that he then says to pray to the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest. And so we'd see the spiritual aspect of this particular text of scripture and the purpose. There's many other examples that we could go to within the gospels in which Jesus moved with compassion and we see the compassion of our God. And we can rejoice that God tells us in his word that he is compassionate. And we see that declaration, but it's one thing to see and to hear where God says, I am a compassionate God. It's a whole nother thing to see him moved with compassion and to see how he how that compassion is visible through his actions. And so we find here in the text of scripture that there's a spiritual situation, a spiritual need that leads to the Lord Jesus Christ being moved with compassion. He knew their spiritual condition. He was aware of their spiritual need and he's moved with compassion. Can I tell you this evening that both the physical and the spiritual should have an influence and an impact on us? And it's amazing to me how easy it is for people to be moved with compassion at physical needs but not at spiritual needs. And can I tell you this evening that the greatest need of humanity is a spiritual need? And I don't say that to minimize the physical needs that individuals have. I don't say that to minimize or to overlook the fact that there are people that are hungry, there are people that need clothing and I understand that and so do you but the reality is that you can feed someone, you can clothe someone, you can teach someone, you can give someone an education, you can provide for them a job and you can provide housing and so on and so forth but if you never tell them about Jesus and about their soul then what's gonna happen is they're gonna die and then go to a Christless eternity and all we've really done is made their life here a little bit more comfortable. Does that make sense tonight? And I wanna say that with compassion and I hope that it's being received in the way that I'm seeking to communicate it this evening because no doubt the physical need is real and there are individuals with physical needs but even as our missionaries and at times as we've had opportunity to help in certain situations with physical needs, our goal is not to stop at the physical, our goal is also to try to meet the spiritual need because that's the greatest need and so we find this evening that Jesus, he walked compassionately. So what's the, we see the truth, we see the example in both of these passages of scripture in Mark one and in Matthew nine where he was moved with compassion in Mark's gospel a physical condition or need, in Matthew's gospel because of a spiritual condition or need and so what is the instruction for us this evening? Where is it that we find that we too are to walk or to live with compassion? Turn to the book of Luke if you will in the 10th chapter. In Luke chapter number 10, this too is a familiar passage of scripture and I want you to see this truth that is given to us this evening in this portion of scripture with regard to us and the need for us to be compassionate with those that we come in contact with. You're there in Luke chapter number 10, the Bible says this beginning in verse number 30, and Jesus answering said, a certain man went down from Jerusalem. He went from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead. Can I pause just for a moment and let you know that this did happen regularly. This was a situation that Jesus is teaching and it's something that they could identify with and relate with that this was something that took place on occasion. And so we find that Jesus as he's answering the one that says who is my neighbor according to verse 29, we find that Jesus gives him this scenario if you will, and he says that this man, he was robbed, he was left for dead, he was half dead, verse 31, and by chance there came down a certain priest that way. And so we find that the Bible says that there's this certain priest that goes and as he's journeying, Jesus as he's speaking to this man and giving him the truth, he goes that way, the way in which this man was left and it says and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. That's interesting, is it not? The Bible clearly tells us that Jesus in speaking to this man, he says he saw him. You're in a situation where you try to act like you didn't see something because you don't want to be bothered by it, you want to just be able to keep on going, well, it says he saw him. And he passed by on the other side and likewise, so that was a priest in verse 32, likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him and passed by on the other side. That's a step worse in my mind, he didn't just see him as the priest did in verse 31, but the Bible says that this Levite, he comes at the same place and he looked on him. There's a difference between seeing something and looking at something, would you agree? There's a difference between seeing something and looking at something. And listen, there's some things you can't help seeing, but you can choose what you look at, amen? That's why Jesus in Hebrews, it says looking unto Jesus. It's a decision, a choice that we make on where we fix our gaze upon. And here the Bible says that this Levite, he came and he looked on him and passed by on the other side. Verse 33, but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was. And when he saw him, notice what it says, he had compassion on him. Now, we understand and we don't have time this evening to deal with all of the background with regard to how the Jewish people viewed the Samaritans and all that's taking place with regard to Jesus talking about a priest and a Levite and then a Samaritan in verse 33. But we find that the Samaritan, it says of him that he saw him and he had compassion on him. And notice it says, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. By the way, what you read in verse 34 and following is what reveals the compassion. We can say that we have compassion, but it's seen in our actions. Just as the case was with Jesus, he had compassion on the man, so what did he do? He touched him and he healed him. He had compassion on those that were scattered without a shepherd, and so what does he say? Pray to the Lord of the harvest, by the way, who is that? It's Jesus, that he would send forth labors. You know that that's a prayer that God answers. God calls people and God sends people. And here we find that in verse number 35, it continues and says, and on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him, take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again, I will repay thee. Verse 36, Jesus says, which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said, he that showed mercy on him, then said Jesus unto him, notice, go and do thou likewise. I read an account years ago of a school of theology where the students in a particular class were tasked in this particular day to come and to give a sermon. It was a short sermon that each of the individuals in the class were to give on this passage of scripture. And the professor set a trap. And here's what the professor did. The professor gave the assignment that here's the text of scripture that you're gonna preach a little sermon on in class. But what he did is he had something staged along the way where there was a fellow student that was in need. And everyone that was in that class that was to preach on that particular text of scripture passed right by their fellow student in need so that they could get to class and preach a sermon on the Good Samaritan. Isn't that interesting? The reality is that we find here in the text of scripture that this illustration that Jesus gives of the one, this Samaritan, that what did he do? Well, because of his compassion, because he saw someone in need, and again, here in our text of scripture, this is a physical need. This is a physical need. Well, the reality this evening is that we can't meet everyone's physical need. You understand that? The physical needs of this world far surpass our ability individually or even collectively to be able to even begin to help. It's amazing. And we find that it requires much wisdom and discernment with regard to several of those things, and I don't wanna get into all of that this evening, but if you have questions, I'd be more than happy to discuss that with you with regard to just having wisdom and discernment on where is it that I help? What is it that I help with? And where's a need that I can try to help and satisfy? But we find here that Jesus uses this account, and he gives this parable, if you will. with regard to this lawyer that was asking these questions, and Jesus is painting this picture and helping to illustrate, and then he says, go and do thou likewise, in verse number 37. And so we see here the instruction with regard to our response and being able to minister to individuals and seeing a physical need and where it is that God would allow us to have opportunity to be able to help with those things, by having compassion. But now I want you to turn to the book of Jude, if you will. Turn to the book of Jude, and as you turn to the book of Jude, it's only one chapter, but what a power-packed chapter of God's word this is. The book of Jude, just a, again, a very short letter, 25 verses in the book of Jude, but you could spend just about a verse a week going through it and really getting what God has for us throughout this text of scripture. We find that as you begin looking through this short epistle that there's an introduction that's given with regard to the reason, really, for the writing, and you see that in the very beginning where it says in verse three that it was needful for me, right in the middle of the verse, to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. Why? Why is there this epistle, this short letter that's being written to help these individuals to earnestly contend for the faith? Well, because in verse number four, there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and we find that then after the introduction is given with regard to the reason for the writing that the text begins to deal with and exposing false teachers. We find that as the text deals with the false teachers, he uses examples from Old Testament, he goes through and provides descriptions and dealing with the judgments and so on and so forth, and we see that really all the way to verse number 16, and then you find that beginning in verse number 17, it really changes a course, if you will, the direction of the letter, because in verse 17, it says, but beloved, and so now after the instruction is given with regard to the false teachers that have crept in unawares and how they're operating and all of those things, the examples from the Old Testament so that we could understand how they behave and what their tactics are, but also how God dealt with them, we then find that he says, but beloved, and so the letter is now going back to the believers with regard to how they are to live and really some instruction for us, and I want you to notice that the Bible tells us in verse 17, but beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust. Now isn't that interesting? We've been studying in 2 Timothy chapter number three, what does it begin with in verse number one? This know also, and we dealt with that two weeks ago on Sunday morning, and so hey, God has informed us, he's let us know that there are going to be mockers. Peter, in 2 Peter chapter three, he talks about the scoffers and the mockers, and so he says they're going to walk after their own ungodly lust, and so God has already told us that. He says, remember that you've been told these things, verse 19, these be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit, but again, notice he says, but ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, and so we find that again, listen, this is going to happen. We knew about these false teachers. God informed us. He let us know about this, but what do we do? Do we just give up, give in, say, well, all hope is gone? No, we build up ourselves. Timothy says, continue. That's what Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy three. Listen, just because evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse, it doesn't mean you give up and give in. It means you continue, and you stand in the face of the opposition. Verse 21, keep yourselves in the love of God. By the way, aren't you thankful that there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God? I mean, praise the Lord. Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so, and I know it's a little kid's Sunday school song, but man, it's a precious song. I love the song that we sing, Jesus Loves Even Me, and many things in the Bible I read, but this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me, isn't that a wonderful song? And praise the Lord for it, and so here it says, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, and then notice what the Bible says in verse 22, and of some, have compassion making a difference. Verse 23, and others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. When I read verse 22 and 23, and of course we see, and we've mentioned many times it's, there's actually a song that we sang years ago from verse 22, called to make a difference, and certainly we are called to make a difference, and he says in verse 22, and of some, have compassion making a difference. Others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. You ever found if you, as you've tried, and attempted to share the gospel with people, that the same approach doesn't work with everyone? The same approach doesn't work, I don't mean the gospel doesn't work with everyone, obviously the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, I'm not saying that we change our message, I'm simply saying that our approach to them, how we begin to communicate to them the truth of the gospel, is going to vary based upon the individual. And here the Bible says in verse 22, and of some, have compassion. You know, I find sometimes that maybe it's challenging at times for us to have compassion on individuals, because we really don't have the heart of Christ, but we really look at them, I said this several weeks ago, as being our enemies. And I said this when I preached that text of scripture on a Sunday morning, I said this, that David never made Saul his enemy, but Saul made David his enemy continually. The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14, that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for there are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. And sometimes what happens is because somebody has a completely different worldview than we do, they believe something entirely different than we do, we look at them perhaps as being an enemy, and we don't have compassion on them. But the Bible says of some, have compassion, making a difference. It's amazing to me how blind, listen, we understand 2 Corinthians 4, the God of this world, that's a little g, God of this world, that's Satan, hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto them. When we approach people and begin to talk to them about the Lord Jesus Christ, we must not approach them and take this approach that I'm better than you. No, we need to be compassionate, because we understand their condition, we understand they've been blinded, we understand there's a spiritual battle that's taking place for the soul of that individual, and the enemy has done everything possible to be able to keep them blinded to the truth of the gospel, and then we come along and we have an opportunity through whatever means it is, whether it's just door knocking in a complete stranger, or it's a neighbor, or it's a coworker, or maybe even a family member, but we show them the love of Christ. We have compassion, why? Because we understand what happens to that individual if they die without Christ. We've read the entirety of the Bible, we've read Revelation chapter 20, we're familiar with the judgment, the great white throne judgment, and we know that, and therefore, we ought to have some compassion. I said this before years ago, and I believe that it's something that you've heard from other sources as well, even within other contexts, but the reality is that people in general don't really care how much you know until they know how much you care. And I find that to be a biblical philosophy, though you won't find those exact words in the scriptures, you will find that the Apostle Paul, as he went to minister in the city of Thessalonica, as you read the book of 1 Thessalonians, you find that the Apostle Paul was a man that moved and worked with compassion. He was a man that the Bible tells us, in fact, turn over. and just look at it, in 1 Thessalonians chapter number one and two, notice what the Bible tells us about Paul's ministry there in Thessalonica, because I believe it's important for us to understand of some have compassion making a difference. We ought to love people, to understand, listen, remember what's the compassion? Painful sympathy, a mixed passion compounded of love and sorrow. I remember Chris asking me years ago, why do you care about me? Why do you care so much? It's because you're going to die one day, and I know what the Bible teaches, and if you die without Christ, you're going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. We ought to be compassionate about that. The Bible says in the book of 1 Thessalonians, notice in chapter number one, the Bible says in verse number four, knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God, for our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power to the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as you know, what manner of men we were among you, notice, for your sake. And so we find that in verse number five, Paul talks about the gospel coming to them. It came in word and in power of the Holy Ghost, with much assurance, but also notice he says, and what, and you know, what manner of men we were among you, for your sake. And so Paul gives us some insight in verse number five, as to the approach of ministry there in the city of Thessalonica. You could go back to Acts 17, and you can read it during the second missionary journey, and you find there's not much given to us there, because they're just there for about three Sabbaths, is what the Bible says. And so we find that they got saved. The Bible says in verse number six, and you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word, and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. And these people got saved. And so why did they get saved? Well, just because they were kind men that came to the city of Thessalonica? No. Showing up as a kind person, and bringing some bread with you, and some, that's not going to save anybody. Amen? We see the manner that they came, according to verse number five, but they came with the gospel. Now, if they come with the gospel, and they come with a terrible attitude, and they come condemning, and all kinds of, are the people going to listen? Are they going to be receptive? Do you understand? Can you, are you following tonight? And so we find that the Bible says that they became followers of us, and of the Lord. They received the word, and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. Notice in chapter number two, the Bible says this, in verse number two, it says, but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile, but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God which trieth the hearts, and so we trieth our hearts. So we understand that even though they came in with a certain manner in verse number five of chapter one, and we're going to get there in just a couple of more verses to really give you the full picture of what this manner or behavior was in which they entered into the city, they came not just as nice people bringing some, they came bringing the gospel, but their manner was appropriate, their position and disposition. Could I use those two words tonight? We could track and follow that. Listen, the position is important, Jesus alone, grace alone. Amen? Is that what the Bible teaches? Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. But what's our disposition is we have the right position, we need to have the right disposition having that manner. And so Paul says, as we were allowed of God, notice what he says in verse four of chapter two, to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak. So he didn't change the message in order to be liked. Are you tracking? Notice he says in verse number four, not as pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts. So Paul says, we want to have the right disposition, but we can't sacrifice our position for our disposition. All right? So we have to speak the truth. We understand that we have to please God. We're not just trying to please men. You know what happens when you try to please men? Number one, you go insane because you can't do it. But number two, you start watering things down. Because you know what we find in second Timothy chapter number four, the time will come when they will not endure, what does it say? Sound doctrine. Amen? And so we have to be careful. So Paul says this is what we do. But notice as we continue in verse five, he says, for neither at any time used be flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness. God is witness. Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as apostles of Christ. And here it is. Here's the manner that he speaks of in chapter one in verse number five. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. So being affectionately desirous, notice what it says, of you. We were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls. Why? Because ye were dear unto us. That portion of scripture is so impactful to me because it helps us understand a proper philosophy of ministry. We've got to have the right position, but we also have to have the right disposition. And we have to understand that compassion goes a long way. You know when somebody knows that you love them and you care about them, like you truly care about their soul. It makes a difference on how they listen to your message. It makes a difference. Because they can see a genuine concern and a care and a compassion. And I believe that the apostle Paul, I believe that he ministered with compassion. I don't believe that any of those that he ministered to could honestly say, I know that people accused him in the attacks and so on and so forth that came, but I don't think they could accuse him and it be just an accusation that he didn't care about people. He cared about them. He cared about them. And this evening, our Lord and Savior, he walked compassionately. By the way, I'm thankful for his compassion that he had on me. Amen? And God has called us to walk as Christ walked, and we see all of these things on how he walked, but we see tonight that he walked compassionately. So as I examine my life, as you examine your life, we must ask ourselves this question, am I walking with compassion? Is it obvious to others when I come in contact with them that I really, truly care? Or do we see people as problems in my way? Do we have a situation like the disciples, hey Lord, they're hungry and the day is far spent, send them home. Because we don't want to be bothered with it. But what does Jesus say? Give them something to eat. Right? Give them something to eat. And this evening, we cannot walk compassionately without walking in the Spirit. We cannot show the love of Christ without walking in the Spirit. We absolutely must abide in him. Remember, it starts in 1 John 2 and verse 6, he that saith he abideth in him. The gospel of John, 15th chapter, we're to abide in him. And as we're walking with him and we're walking in the Spirit, God enables us to have and to walk with compassion. Let's pray tonight. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your Word, the truth contained therein. I pray that you'd help us tonight. Lord, as we see the example of our Lord and Savior, I pray that you'd help us also to receive the instruction for us to be compassionate, Lord, of some have compassion making a difference. And God, help us to never sacrifice our position simply for sake of a disposition. But God, I pray that our disposition would align properly even as we see there in 1 Thessalonians. Help us, Lord, to walk with compassion. Thank you for the privilege of prayer. I pray that you'd bless our time for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.",
