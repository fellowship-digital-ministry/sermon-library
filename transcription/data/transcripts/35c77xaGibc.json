  "text": "You use 50 verses of scripture and you're gonna try to turn to every one of them. We'll be here for a couple of hours, amen. And I know that you're not wanting to be here for a couple of hours. And so I've put the majority of the verses. There's one passage of scripture that I did not type out all of the 20 verses of that passage, but for everything else, I've typed out the verses so that we can see it here on the screen. In Psalm chapter 10, it's the title that I've used for the message this morning. Verse number 16 says this, the Lord is king forever and ever. The Bible says the heathen are perished out of his land. And I'm thankful to know the Lord is king forever and ever. It is important that we understand from the start this morning that our God is on his throne. I mean, right now at this very moment, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. And it's important for us to understand that. And we find that Jesus is king. Can I say this this morning? He's not on the ballot. He's not on the ballot. Why isn't he on the ballot? Because he doesn't need to be, it's his rightful place. All right, we're not voting for Jesus. Jesus is on his throne. Aren't you thankful for that? Amen. And he's not on the ballot. Listen, he always has been, and he always will be king of kings and Lord of lords. And that ought to cause us this morning to rejoice greatly. And we look at this and I got a picture there that has a Bible open to the book of Psalms. And then it has a individual that's casting a ballot. As you know, and you cannot, if you don't know, your head is in the sand. I'm not sure how you could not know. But in just a couple of weeks, we're gonna have a, actually a week in just a couple of days, an election here in our nation. And this morning, I want us to understand with great clarity that the truth of this here has to impact this here. What do I mean by that? The Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice. And it's absolutely vital that Christians once again recognize the authority of God's word and its influence on how we cast a ballot. We have the privilege of casting a ballot and I'm thankful for that. But I rejoice this morning to know that my King, my King Jesus, that he rules and that he reigns. Notice with me, we mentioned Psalm 10, 16 already, but notice if you will, in Psalm 29, in verse number 10, the Bible says this, the Lord sitteth upon the flood, yea, the Lord sitteth King forever. We find in Psalm 97 and verse number one, the Bible says this, the Lord reigneth. Aren't you thankful? The book of Revelation says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Our God reigns. And I'm so thankful this morning that we understand that and we can rejoice in that truth, but we must acknowledge that long ago, mankind rejected God as their ruler. We understand as you were to study the Old Testament and study the people of Israel, that they had a theocracy where literally God was their King. God was their ruler. And we find that they rejected God and they said this, give us a King. Samuel was disappointed with their interest in having a King. They desired to be like all the other people. They were so distinct and so unique that God was their King. They had a theocracy, but yet they wanted what the other nations of the world had. We find that Samuel was disappointed, that Samuel struggled greatly with that. But we find that in that rejection of the nation of Israel, rejecting God and changing the truth of a theocracy into a monarchy, that human history from that point forward has really plunged into the situation of having humans rule us or lead us from a government perspective. Now here's what I'm thankful for. God knew that. If you study the book of Deuteronomy, well before the people ever asked for a King, God gave instruction to Kings. Why would he give instruction to Kings if it wasn't his plan that there be Kings? Because he knew that man would not follow his plan and because he's the omniscient eternal God, he provided them with instruction and for that we can rejoice. But from that point in human history, we find that man has been ruled by humanity. Humanity has been ruled by humanity. Sometimes there have been good rulers. Sometimes there's been ruthless rulers. But consider this thought from Proverbs 29 in verse number two. When the righteous are in authority, notice what the Bible says, the people rejoice. But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. There's a contrast in this verse of Scripture between the righteous that are in authority versus the wicked that beareth rule. And we find that the contrast between the leadership has a profound impact on those that are being ruled. The Bible says that when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice. But when the wicked beareth rule, that the people mourn. Understand some foundational truth as we consider the thought this morning, as we go through this thought this morning with regard to our role in understanding biblical truth. One day, Jesus will come back and set up his millennial kingdom. He'll literally rule and reign for a thousand years. He'll rule with a rod of iron. We as the people of God will have the privilege of being able to rule with him and to experience that truth. And we find that Revelation 20 verses one through six gives in a very condensed passage that truth. We can find references to the millennium all throughout the pages of Scripture. In fact, the Old Testament prophets speak much about the millennial kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. Until that time, however, we are governed by human rulers. We have the unique blessing of living United States of America where we have elected officials. We find that as citizens, we have not only a privilege, but a responsibility to vote. But as Christians, I would say this, when it is our privilege and our responsibility to vote that we have to understand that the Bible must influence how we cast our ballot. It's absolutely imperative. I cannot separate my Christian life duty obligation from my civil duty and obligation. I am a Christian first and foremost, and therefore it must affect every part of me. I understand that in Proverbs 14 in verse number 34, the Bible says this. It says that righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. It's interesting to me when I look at this verse of Scripture that God did not say righteousness exalted Israel or sin is a reproach to Israel. The truth that is given to us is a truth that's beyond just Israel. It's for all people, all nations. And thus God says righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. Understand this in Psalm 11 in verse number seven, the Bible says that the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. He's a righteous God and he loves righteousness. The Bible tells us in Psalm 33 in verse number 12, blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. But then consider this truth of Psalm nine in verse 17, the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God. You say pastor, that's strong language, it's Bible. Our God is a righteous God and he loves righteousness. I've said this from the pulpit many times over the years, even in recent days, our nation is ripe for judgment. Our nation is ripe for judgment. We read throughout the pages of Scripture of God judging nations and peoples, even his own people because of their wickedness and because of their disobedience. America as a nation is ripe for judgment. I'm thankful that our God is long suffering. I'm thankful that he's long suffering. Consider with me this morning, we have to remember as we consider some of these foundational truths before we dig in to specifics with regarding this upcoming election. But I want you to remember that our main purpose for being left here upon this earth, Jesus said in Acts one in verse number eight, ye shall be witnesses unto me. And I want you to see I got both verses on the screen because in Acts 5.32, the disciples just, they absolutely embraced what Jesus had told them in Acts one in verse number eight, when Jesus said ye shall be witnesses unto me, then in chapter five in verse 32, they say we are his witnesses. And God's people must embrace that truth once again, that we are his witnesses. Listen, we have been given the responsibility of not only being his witnesses, but being his ambassadors. The Bible says in second Corinthians five in verse number 20, now then we are. ambassadors for Christ. I'm thankful that I'm a pilgrim. I'm a stranger. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. The reality is that I have dual citizenship. Number one, I'm a citizen of heaven. My conversation is in heaven, for which I rejoice, but I also happen to be a citizen of the United States of America. But I'm an ambassador. The Bible says at the end of that verse, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God. And it reminds us just a couple of verses earlier that God said this, that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. I'm so thankful to be reconciled. I was at variance with God. I was an enemy. I was lost and undone. But because of the work at Calvary, I've been redeemed. I've been justified. I've been reconciled. And I'm so thankful for that. And he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation. So it's important that we understand our purpose for being here on earth. Our purpose is not primarily political. Amen? That's not our purpose. Now we get to engage in that arena. We get to influence that arena, but that is not our main purpose. Our main purpose is to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I understand this morning that principles and policies matter more than personalities. Principles and policies matter more than personalities. Listen, we have to have the right position, and it's also helpful that we have the right disposition. If one of those things is going to be out of balance, it's far better to have a right position and a wrong disposition than to have a right disposition with a wrong position. Did you follow that with me? And the reality is that we want to have it in harmony. We want to have the right position, and we want to have the right disposition. We want people to know that we love them. We want people to know that we care about them, and we're giving them the gospel because we love them. Yes, we've been instructed to do so, but I don't want to be ugly about it. I want to be gracious about it. Let me say this. There will never be a candidate that aligns with you 100%. Never. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the time. Amen? What do you want for dinner? Just think about it. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the As Christians, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must no longer allow politicians to take biblical matters and politicize them. Then they demand that we as the people of God not speak up with the threat of being labeled a bigot or worse. Can I tell you? We've got to talk about the Bible. What's happened in our nation is politicians have taken biblical truth and they've politicized it. Then they've told us as Christians you don't belong in the political arena, and therefore you can't talk about it because we're going to label you as, and we're going to cancel you as, and so on and so forth. But the reality is that they're biblical principles. A bigot is defined as a person who is obstinately or unreasonably attached to a belief, opinion, or fraction. Listen, I am absolutely attached to this book. We have been called as Baptists throughout the centuries. We've been called people of the book. That's a compliment. It's a compliment. And listen, we must understand this morning, we must remember this morning that this truth of speaking on biblical matters and biblical principles is absolutely imperative. Our world is blind. Our world has been blinded by the enemy. I want to read to you a quote. It's not going to be on the screen there, but in 1983 Howard Hendricks said this, and if it was true in 1983, it's so much more true today. He said this, in a midst of a generation, or in the midst of a generation screaming for answers, Christians are stuttering. Think about that just for a moment. They're screaming for answers. Listen, our world is confused. Our world has no absolute truth because they've made themselves the authority. And when you don't have an absolute truth, when you enter into an arena of just do what makes you feel good and you redefine terms and you have no boundaries, then you end up with what we're dealing with in America today. Christians can no longer stutter. We must know why we believe what we believe and be able to speak it in love. We must be able to articulate our position. We must be able to speak on these matters. We've been given the responsibility, I'm going to say it one more time, to preach the gospel to a lost and dying world. Understand with me this morning that those with a different view are our mission field. They're not our enemy. Let me remind you of something. Saul considered David his enemy continually. But David did not consider Saul his enemy. I don't have time to develop all of that this morning, but I hope you can be mindful. Listen, Saul was hunting David to kill him. He made David his enemy continually. But David never viewed Saul as his enemy. He said, why do you come out to fight against us? I mean, he understood that Saul was anointed to be the king. And this morning, we must understand that those with a different view, they're not our enemy. You say, but they've made…they're our mission field. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. For their foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they're spiritually discerned. 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14. So let me give you some biblical principles for casting your vote. If you're taking notes this morning, I only have two points, but they're two very long points. All right? Number one this morning, biblical principles for casting your vote. I used that first slide. I'm going to show it again at the end of the presentation this morning. But the first slide was a picture of an open Bible and a picture with an American flag and an individual casting a ballot. And I say this, that there are biblical principles that must influence and impact how we cast our ballot. Know the issues and study your Bible. Don't go reading all of these political things and listening to all these politicians. No. Get into your Bible, because your Bible is the authority. Let me mention, I'm going to mention a number of things this morning that are matters that we must consider. Number one, the matter of life. Do you understand this morning that they have made life a political issue, but life is a biblical issue? God is the author and giver of life. We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 139 and verse 14, I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. Verse 15, my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. And then verse 16, it says this, thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect. And in my book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. What a marvelous passage of Scripture dealing with the sanctity of life and understanding that our God is the giver of life. The subject of abortion is all over our map today. It's all over. There's individuals that are just fighting for up until the very last moment that they could kill a baby. It's so sad. And all they want to talk about is, well, it's a choice, and it's a choice. And no, it's not a choice, it's a human being. And God is the giver of life. And we have to understand this morning that this is not a political issue, it is a biblical issue. Jeremiah 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this, sorry, I think I'm on Exodus 21, sorry. Exodus 21, notice in verse number 22 it says, if men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow. Now do you understand the language here? What's happening is there are men that are fighting, they hurt a woman that's expecting, her fruit depart, she has the baby. But it says here that there's no mischief to follow. In other words, the baby survives. The baby survives. The Bible goes on to say, he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But verse 23 says and if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. What does it mean if any mischief follow? It means if the baby dies. That's what it means. And so if two people are fighting and there's a woman that's expecting that's there, and that woman gets hurt in the fight, and her baby is born. and there's no mischief, there's still a consequence, there's still a price to be paid, but if the baby dies, God says life for life. The Bible tells us in Proverbs 6 and verses 16 and 17, these six things doth the Lord hate, yea, seven are an abomination unto him, a proud look, a lying tongue, and notice, and hands that shed innocent blood. If there's ever a description of abortion that I can find in the Bible, it's hands that shed innocent blood. I believe with my whole heart this morning that if we could deal with the subject of fornication in our society, it would go a long way to dealing with the subject of abortion in our society. We live in a loose living, sexualized society, and therefore abortion is the byproduct, I don't want that consequence, I don't want that result. Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. Consider with me this morning the matter of gender, the matter of gender. God said this in Genesis 1 and verse 27, so God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. In Matthew 9 and verse number four, and he answered and said unto them, have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? We're living in a society today, listen, I don't know how you think about this, I don't know how you feel about this, but for me, when I begin to look at some of these things that are going on, I shake my head and say, how in the world did we get here? How did we get here? The slippery slope of sin. They did not want to acknowledge God, Romans chapter number one, and God gave them over to a reprobate mind. And we find this morning that we're living in the midst, listen, they don't know, they say you can figure it out at some point, no, no, we know if you're a male or a female. It's absolutely obvious and easy to identify. This idea of allowing people to think that they're something else and to participate in sports and all the others, it's nonsense, it's against God. And it's against his order. The subject of gender is not a political subject. It's biblical. God is the author and giver of life, and he's the one that determined your gender. And by the way, I'm thankful for it. Notice with me, consider number three, the matter of marriage. God instituted marriage. God instructed, gave instruction for marriage in Genesis two and verse 24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. The subject of marriage. As a nation, we bought into the lie that love is love. It's such a catchphrase today. Whatever makes you happy, no, God defined. God gave the truth. And it's important this morning that we understand that the matter of marriage is settled by God, not by politicians, it's settled by God. Let me say this, the matter of family. God designed the family, and we find that the family has been designed by God, it's been defined by God, and God has directed the family. How do we operate as husband, as wife, as children? Understand with me this morning that there is an effort to destroy the nuclear family structure as we've known it. That term nuclear family refers to a man and a woman that marry and have children and live in a home. And that's the idea of a nuclear family. And this morning, they have distorted that, they have tried to break that down. Can I tell you that those are the truths of the backbone of our society that made America what it is? It's the enemy, it's Satan that wants to attack what God instituted and to attack what God has designed, and we find that happening in the family. And it's so sad to see what's happening in our society today with regard to the family. I want you to think about the matter of justice, the matter of justice. You say that we live, you're familiar with this, the lady justice is supposed to be blindfolded. And we find that today, we live in a time in which there's, we could say that the justice is corrupt. And we don't have to, we're not exaggerating by saying that this morning, but we understand the importance of justice. The Bible says this, righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments, in Psalm 119, in verse 137. In Isaiah 59, in verses 14 and 15, there's an indictment that is made, the Bible says in verse 14, and judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off, for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Verse number 15, the Bible says this, yea, truth falleth, faileth, excuse me, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey, and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. Sad. Our God is a righteous, just God. There is right, and there is wrong. There is good, and there is evil. And God is the one that defines that. Isaiah deals with it. The Bible says that they were saying that that which was good is evil, and that which is evil is good. That's what's happening in our society today. We see it. And we begin to think about biblical principles for casting our votes, and we're gonna go stand at a ballot box, and we're gonna cast a vote, and these things that our politicians have tried to take and politicize them, we must acknowledge that they're biblical matters. The Bible tells us in Leviticus 19, in verse number 15, he shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor. In righteousness thou shalt judge thy neighbor. We find this matter of justice again living in a corrupt society with corrupt justice system. And we begin to understand the authority of those that are elected in the positions in which they're able to fill and how it affects our justice department. It's important that we understand this. I want you to think about this one, the matter of partiality. Today, many people wanna use the word racism, and I understand the term, and I understand why they use it. I use the word partiality because it's a Bible word, and I believe that partiality defines much clearer the subject than just racism, because partiality can be done without race being even in the conversation. You can be partial towards someone because of their economic status, though they are the same race as you are from that perspective of what they have as race being their calling card. You can have prejudice or partiality towards someone because of their religious identification. We see this all around the globe, by the way. You see it over in Asia, and you see it in Africa, the Middle East. You see people that have all of this partiality based on the economic status and the religious identification, and they all have the same skin color, but they're partial, they're partial. So the Bible says this in Acts 17, and it's so important that we understand this this morning, and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell in all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation. James 2, verses eight and nine, the Bible says this. If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. But if you have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors. This thing of partiality is important that we understand as biblical people. Can I help you understand an important truth that so many have missed, I believe, today, and that is this. Darwinian evolution ideology promotes further perpetuates partiality. I put up here on a screen a picture of the book that Darwin wrote. Many of you would know it by the name On the Origin of Species, and really that's the only title that they want us today to really be aware of, but I want you to understand the full title of that book goes on to say, or the preservation of favored races in the struggle of life. That's the full title of the book. You look at me like it's strange, I didn't make that up. It's the full title of the book. Wow is right, because Darwinian evolution permeates our society. And Darwinian evolution ideology not only permeates our society, but it influences our perspective, and it changes how we approach things. Listen, the second book that he wrote, The Descent of Man, I didn't take a picture of that one and put it there, but I'm telling you that Darwinian evolution is a major, major contributing factor to this subject. I was blown away when I visited England several years ago, and some of you have been to England, you know this. but when I was in England, I was absolutely blown away by the fact that while I was there, that I got some pounds, and when I got the pounds, that Charles Darwin is on one of their notes. We have folks on our notes, and we talk about the presidents that are on the notes, and so on and so forth, on our paper bills, and even on our coins, and one of those, I think it was a 10, a British pound, a 10 currency, and it had Charles Darwin's face on that bill. It's sad. Can I tell you this? Partiality existed way before Charles Darwin, okay? Just as it said in James two and verse number nine, the truth of being in sin if you show partiality, partiality in racism, it's sinful, it's wicked. It's been going on for centuries. Jesus was the one that said in John four, thy must needs go through Samaria. Why did he have to go through Samaria? Why does that interaction take place? Well, because the Jewish people hated the Samaritans. They were partial towards them, and Jesus was showing them that we're all of one blood. Jesus further said in Acts one and verse number eight, ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea, help me, Samaria. Why did he say Samaria? Why do you think he said Samaria? Because he's talking to Jewish people, and they had to know that the Samaritans also had to hear the gospel. As much as Darwinian evolution ideology further perpetuates the idea of partiality, I mention this. Listen, it existed before Charles Darwin, but at the time of Charles Darwin and his prominence and all that he did, can I tell you what happened? All of a sudden, especially men like Adolf Hitler and others, they took and they ran with the fact that now science and biology supports my wicked heart and my agenda to be able to have this perspective and to kill masses of people. Until then, partiality existed, but now all of a sudden, it could be justified in the wicked hearts of mankind because science supports it. No, science doesn't. We're all of one blood. I'm thankful for that. God created man in his own image. As much as we find that Darwinian evolution perpetuates, I want you to understand that the Bible, that the gospel and biblical Christianity is the answer. Why is it the answer? Well, notice he said in Mark 16 and verse 15, and he said unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. We find that the Bible tells us in the book of Colossians chapter three and verse number 11, where there's neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all. What's he talking about? In the church, listen, we're made up of different nationalities or backgrounds, but we're saved by the blood of Christ and we're brothers and sisters in Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ and the truth of biblical Christianity will absolutely be the answer to partiality. I wanna remind you that in the book of Revelation chapter five and verse number nine, the Bible says they sang a new song and here's what they said. Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of notice every kindred and tongue and people and nation. Hallelujah. I love our church. I mentioned this often to individuals about the diversity of our church. I absolutely love it. I don't know today as we'd go around and determine where people are originally from, there'd be a number of nations that are represented and I love that. You know why I love it so much? That's what heaven's gonna be like. That's what heaven's gonna be like. The gospel in biblical Christianity is the answer for partiality. Listen, our world is trying to use this thing of partiality specifically in America of racism to divide, to cause hatred and we must understand that the Bible speaks on this. The Bible speaks on this. It's not a political issue. Think about this, the matter of, this is the last one I'm gonna deal with, the matter of debt. You know how in debt we are as a nation? It's absolutely sickening how in debt we are and here's what the Bible says in Proverbs 22 in verse seven, the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender. As a nation, I'm gonna put up some numbers here and it's hard for us to understand these but as a nation, our current debt is nearing $36 trillion. That's a lot of money. To be honest with you, Ron, I can't even think about that kind of number. I don't even know how many zeros there are. Actually, I was working on it this week trying to figure it out. I was trying to do math on these numbers and you know what the calculator did? Error. There ain't enough space on the calculator. 36 trillion is what we're nearing. This year alone, $892 billion to pay just for the interest of our debt and for some reason, we can't help people that were devastated by a hurricane. You understand what I'm saying? They made it political but there's a biblical truth that the borrower is servant to the lender and we need some fiscal responsibility. Listen, how does it work in your home? You have to be responsible to pay your bills. How does it work as a church? Why do we have a budget as a church? Why don't we just spend and spend and spend and borrow and borrow and borrow and spend and spend and spend? No, we have to be fiscally responsible. In my home, I have to be fiscally responsible. Has there ever been a situation where you said in your home, hey, we don't have the money to do this. We can't afford this right now. Why? Because you're being fiscally responsible. As a nation, we've got out of control with debt. Here's an interesting calculation. If you suppose that every $1 equals one minute, that equals 68,493 years. If we could talk about our debt in terms of time because 36 trillion is so, 68,000 years, that's 10 times, almost 10 times as long as the earth's been around. Unbelievable. I want you to understand this morning that these matters are biblical matters. But all of these matters that I touched on, they've tried to politicize. It's not an exhaustive list. Can I tell you that Israel is a biblical matter? It's not a political issue, it's a biblical issue. Amen? Can I tell you that borders, immigration, you start talking, they're all, listen, I don't have time in one service to deal with all of it, but you have a Bible. Go home and study your Bible. Go home and figure out the principles that God has given us that are to influence how we cast our ballot because if we're Bible believers, then the Bible has to influence every part of me. Not just Sunday morning, not just Sunday night, not just Wednesday night, but every part of me is impacted and affected because I am a child of God, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ. Now, let me change gears just for a moment and deal with this second. I told you my points were long. Number two this morning, biblical principles to cope with election results. You say, pastor, why are you dealing with this? Well, because my head's not in the sand. My head's not in the sand and I've heard people for years discussing whether there's election interference, election fraud, and so on and so forth, whatever term you wanna use, I've heard many of them and I'm aware of how some have taken that perspective. But I want you to understand that there are biblical principles that we must be aware of that will help me cope with the results of an election. Can I remind you this morning that there are some things that are outside of your control and there are some things that are outside of my control, but there's absolutely nothing outside of the control of my God. Nothing is outside of his control. So we must remember this morning that all things are within the control of God. And I can rejoice in that. Listen, if I had to sit around and worry about all the things that some of you have shared with me about election fraud, interference, and all that stuff, I'd have less hair than I have. I'd have more, if I had any more, it'd be gray. I'd be worried all the time. I'd have all kinds of, but listen, I don't have to worry about it. I told you last week about the friends, the niece of Jackie who told me about in Washington State, you have to write the particular party of the vote that you're casting on the outside of the envelope before you mail it in. And here's what I told her when she shared that with me. I said, listen, if I didn't know Jesus, if I didn't know God, it would drive me insane to think about those things that are going on. But I know God. I know God. And he gave me a peace. I was reading this morning in John 14, where Jesus said, my peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth. Man, I have the peace of God which passeth all understanding. Can I remind you this morning that when we talk about these election things and we talk about interference and fraud and all of those things, we're looking just at this plane. We're looking at the temporal. We're removing the eternal God who's in control. And we're saying, listen, it's not fair. That's what people want to say. Can I remind you of the. trial that Jesus had? Was it fair? Can I remind you of the trial that Stephen had? Was it fair? But God was in control. Can I tell you this? There are some times I believe with all my heart that sometimes a way, a way, that God judges a nation is through its leadership. So how do I cope? What are some biblical principles? Number one, let me give you this verse. I'll share some things here in just a moment, but let me give you a couple of verses. Psalm 75, verses 6 and 7. For promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south. But God is the judge. Notice this. He putteth down one and setteth up another. So really it comes down to this. Do we believe the Bible? Do we believe these verses of Scripture? Do we believe that God's in control? Let me remind you of Daniel 4 and verse 17. The Bible says this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know. What is it that the living may know? That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever He will and setteth up over it the basest of men. The question is do we believe the Bible? He said in Daniel 4, 17 that the living may know. As far as I know, we're all still alive here this morning. And that the living may know what? That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men. Listen, God did not create and then take His hands off. God is still very much involved in the affairs of mankind. God is still a very present help in the time of trouble. I'm thankful that God did not just remove His hands after creation, but that He withholds all things by the power of His hand and that He's involved. He knows. Listen, if it wasn't the truth, then prayer would never have been given to us to pray to the God who's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think. But He gave us prayer because He's actively involved in the affairs of mankind. Notice this truth in Proverbs 21 and verse number 1, the King's heart is in the hand of the Lord. As the rivers of water, He turneth it, the King's heart, whithersoever He will. So the question basically is this this morning, do we believe God? Do we believe God? Do we believe that in 2024 that God is still on His throne? Do we believe in 2024 that God still has a plan and that God is still able, listen, whoever you want to accuse of whatever you want to accuse them of with regard to the results of an election, I want to remind you that God's in control. Here's the thing that's important for us to understand. There were people that tried to bring me, I mean, I had videos sent to me in 2020 and I had documents printed out and sent to me in 2020. I had videos, Bart, that were, I mean, like 40 hours long of videos. I ain't watching them, man. I don't have time for that. I'm just being honest with you. You say, I watched every single one of them. I'm sorry. I'm being honest. I'm sorry. Because what it did is it messed with your head. And it caused you to not have a right view of God. Because even if all that stuff happened, you know what the bottom line is? God allowed it to happen. God allowed it to happen. And we must acknowledge that this morning. So, what do we do? How do we respond? How is it that we can cope with the results of an election? See, the reality is that in America, elections have boiled down basically to two individuals or two parties. Okay? And so, I'm not here to say how or who or any of that sort of thing. I'm simply giving you biblical principles. I think that as we study our Bibles, we have an individual responsibility. But the reality is that the one that has to be able to cope with the election results is the one that's in that situation. They're going to begin to look at some of these things and maybe their particular candidate didn't win and they wanted them to or whatever the case may be. But I have to acknowledge that God's on His throne, that God's in control. And therefore, number one, I trust the Lord. I trust the Lord. Can I tell you this morning, can I remind you this morning, that as Bible believers, our hope is not in the White House. Sometimes I fear that we say that but don't really believe that. Our hope is not in the White House. Our hope is not in the State House. Our hope is not in Wall Street. Our hope is in Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings. And for that, we trust Him. We trust Him. We come to that place where we say, I'm trusting the Lord, that His plan is perfect, that He knows what He is doing. Blessed, in Psalm 2, in verse number 12, blessed are all they that put their trust in Him. Psalm 20, in verse number 7, some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Listen, don't be putting your trust and confidence in the wrong thing. Isaiah talks about the fact that they were trusting in Egypt. That's the picture of the world. They weren't trusting the living God. They were trusting in Egypt. Jeremiah 17, in verse number 7, it says, blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is. There was a recent, I'll just say this to be pretty generic about it, but in the time that I've been here, this is the fourth election cycle, presidential election cycle, that I've had the privilege of being the pastor through. And the reality is that during one of those, somebody that's not a member of our church, never really attended our church, but a Christian worker, actually, from another church and heavily involved in some ministry things, after the result of one of those elections over the four cycles that I've been here, sent an email with this verse of Scripture and said, we have hope because of the result of the election. And I was absolutely furious. And I sent the individual an email and I said, listen, we have hope because Jesus is on His throne. Listen, if on November 6th you become depressed, your eyes aren't on Jesus. You're not trusting the Lord like you should be. Because regardless of what the result of the election is, my God's still on the throne. And my God still has a purpose. And my God still has a plan. And He's still going to use us. And by the way, one day I'm going to heaven. Hallelujah. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. That's what the songwriter said. And we need to start living like that. But the reality is that if we take the perspective that God is in control, only if my candidate wins, you are not understanding the truth of the Bible. You cannot say, because my candidate wins, that God is in control. And then if your candidate loses, you say, well, God must not be in control. They did this, they did… No, no, no, no, no. God is in control regardless. And we have to understand that. So what do I do? Number one, I trust in the Lord. Number two, I rejoice. I rejoice. You know what Jesus said in Luke? Those disciples came back because the spirits were made subject to them, and they were rejoicing, man. They saw the power of God demonstrated. And Jesus said this, don't rejoice in that. But rather rejoice, why? Because your names are written in the book. Listen, this morning, it does not matter who wins an election in this nation with regard to my eternity. I'm going to rejoice. Psalm 5 and verse number 11, but let all those that put their trust in thee, what? Rejoice. I said, number one, we must trust Him. But if I put my trust in Him, then I must rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them. Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. Can I tell you that really, if you study the church history, there has never been a nation like our nation that has had as much liberty and freedom for a church as we have experienced. And you know what's happening? We're doing less for God today than we ever have. There literally, last week, Brother Hummel stood in this pulpit and said, America is now in the place where we need missionaries to come to her. Where we used to be the number one sending mission field of the, or mission sender of the entire world. And guess what? England was that at one point. And if you go to England today, you find that church after church after church has been turned into pubs, has been turned into apartments, has been turned into mosques. And guess what has to happen in England? We have missionaries that we support from the U.S. going to England. America's not far behind. But you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to trust in the Lord. And I'm going to rejoice because my God's on His throne. And I'm going to rejoice because God is able. Listen, can I say this? Number three, continue. It's been our theme for this whole year. It's been our theme. The truth of 2 Timothy 3, verses 13 and 14. But evil men and seducers shall wax in worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. Isn't it interesting that God reveals that truth to us? And then right after revealing that truth to us in verse 13 says, but continue, in verse 14. But the evil men are waxing worse and worse. I mean, they're deceiving and they're being deceived. I mean, it's bad, it's perilous times is how it starts in chapter three in verse one. And all of this is going on. What are we supposed to do? Continue. Continue in what? Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. And we find that as we look at this truth, that we as the church of God, we must continue. We don't give up. We don't run for the hills. We don't, do you remember what Jesus said in Matthew 16? He said, I will build my church. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. This morning, we must put our trust in the Lord. We must rejoice in him. And we must continue until the trumpet sounds. I believe that one day, and I think it's soon that the trumpet of the Lord is gonna sound. We're gonna be raptured out of here. But until then, God's given us a responsibility. And we must understand that the Bible must influence how we cast a ballot. But then the Bible must also influence on how I cope with the results of an election. This morning, I'm gonna use a quote from someone that perhaps you've heard the quote before. I thought it was so pertinent to our thought this morning. But Booker T. Washington said this, a lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right, and evil doesn't become good, just because it's accepted by a majority. What defines, what is truth? Well, Jesus is truth. But then he said that he gave us his word, and his word is truth. He said, sanctify them through thy word. Thy word is truth. We must filter everything through the Bible. It means that we have to be Bible students. We have to know our Bibles. It says here that wrong doesn't become right. Who defines wrong? Who defines right? God does. Remember the one came to Jesus and said, good master? He said, why callest thou me good? There's one good, that's God. Well, Jesus is God, and he defines what's good, and he defines what's evil. And here it says that the third part here, evil doesn't become good. I understand this morning, we start getting into, well, the majority. It's never been about the majority. We don't make decisions based upon the majority. We make decisions based upon the truth of God's word. And so I submit to you this morning, as I used this line at the very beginning, that your Bible and my Bible should influence my ballot. There are biblical principles that we must understand in casting a ballot. We must no longer allow the politicians to hijack biblical truth and politicize it and then demand that you don't speak about it and that I don't speak about it, because their Bible matters. And if we're Christians, if we're followers of Jesus Christ, the Bible must influence how I vote. It influences how I live. And then how do we cope with it? Say, I don't know what's gonna happen. You don't know what's gonna happen, and if you keep watching the polls every day, you're gonna go absolutely insane. I'm telling you, it's crazy. So you know what I do? I just choose to focus on Jesus. I sat here this morning and I was praying for our service. I sat right here and I was praying this morning for a while in the sanctuary. It was just, you know, we pray, we're in the presence of God. I was just thanking the Lord for how great He is and the peace that He gives and the joy that He gives. We live in a world that's full of turmoil, chaos, confusion, but God has given us the truth. And this morning, we must allow the truth to impact every area of our lives. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word. This morning, we looked at so many verses of Scripture and quickly deal with so many matters that we face. And God, I hope that this morning, every individual has been able to see the truth that these are biblical matters. God, I pray that You would help us to remember with great clarity and conviction the reason that You've left us here, to be Your witnesses, to be Your ambassadors. You've given to us the ministry of reconciliation. God, I pray that You would help each and every one of us, Lord, to keep our eyes on Jesus. Let come what may, You rule and You reign. You are King forever and ever. And yes, we live in this incursed world and we're ruled by other humans because long ago, we rejected, humanity rejected Your rulership. And God, we pray that You would help us to be the salt and the light You've called us to be, that we would trust You, rejoice in You, and that we would continue. I pray that You'd use us for Your honor and for Your glory. Help us, Lord, to be people of the book. Well, thank You, God, for what You'll do in this moment of invitation. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand?",
