  "text": "verse of Scripture this morning, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9, and I'll give you a moment to turn there, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9 this morning. Notice the Bible says this, Wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him. Paul just concluded, as we studied last week, these first eight verses of chapter number 5, he concluded the section dealing with the certainty of heaven and the reality that all the redeemed will be with our wonderful Savior for all of eternity. What a glorious truth. Amen. What a glorious truth that God has given to us in his word so that we could have the confidence and the certainty that when this life is over, when I take my final breath here, that I can be, I can know that I'll be in his presence and I will forever be with him. We talked about last week the expectation of every believer. If you've been saved by the grace of God this morning, your expectation is heaven. You have that confidence. As he says in verse number 8, we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body than to be present with the Lord. And we have that expectation. But I said this as we concluded the message last week, that not only do we have the expectation, but we think about the excitement that should cause, that the expectation should cause us to have great excitement. Why? Because I'm going to be with Jesus. And so many people, as I mentioned last week, they want to talk about heaven and what is heaven like and so on and so forth. And there are many things that God tells us in his word with regard to describing heaven. But I want you to understand this morning that heaven is only heaven because our Savior is there. If you take all of the descriptive terms, all of the wonderful things, but if Jesus is not there, then it's not really heaven. And the amazing truth is that we find in this section of 2 Corinthians 5, verses 1 through 8, that Paul, he ended the fourth chapter talking about having that eternal perspective and immediately goes to heaven and thinking about what our future is. I said this last week, on our worst day, in our worst circumstance, we're still going to heaven. If you're saved this morning, if you've been saved by the blood of Christ and you have placed your faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, His death, burial, and glorious resurrection on your worst day, on my worst day, no matter what happens, no matter who says or does whatever it is, I'm going to heaven. I'm going to heaven. And what a blessed truth that is. Verse 9 begins in our text this morning, wherefore, for which cause, on account of, that's what it means, wherefore, based upon what has just been revealed, this is the response of the apostle Paul when he talks about heaven, when he talks about the certainty and the confidence that he has that when he finishes his life, when he takes that final breath that he'll forever be with his Lord, he says, wherefore, wherefore, I'm saved. I'm saved. I have a secure future. But notice he says, wherefore, we labor. We labor. What are we laboring for? Notice that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. He says, my future is certain. My future is secure. It got settled a long time ago when I was on the road to Damascus for the apostle Paul. His name was Saul at the time, but it was settled. We sing the song. It's not in our songbook. And well, I think we had a group of guys sing at one time, and it's a song that I remember singing when I was younger. The old account was settled long ago. And if you get a good base in there, they say, down on my knees, long ago, it was settled long ago. And certainly I remember that song as we were singing it at an old mission, a rescue mission in downtown Los Angeles. I mean, a place where some of these people, I mean, just terrible sets of circumstances, and they'd been saved by the grace of God, and they came. And I'm telling you what, you had a worship service with those folks, and you got up in there, and you're preaching, and they're worshiping the Lord. And I remember listening to those old group of guys sing, the old account was settled. Listen, it was settled for Paul. He knew where he was going. He knew that heaven was his home. It's secure. It's certain. But he says this, I'm striving to please Him. I'm laboring. I'm striving to please Him. I'm not striving to please Him so that I can be saved. I'm not striving to please Him so that I can stay saved. No, I'm striving to please Him because I'm saved. The scriptures are clear. Your behavior and my behavior matters to God. How we live matters to God. The matter of salvation is settled at the cross, and I'm so thankful for that. But then how we behave, listen, our beliefs should impact our behavior. And what Paul believed to be true as he writes to these believers in Corinth in this fifth chapter, those eight verses about heaven, he then says, wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of Him. I've simply titled the message this morning, striving to please my Savior, striving to please my Savior. Let me share with you the first thought this morning. Point number one, if you're taking notes, the desire of Paul. We're going to look at this verse really in reverse order this morning because we see the desire at the end of the verse. Notice what it says, we may be accepted of Him. Now, it's important that we understand this word accepted. It means to be well-pleasing. It means that God would look at your life and look at my life and it would be well-pleasing in the sight of God. And Paul says that his desire is that he, that we, because he's speaking to this church at Corinth, to these believers, that he's already said to them, for we know, we have this expectation, we have this certainty of heaven, but then he says we. He's including these believers. And for us this morning, that we would say collectively as Fellowship Baptist Church, that we should have the desire that we would be accepted of Him, that we would be well-pleasing in the sight of God. We find that as you look at the life of the Apostle Paul, I believe that his desire was a sincere one. I believe that as you look through his life and you trace his steps, that he earnestly desired that his life would please his Lord. He knew that he was going to heaven, that was settled, that was certain, but he wanted to live in such a way that he would please God. I believe that Paul understood and faithfully communicated with those that he ministered to that there was behavior that was pleasing to God, and there's behavior that's not pleasing to God. In fact, Paul wrote to this same group of believers in Corinth back in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, and as he spoke of those of old, referring to those in the Old Testament, he mentions to the church in Corinth that with many of them, God was not well-pleased. He goes forth and he provides several examples as to why their behavior did not please their God, and we find this morning that the Apostle Paul, he had this personal desire, but not only did he have a personal desire, he desired that those to whom God allowed him to minister, that they too would please God, that they too would have that desire, that they would be accepted of him. We find that next week as we move forward into the text of Scripture, beginning in verse number 10, what does Paul begin to talk about? He talks about the judgment seat of Christ, that we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and so understanding the certainty of heaven, understanding the certainty of the judgment seat of Christ, tucked in between those two realities, he says, here's what I do. I labor to please God. I am striving to please my Savior. This desire that he has to be accepted of the Lord. Notice with me, if you will, over in Philippians chapter number three, we'll look at a number of verses this morning in order to lay down and to prove the truth of what we see in Paul sharing with these believers in Corinth and with us this morning, this desire to please the Lord. In Philippians chapter number three, we find that Paul begins, and we'll just pick it up in verse number 10 and go down through verse number 14, and notice what he says in beginning in verse number 10, that I may know Him, that I may know Him. How well do you know God? How well do you know Him? Think about that. Paul is right in this church in Philippi. Paul had been walking with God for a long time, but he says that I may know Him. I don't want to just know about God. I want to know Him personally and intimately. I want to know Him. And he says that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being made conformable unto His death, if by any means, notice what he says, I might not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.\" This is Paul's desire. What is he trying? What is he seeking to apprehend? What is he seeking? What's the goal of his life? He says in verse 13, brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and notice, reaching forth unto those things which are before. I press, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Well, this morning we see this language that Paul uses as he's writing to the church in Philippi and he's expressing his own personal desire. I'm desiring to know Him and I'm desiring to please Him and I'm pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, ultimately so that Christ alone would receive the glory, but we find that Paul recognized that this is his desire, through all that he would do through his life, that he would please God. The book of 1 Thessalonians in chapter number four, Paul, this is where we read of Paul having this desire for others, yes, for himself, but we find in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four, he's writing to this church in Thessalonica and notice what he says to them as he's commending them and encouraging them and he's instructing them throughout this letter, but he says in verse number one of 1 Thessalonians chapter four, furthermore then we beseech you, I mean the language of this I beseech you, this begging, this earnest pleading with these believers in Thessalonica, not only does he say we beseech you, but then he says and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, notice that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more. Paul knew he was gonna stand before God personally, but Paul knew that every person that trusted Christ as their savior, that they too would stand before God personally. He says in the book of Colossians in the first chapter that he's warning them, that he might present them perfect before the Lord being complete and here as he's writing to these believers in Thessalonica, he says that you would walk in a such a way that you would please God, so you would abound more and more. Notice he says for we know, for ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. He says in verse three, for this is the will of God, even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication, why? Well, because fornication would not please God and it's specifically laid out here in verse number three, that every one of you in verse number four should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor and he begins to go through and he says in verse number seven to kind of summarize all that he's saying here, for God hath not caught us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. Remember what God said in the book of Leviticus and it's repeated by Peter in first Peter that be holy, for I am holy. God is holy and we as his people are to walk in holiness, that we are not, God has not caught us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. I'm reminded of what the truth of God's word is with regard to the grace of God, which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness, not only that, but worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. That's today, that's how I'm living my life today and what a blessing to know that God is concerned about my behavior and your behavior and we can please God and we ought to be striving to please God. In 2 Timothy chapter two, Paul is writing, we studied this book last year, 1 and 2 Timothy and he's writing in this second chapter about a good soldier and what does it mean to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ? And I preached, I think for five weeks from 2 Timothy chapter two last year and we looked at various aspects of what does it mean to be a good soldier? I don't wanna just be a soldier, I wanna be a good soldier. I don't wanna be content with just, well, it's good enough, it's status quo, no, I wanna be a good soldier of Jesus Christ. He says in 2 Timothy one, thou therefore my son endure, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou hast heard of me. Among many witnesses the same, commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that woreth and tangleth himself with the affairs of this life, notice that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. One of this morning, where's our desire? Do we truly have a desire like Paul had, that I wanna be accepted of him, that I wanna please my savior? We find that there are several verses of scripture that we could look to to understand this word, accept it again, well pleasing in the sight of God. Look at a few with me, Romans chapter number 12. We're familiar with this text of scripture and we find in Romans chapter 12 as Paul has given all such wonderful truth throughout the book of Romans and he comes to this 12th chapter and he says, therefore I beseech you, therefore, based on all of that which I've already shared with you, all of the truth that has been revealed, I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God. Notice what he says, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy. Notice what it says, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. It's your reasonable service. It is reasonable for God to have the expectation that we would live our lives for his glory, that we'd understand that as we have been saved by the grace of God, we can't earn our salvation, we can't keep our salvation, but now that I belong to Jesus, that I would, as the songwriter said, live for Jesus. Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. We see in verse one, and again in verse number two of Romans chapter 12, that word acceptable. And Paul said there in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number nine that I might be accepted, that we may be accepted of him. Well-pleasing in his sight. Ephesians 5 and verse number 10 says it this way, and it's a great verse of scripture. In fact, I think it's a verse of scripture that really should be a verse that is a filter that we use for our daily activities, for the things that we do. We should use Ephesians 5 and verse number 10 as a filter. Why do I say that? Well, notice what the Bible says in Ephesians 5 and verse number 10. Proving, proving what is acceptable unto who? What's it say? The Lord. Not proving what's acceptable to my neighbor, to my spouse, to my parent, to my children, to my church, to my pastor, to my, no, no, no. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. Why does that matter? Because that's who you're gonna stand before. That's who you're gonna stand before. And so we ought to prove. What does it mean to prove? Well, that's work, that's labor. It's labor. Many times the word proving was used within the context of metalworking, where you would prove a metal, where you would refine that process of adding the heat and the fire to take out all of that which is to be removed so that you would have the purity of that metal. And you find that here the Bible says proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. It's a simple verse of scripture. I believe that every one of us here this morning could memorize this week this verse. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. It's not a hard verse. But oh, implementing the truth of this verse into our lives is so much more challenging than simply memorizing the verse. But could I tell you this morning, it's worth it to implement the truth. Proving, how do I prove? When I look at this truth this morning in Ephesians five and verse 10, how do I prove what is acceptable unto the Lord? You know what it means? It means we gotta dig into God's word. We gotta dig in and find how. Is this activity, this behavior, this whatever I'm looking at doing, is this acceptable unto the Lord? Is he going to be pleased with it? So important. And can I tell you this morning, that if you honestly. search the Scriptures, and you're not just trying to twist the Scriptures, but if you honestly search the Scriptures, I believe that God and His Spirit will reveal to us what is acceptable to Him. And we can prove what is acceptable unto the Lord. It takes work. It takes diligence. And you'll only do it if you have the desire to be accepted of Him. Notice we find in Philippians chapter 4 and verse number 18, the Bible says this in Philippians 4 and verse number 18, as Paul is writing, and really what he's doing in this section of Philippians 4 is he's commending the believers in Philippi for their gift, a financial gift that they gave to help him, and they gave once and again. And really the context of Philippians 4 has nothing to do with tithing. It has everything to do with giving above and beyond tithing, specifically with regard to really what we would call today missions giving. And we find that here they had given, they had communicated once and again, they had given of their own resources so that Paul could fulfill the ministry that God had called him to fulfill, and he says to them in verse 18, but I have all and abound, I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you. That's the offering that I just alluded to. But notice how he describes it, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. You know what Paul's saying to these believers in Philippi? What you did there in following the will of God, following God's leadership in your life, and you communicating with me and enabling the ministry to go forward, enabling the gospel to be spread forth, that that sacrifice was acceptable and well-pleasing to God. I want my life to be acceptable and well-pleasing to God. I want God to be pleased with those things that we do, that we say, I want it for myself personally, I want it for our church corporately, that God would be pleased with us. We find in Hebrews, you don't need to turn there, but Hebrews 13 and verse number 21, the Bible says, I'll read verse 20, now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. I like that little phrase in verse 21 that says well-pleasing in His sight. You know the amazing thing? The Bible says in verse 21 that He is working in us, that it says this, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight. But you know what you have to do? You have to let Him work in you. You have to let Him work in you. He desires to work in you, He desires to work through you, He wants to work in you that which is well-pleasing, and He's ready and He's able, but we have a will, and we have to allow Him. So often we look at the life of the Apostle Paul and we may be tempted to put Paul on some type of pedestal, if you will, and we may look at Paul at some level of this great Christian, and oh, that we might be used of God like Paul was, but you know why God used Paul? Because Paul surrendered. Because Paul made himself available. Because Paul had that desire that he would be accepted of Him, and Paul made himself available. He said, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. In the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me. And just a few verses in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 15, a verse that's really my favorite Bible verse, and that He died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and rose again. Paul was used of the Lord because Paul was surrendered to the Lord. Paul desired to be that vessel that was meat for the Master's work. This morning we see this desire in 2 Corinthians 5, in the end of verse number 9, we may be accepted of Him daily as we live our lives. Do we have that desire? Do we think through the daily things that we do, do we examine them through that filter of Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, will this please my Savior? Will this please my Savior? The desire of Paul, number two this morning, the dedication of Paul. His desire to please the Lord resulted in his dedication. Can I tell you, most times in life when we think about people that have a desire for something, if they truly have a desire to achieve something, to accomplish something, to attain something, they are dedicated to whatever that thing is. If it's a true, deep-rooted desire that they have, then there's some dedication that is going to be evident in their life. You find somebody that says, well I want to do this, and they share with you the desire, but you see absolutely no evidence that would have any, give any kind of thought to your mind that they truly desire that. You say, I'm not really sure you desire that, but Paul is dedicated. Notice what he says here in verse number nine as we look at this verse of Scripture. He says, wherefore, notice these words, we labor. We labor. That whether present or absent, notice we may be accepted of Him. Why does he use this word labor? We mentioned earlier in Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, proving what is acceptable in the Lord, the work that's required in that proving process. And here in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9, he says we labor. Paul, I believe, regularly examined his life. I believe that Paul, as he writes to the church in 1 Corinthians and chapter number 11 about examining ourselves with regard to the Lord's Supper, I think that regularly in Paul's life he examined himself. He desired to know on a regular basis was he living in such a way that was pleasing to God. Turn over here to the book of Acts, in Acts chapter 24, and I want you to see what Paul says here in Acts chapter 24, and in this text of Scripture, he is giving his defense before Felix. We find that Paul, in this section of the book of Acts, he's had the opportunity to stand and to share his testimony and stood before the religious leaders of the community there, the Sanhedrin, if you will. We find that many of those religious leaders were there, and then he's going to be before Felix. We find that he will have opportunity to stand before Festus and Agrippa as well in the next several chapters, and so Paul is having this unique opportunity in this section of the book of Acts to be able to share what Christ did for him with these people. We find that in Acts 24, as Paul is going through the process here of giving his defense, if you will, before Felix, notice, if you will, in verse number 13, neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. Paul had been accused of some things, and in verse 8 it talks about how they accused him, and he says, in verse 10, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, and he says they can't prove those things, but then notice what he says. He begins in verse 14, he gives this, he says, I confess. He gives this testimony, if you will, unto Felix and those that would be there, and he says, but this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers. Notice what he says at the end of verse number 14. Believing, what's it say? All things. Not some things, not most things, not the things that I like or the things that I can kind of fit in, but he says, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets. Now what does that refer to? That refers to the Old Testament, the law and the prophets, and so we could talk about Bible preservation right here from this verse of Scripture, and how Paul believed that God's Word had been preserved, and he says, I believe all of it. He wasn't coming with a textual critic mindset of let's criticize and let's try to critique and change and so on and so forth. No, he says, I believe all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward God. That word hope is an interesting word. It's so unlike the word that is used in our vernacular today. People talk about hope today with all sorts of ideas of really the best way I could describe the most common usage that I hear is kind of a wishful thinking idea. I hope this is gonna happen. No, no, that's not, when you see the word hope in the Bible, that is not the definition. It is a confident expectation. It is having this confidence, he says, and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead. Both of the just and unjust and why is he saying this? Why is he talking about this resurrection? Well, because this motivates his living This is what plays into that desire which leads to that dedication that Paul has and we come to verse number 16 and notice what he says and Herein Do I exercise? myself You know what that word exercise means it means to labor It means to just drive What did we see over in 2nd Corinthians 5 and verse number 9? He says wherefore Wherefore we labor Right. So we find here. He says that I I Exercise myself. What is he exercising himself for in Acts 24 in verse 16? What is he laboring and striving for in this verse of Scripture notice to have always? to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and Toward men. I want you to think about this just for a moment Paul says I'm exercising myself. I'm laboring. I'm striving For what purpose Paul? Why are you exercising Paul? What is this this this effort that is going forth? Why are you dedicated to this because I want to have Always not most times but always a Conscience that is void of offense Toward God We sing the song nothing between my soul and my Savior Paul Communicates to Felix. Why why is he doing the things that he's doing? Why is he being accused of what he's being accused of? why did Paul go and preach in all of these places and and give the gospel and and tell people that Jesus is the only way why did Paul do all of this? Well, he desired to live his life in such a way that he would please his Savior He desired he exercised himself to have always listen if he's going to have always a conscience That's void of offense toward God. This exercise was regular He didn't let things just kind of build up and just kind of well We'll do this once a month once every whatever. No, this was a regular occurrence in his life. I Want to have nothing between my soul and my Savior, but then notice he ends with these words and toward men and toward men Someone has said if you're not right with your neighbor, you're not right with God If you're not right with one another you're not right with God There's some people that have this idea I'm right with God I'm concerned about my relationship with God, but I really don't care about any other relationship Paul says I desire I exercise myself to have a conscience. That's void of offense. That's always void of offense toward God and toward men Paul desired To live his life in such a way that God would be pleased with him That that he would not bring a reproach against the name of the Savior we find that earlier if you turn back just a Book or a chapter or so in your Bibles there in chapter 23 Maybe it's on the same page for you But in verse 1 of chapter 23 notice the Bible says this and Paul Earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren. I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day How could Paul make that statement Well, because then he later reveals to us. Listen, he didn't start exercising himself when he stood before Felix He had already been exercising himself to have always a conscience That's void of offense toward God and toward men And so when he stood before these religious leaders in Acts chapter 23 He says I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day Now I want you to think about the context of 2nd Corinthians and we talked about this several weeks ago as we've been studying through This chat or through this book and we found that in chapter number one. I preached a message when you're misunderstood When you're misunderstood and I said this when I preached that message. There's been a time in your life I guarantee there's been a time in your life that you have been misunderstood There's been a time in your life where you misunderstood someone else we can all relate to this And as we look at that passage of Scripture at the end of 2nd Corinthians chapter number one, we noticed how Paul Approached that situation of being misunderstood. What was the misunderstanding? Well, they were accusing Paul that hey, you said you were gonna come visit us and you didn't and so therefore you're not trustworthy and you're kind of your yay means nay and your name means yay and Paul just he's He's double-minded and so on and so forth. And that was not true But I said this when I preached that message that before Paul ever tried to explain himself. He first examined himself And how that be a good rule for us To examine ourselves before we ever try to explain ourselves. And what does he say? Well in verse number 12 of 2nd Corinthians 1 he says for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly Sincerity not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God We have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you word You know what Paul was saying in that verse of Scripture He was saying that he had examined himself and that before the Lord he was right He was right before the Lord. There was nothing that he had done. That was offensive. That was inappropriate. That was sin That was not pleasing to his God. And so he went through that process. And so why do I bring that up? Well, because he says that in verse 9 of our text this morning in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 we therefore we labor We labor this was something that was ongoing. This was something that was regular. This was a regular occurrence This was something that Paul was dedicated to whether absent or present or absent. We may be accepted of him Can I tell you this morning? There's not one of us that knows when we're gonna leave this earth None of us know The rapture could happen at any moment But death could happen in any moment David said this as he's being sought by Saul There's but a step between me and death and as I've often thought about that passage of Scripture The reality in David's life is that yes Saul was hunting him I mean Saul had made David his enemy continually and he had his Choices men and he was seeking after and he sought to kill David and yes There was but a step between him and death, but you know for each of us. There's about a step between us and death. I Shared some with some of the folks that were here for visitation yesterday morning we're driving home late on Friday evening and we're driving home and We're on 95 and we come around this corner and you could see not much more than maybe a quarter mile ahead of us It was coming in the opposite direction But you could see a car that was on fire that I'm telling you the flames had to be 15 20 feet out of that car Just an inferno There was no accident. I have no idea what happened. We're going on our way So you can't really you know, you're not stopping and checking it out But the reality is that that thing was just up in flames, but there was no accident It's not like there was a crash that reason I have no idea what happened but what I know is or what I assume is That that person didn't get in their car that evening to travel down 95 south and think that their car was gonna catch on fire In that manner. I don't think they thought that was gonna happen How many people we read? I mean look think about recent things that have been in our backyard a Plane going to land at Reagan National. How many of you have flown into Reagan National before? How many of you been on an airplane before How many of you bought a ticket after you or you said maybe I'm not gonna buy a ticket right 135 or whatever the number was people in that plane if you've flown into Reagan before and I have many times When you're flying into Reagan, what do I do? I see the Potomac We're getting close Am I am I telling the truth if you've landed in Reagan you're flying in there. You can see it. You know, the approach is there. I Can't even hardly imagine that But that's how frail our lives are That's the frailty of life And So why does Paul say I'm laboring? Why does he say I'm striving? Why does he say that that I'm exercising myself because in any moment you can meet the Lord And Is your life well pleasing? to God is my life well pleasing to God Speaking with regard to the the rapture and again We know that that could happen at any time if you read the book of 1st John and you end the second chapter and you enter into the third chapter and in those few verses of Scripture It's very clear that he's speaking about the the Lord Jesus Christ coming back and he says at the end of chapter number two That we would not be ashamed of him at his appearing But the reality is that you don't know when he's going going to appear, because it says, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Is that not what the Bible says? As a thief in the night, listen, the reality is that Jesus is not going to send you a two-minute warning, a two-week warning. He's not going to say, hey, listen, get your life straightened up because I'm coming back next Tuesday. No, no, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Is that not what the Bible teaches? So why is Paul so concerned about this thing? Why is Paul living his life in the manner in which he is, this desire of being accepted of him has just led to a dedication in his life that I'm laboring, I'm striving, I'm exercising. Why? Because I want God to be pleased with my life. And this morning, every believer in Corinth and every believer throughout the church age that has read this portion of Scripture should have the same desire, should have the same desire, I want to please my Savior. How often do we examine our lives to truly determine if God is pleased? My thoughts. God knows your thoughts. You can hide your thoughts for a period of time. You can hide your thoughts from other people. Why do I say for a period of time? Because your thoughts eventually are going to become your actions. But for a period of time, your thoughts can be hidden from other people, but God knows them. God knows what you're thinking. Do you remember when Jesus stood there and as He's ministering and those people are reasoning amongst themselves and He says, why do you think this in your heart? Can you imagine how they must have thought at that moment? How do you know what I'm thinking? You ever look at your spouse and you kind of can just see and you say, I know what you're thinking. You might be wrong when you say, I know what you're thinking. But God knows exactly what we're thinking. We think about my thoughts being pleasing to God, my words being pleasing to God. My actions. Thoughts lead to words, lead to actions. In this age in which we live, I wonder this morning if my electronic communication is pleasing to God. The text that I send, the emails that I send, the whatever social media posts. Listen, sometimes people just throw stuff out there and they think that it doesn't really matter. Listen, is it pleasing to God? Is God pleased with it? My online activity. No one's ever going to know. Can I give you a newsflash? So many people know. They can get your device, they can track your IP, they know what you're doing. You think you're hiding something. It's like Rachel when she hid those images in the tent. You know who didn't know? Jacob. You know why I think he didn't know? Because he said to Laban, whoever you find them with, let them die. Do you think he would have said that if he…no. But God knew what was in the tent because years later Moses wrote about it. God knew. I've hidden this, I've…no, no. God knows. And the question this morning, is it well-pleasing to God? Not is it well-pleasing to my parents and I'm sure that if it were your parents they wouldn't be well-pleased. Not is it well-pleasing to my spouse, I'm sure if they knew they wouldn't be pleased. I'm saying God knows. And is it well-pleasing to God? The places that I go, the entertainment that I choose, the…listen, the list could go on and on and on this morning. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. Paul says, wherefore we labor. Paul knew he was going to heaven. There's no doubt about that whatsoever. Paul knew that as he's writing to these believers in Corinth that they too had trusted Christ as their Savior because he speaks in the plural sense. We know, we have this confidence. It's not a matter of whether I'm going to go to heaven. It's not a matter of whether I'm going to lose my salvation. You can't. You're secure in the hand of God. We talked about this very truth even from the text last Sunday morning that he's given to us the earnest of the Spirit in verse number 5. I have an inheritance. I'm secure in the hand of God. But he says, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him. And I hope this morning that from a single verse of Scripture that we can have that same level of desire that Paul communicates. I want to be accepted of him. I want to be well-pleasing in his sight. How can I please him? He's given us a Bible and he's told us how we can please him. Have you ever felt like I don't know how to please somebody? Maybe it's a boss. Yeah, you've been there. I don't know. There's nothing I can do to please him. God tells us exactly what we can do to please him. And he also tells us the things that do not please him. And so Paul says that I want to be accepted of him and therefore I'm dedicated to this. I am laboring. I am exercising. I am striving. This morning, are you striving to please your Savior? Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for your Word. We thank you for this truth in the testimony of the Apostle Paul. God, I pray that you would help us this morning to have the same desire and the same level of commitment, dedication, that we would labor, that we would strive, that we'd exercise, that we might be accepted, well-pleasing in your sight. Thank you for saving us. Lord, we know that one day we'll see you face-to-face. And as we'll examine next week, we'll stand before you to give an account at that judgment seat of Christ. God, it's our heart's desire this morning, my heart's desire this morning to be pleasing in your sight. Help us to live every day for your glory. I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd have your will in way, that we would be responsive, that we'd be doers of your Word. Well thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. And as she does, the altar is open.",
