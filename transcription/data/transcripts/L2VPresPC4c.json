  "text": "Number 11 and we've been studying through the book of Hebrews here on Sunday mornings and of course our theme for 2020 looking unto Jesus. I'm thankful that he is the author and he is the finisher of our faith Amen, and what a wonderful blessing. We've been called to run a race and as we run our race, we've been Instructed to keep our eyes upon the Lord Jesus Christ and what a blessing I've often said throughout this year of course many things that have occurred that none of us could have ever expected or Anticipated but we've often said that we can have the peace of God which passeth all understanding we can have joy and hope and All of those wonderful things why not because we have our head in the sand But because we have our eyes on our Savior, amen, and we serve a great God He is the Lord God omnipotent and he does reign Amen and we had the opportunity yesterday to do a little kayaking and what a joy to see the beauty of God's creation and Just to be able to just sit in amazement of his handiwork. Amen, and what a blessing We're so thankful for all that God has done for us. We begin our journey this morning through Hebrews chapter 11 I believe that we could spend months going through this particular chapter We don't have months to go through Hebrews chapter 11 if we're going to finish in 2020 my plan is to preach five messages from this passage of scripture from Hebrews 11 I will not say over the next five weeks because next week is revival meeting I will not be preaching from the book of Hebrews, but we will be having a special message next Sunday morning and so for five messages I plan to go through the book or the 11th chapter here of the book of Hebrews and if we're able to do that It should keep us on schedule for being able to can complete the book of Hebrews here in 2020 it is interesting as we begin chapter number 11. The Bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen For by it the elders obtained a good report through faith. We Understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear If we look at these first three verses of Hebrews 11 I'm going to title the message now faith is just from verse number one there And it's interesting as we studied through the 10th chapter over the last several weeks We understood that in Hebrews 10 in verse number 22 that the recipients were instructed to let us draw near With a true heart remember this in full assurance of faith Later in the chapter. They were instructed in verse number 37 excuse me 38 now the just shall live by faith and then it's interesting as we end the Chapter the 10th chapter and you come to the latter part of verse number 39 It says but we are of them that believe to the saving of the soul We're not of them who draw back unto perdition but we're of them that believe to the saving of the soul and then the writer says now faith is And he's going to give us this great description of what faith is. And of course we understand The content of Hebrews chapter 11 if you've been around the Lord's work for any length of time you've had an understanding many throughout the years have referred to Hebrews 11 as the hall of faith chapter and Throughout the chapter. We have the opportunity to see how that Those that have gone on before us by faith what they did It's interesting. I believe that the subject matter of faith is a fascinating study In fact as you study throughout the Word of God and you study Various aspects of faith and those that exercise faith and of course Even as you consider the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and how so often as he would interact not only with his Disciples but others in whom he had the opportunity to minister to during his earthly ministry You find that he often refers to the subject matter of faith and we find that it is a fascinating study We know there are many that have lived and gone before us those in the scriptures that we could read of but even others That would be our contemporaries if you will that we would say they they lived by faith. They had great faith They believed God One of those men that some of you may be familiar with is. Dr. Lee Robertson he is with the Lord now and the Lord used brother Robertson in a great way and He had the opportunity to start a church and start a Bible College and Many people were trained for the ministry people that were scattered all throughout the world serving God in various capacities and they had 10,000 members in their church they had satellite churches all across the area in Tennessee in which they Had their church and when brother Robertson was in his 90s nearing the end of his journey here upon earth He had the opportunity to have some conversation with Clarence Sexton Clarence Sexton also pastors down in Tennessee he is still alive today and pastoring the Temple Baptist Church in Powell, Tennessee and He asked dr. Robertson this question. He said if there was one thing that you could go back and change what would it be and This man that had exercised great faith in God throughout his life and ministry said this to have more faith In God to have more faith in God It is interesting for the disciples when they were there with the Lord Jesus Christ and receiving instruction We find it in Luke 17 in verse number 5. They say to the Lord Jesus Christ. They say increase our faith We understand the Bible tells us in Romans 10 in verse number 17 So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God And we understand even as we concluded last week that we have a Responsibility as the people of God to live by faith that reference that we found at the end of Hebrews chapter number 10 That is contained not only here in the book of Hebrews But we find also in the book of Romans in the book of Galatians that quote from the prophet Habakkuk The just shall live by faith And we understand the importance of this subject matter And as we begin looking at this 11th chapter these first three verses give us a good foundation To have a proper understanding of all that will be discussed in this chapter notice with me if you're taking notes first of all faith explained Faith explained now there are some in our world today that have a misunderstanding of what faith is Not only are there some in our world today that have a misunderstanding of what faith is But I believe there are some even of the household of faith that have a misunderstanding of what faith is and so we find that here in the scriptures that God is giving us and the people that have just been instructed these Recipients that have been told how superior our God is and how Christ is better than the angels. He's better than the prophets He's better than Moses. He's better than Abraham He's better than the the the Levitical the Aaronic priesthood and he's so much greater He's far superior and then they're told to live by faith and then faith is explained to them even before we see the Expression of faith through all of those that would be referenced in Hebrews chapter 11 By the way, many of these folks that were referenced in Hebrews chapter 11. We have a good understanding If we've been around church, we've been around the Bible for any length of time We have a good understanding of many of these characters that are referenced how much greater understanding these Jewish believers would have had of these people that are referenced in Hebrews chapter number 11 and We find that here as faith is explained. He says now faith is notice this word substance faith is the Substance of things hoped for the interesting aspect as we look at this word Substances it is that which rest upon fact That which rest upon fact, it's not a theory. It's not a hypothesis when we think about Substance he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for we would gather from that Descriptive term substance that it results in us having a level of confidence and assurance It is that which provides for us as the people of God that firm foundation and he says that faith is Substance it is the substance of things hoped for but then he uses this term He says it is the evidence of things not seen So we see two descriptive terms here substance of things hoped for Evidence of things not seen that word evidence. It's interesting. It is a word that would be used and That which is accepted for conviction Now we understand we have in our minds even we think about that Word evidence and thinking about that which would be accepted for conviction We'd have our minds maybe in a court of law and understanding charges that have been brought against Somebody and as those charges are brought against an individual there has to be evidence in order to have a conviction If there's no evidence if the evidence is not there if it's not provided It's not likely that you're going to get the conviction And so we find that he says that it is the substance of things hope for that which rest upon facts It is not a theory. It's not a hypothesis. It results in us as the people of God having confidence and assurance It's that firm foundation, but it's also that evidence That proof if you will Now you understand this morning that every day We do certain things by faith. In In fact, I would argue this morning that every person that walks upon the face of this earth exercises faith When they get into an automobile they exercise faith and those particular Elements that were used to construct that vehicle when they walk into a building when you cross a bridge You're exercising faith and the person that designed that That bridge the architects that designed it the the people that have not only built the bridge, but the materials in which the bridge is made of Now we don't think about it that way though, right? Most of us we just go ahead and drive right over the bridge. I think about ladders So it's a good illustration of faith. You've got to get on the ladder I remember Ed and Jackie over in the fellowship hall and Ed might remember this a number of years ago It was right after we had gotten here and it's probably about eight and a half years ago and we were doing a project here and Ed brought a ladder and The ladder that Ed brought must have been his father's it was in old old shape I mean it was not looking so good and I weigh a few more pounds than Ed does and Ed says, oh, it's good I said, how about I hold it for you? Amen I didn't have any faith in that ladder That it was going to support me that I could climb up on it. And so I Acknowledged the situation I looked at and I said no, I'm not going to step on that ladder. I didn't trust it I didn't have faith that I could stand upon that ladder and we think about faith It's action as we go throughout the book of the 11th chapter the book of Hebrews over the next several weeks We'll find that faith results in action, but we see that it's this substance. It's this evidence I've often said throughout the years that a simple definition of faith is this Taking God at his word Taking God at his word The question really comes down to this. Do we believe what God said? Many years ago when I worked in the corporate world and I was dealing with a very high-profile project and I worked in the The procurement department we had a very very important project that was coming up Customers were coming in to take delivery of a 50 million dollar aircraft and they had the potential of purchasing more aircraft it was a very very serious situation and we were missing some parts and It was absolutely critical that those parts arrived tomorrow And I remember the particular vendor that I was working with on that project was a vendor out in California and I was contacting them regularly and I was trying to get that tracking number so that I could have some type of Just proof if you will that it was actually shipping. It was going to arrive And I remember as I spoke with that man late in the day Still no tracking number available. He says you just have to have faith man And I said, I don't have any faith in you All right, and I want I want to have a tracking number. I want to have some see but God's given us this book We're taking God at his word We're saying I'm believing what God says see when that individual finally provided me with a tracking number number I had a certain level of confidence that we were going to get the items that we needed Why because I had something other than his word. I wasn't trusting his word See, we have the God of the universe who's given us this precious book That's been preserved for us that people throughout the ages Have fought to defend and to deliver to a next generation and it is the source of our faith and this morning We think about faith we say That we take God at his word It's the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen I have absolute assurance That God will do what he said. He will do He always has he always will amen This morning. We're familiar with the bumper sticker. That was very popular years ago I've not seen it often in recent years where the bumper sticker would say God said it I believe it that settles it. I've often said that it doesn't matter if you believe it or not if God said it that settles it. Amen You believing it or not believing it will not change the truth. We can't change truth truth is truth We find that the Apostle Paul said this in 2nd Timothy chapter number 1 in verse number 12 He says for the witch cause I also saw suffer these things nevertheless I am NOT ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am Persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him Against that day. I want you to think about that word persuaded keep in your mind just for a moment Maybe write it in your notes. I want you to Reference back to that in just a moment. Paul says this in Acts 27 in verse number 25 And it's a great declaration in the midst of a terrible storm and all sorts of Danger that is imminent and they were not sure that they would survive in the angel The Lord came and spoke to to Paul and Paul says this in Acts 27 in verse number 25 He says wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I Believe God. What does he say that it shall be? Even as it was told me Notice that word believe he used the word persuaded in 2nd Timothy 1 in verse number 12 He uses the word believe in Acts 27 in verse number 25 It's interesting that Hebrews 1039 when he says that we are of them that believe is that same word that we saw? That we're referencing here. But the thing that's interesting is that the word persuaded and the word believe they are not the same word Obviously, they are synonymous one with another but the interesting thing is you dig in and begin to study is that both of those words? Have the same root word and it is the root word that is translated believe in Hebrews 1039 But is the root word that is translated almost 240 times in our English New Testament faith What is faith it's being persuaded What is faith it's believing Think about Paul in that situation in Acts 27 in verse number 25 if you're familiar with go with what's going on in Acts 27 Paul had actually told them not to set sail But yet they went and they sailed anyway, they get in the midst of your Euclidean and all that storm They did not see stars for days. And I mean they were fearful for their lives and these are professionals We Find that the Lord allowed for the Angel of God to come and to speak to Paul and he says in the midst there's 276 people on that ship and He says I believe God. Can you see the confidence of Paul? Standing up. I mean in the midst of all of that turmoil in the midst of that storm It's raging and the people they're they're concerned for their lives and he stands up with Confidence in faith believing Why because God said it it's gonna be as he said I believe God a word that we often use that would be helpful for us to understand what this Explanation of faith is that of trust? Trusting God I Believe this this morning that each of us could say similar to what the disciples said in Luke 17 increase our faith increase our faith If you want your faith to be increased you must get into the Word of God Not only must you get into the Word of God, but you must exercise faith many have likened faith to a muscle and As you exercise faith and you see God do what only God can do and you prove him you take him at his word And you see God what man how that increases your faith you think about the disciples and as they Journeyed along the the road with the Lord Jesus Christ and and you find that many times they saw great miracles But then they face some type of difficulty and he says how is it that you do not understand? How is it that you do not remember? What were all of those things? They were faith builders Jesus was demonstrating his power and he was showing them what he was able to do and in our lives this morning God has demonstrated his power and he's allowed us to see some wonderful things that would cause our faith to be increased We see the Fact that faith is explained notice number two faith is exercised We look at these next two verses. I want you to notice in verse number two It really is a summary verse. It says for by it the elders Obtained a good report For by it by what by faith We understand that verse number six says but without faith it is impossible to please Him. For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\" Those who have gone before us, those that are referenced in Hebrews 11, and obviously many more as you get down to the end, you find that he begins to just very broadly describe some folks that have gone before us. Some are mentioned by name, but then some are just kind of referenced as to some of the events that took place that transpired in their lifetime. And he says, those that have gone before us, by it, thy faith, the elders, those that have gone before us, look what it says. They obtained a good report. Their testimony of faith. I believe this morning that we could say appropriately from what we understand in Hebrews 11, that they pleased the Lord and they received His approval. That's the idea of obtaining a good report is to have the approval of. And we see here that these that have gone before us, why? Because they live by it, by faith. See, God has designed it so that His people are to live by faith. Not by sight. Many times, we prefer to live by sight. God, just show me how you're going to do it and then I'll jump in. God says, I want you to believe Me. I want you to believe that I'll do it. And see, when we think about faith, we must understand that as I mentioned in the first point this morning, what faith is, that the object of our faith is of great importance. The object of our faith is the Lord Jesus Christ. God Himself. The Word of God. And because He is the object of our faith, and it's not that blind faith that we're just kind of taking a step and just blindly... no, no. We're trusting what God has said. That God will not fail us. That God will do what He said He will do. That He's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. And we find here that these that will be mentioned later throughout Hebrews 11, that these, they exercise faith and because of their exercising of faith, they receive the approval of God, they please the Lord. This morning, I don't think any of us would say, well, I'm not interested in pleasing God. That would be a really foolish thing to say, don't you agree? I believe this morning that if we were to one by one go around, if we had some means of speaking to each individual that's watching via live stream this morning, and we were able to contact each one individually and say, do you want to please God? I think that we'd have a very high percentage, if not 100%, I mean way up there that would answer, yes, I want to please God. Live by faith. Because without it, it's impossible to please Him. And the elders that are referenced here in verse number two that will have the opportunity to see a sampling that will follow throughout the remainder of the chapter, they lived by faith and thus pleased God and obtained His approval. I want you to notice in verse number three, a very interesting verse. The Bible says, through faith, what's that next word? We. Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. The reason why I believe that this is of interest is because the majority of the text of Scripture that is before us references individuals by name who exercise faith. By faith, right? We go through it and we can see that by faith, Abel, in verse four. By faith, Enoch, in verse number five. By faith, Noah. By faith, Abraham. By faith, Sarah. I mean, you go through the passage and you see all of these individuals, but in verse number three, it says, through faith, we understand. There was an understanding that the writer of Hebrews is expressing to the recipients and including the recipients in this very truth that is before us in verse number three. There was an understanding that they had and the understanding that they had was with regard to creation. Now, I understand that verse number three, there are some that will say, well, the word worlds doesn't really mean universe or creation. It means ages or eternity. The fact of the matter is that the word that is used there, worlds, can and does, in some references, refer to ages and eternity, but it also refers to the universe. And how is it that we determine what it is that is being referenced is through the context of what we find in the Word of God. We interpret Scripture contextually. And as we understand the proper interpretation of Scripture, I believe this morning that it is abundantly clear that what is in view here is that of creation. Notice what he says. Through faith, we, again, using that plural sense of including the recipients of the book of Hebrews, we understand something. What is it that we understand? We understand the worlds were framed by the Word of God. The worlds were framed by the Word of God. You understand this morning, if you were to read Genesis chapter number one, that you'll see this phrase repeated, God said, God said, and it was done. God said, and it was done. And you see it repeated through Genesis chapter number one, and you have the understanding that as you read through Genesis chapter number one that God has spoken all things into existence. It's interesting if you turn over to the book of Psalms and look, if you will, very quickly at Psalm 32 and notice what is said here, excuse me, Psalm 33. And I want you to notice what the Lord gives us here in this particular passage of Scripture with regard to the creation. Again, I mentioned already that in Genesis chapter number one and when we studied this weeks, months ago, through our study of the book of Genesis, I referenced, if you were here as part of that study, I encourage you to underline where it says, God said, and then underline where it says, it was so. Because God said, and it happened. Here in Psalm 33, notice what the Bible says in verse number one, rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous, for praise is comely for the upright. He's speaking about praising and worshiping the Lord and how appropriate that is. Skip down and look at verse number five. He loveth righteousness and judgment. The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made. And all the host of them, by the breath of his mouth, he gathereth the waters of the sea together as in heap. He layeth up the depth in storehouses. Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. Notice verse number nine, for he spake and it was done. He commanded and it stood fast. Isn't that awesome? That's our God. He is the Creator. We understand this morning that the subject matter of creation is under great attack. We understand this morning that our school systems have introduced for generations now other theories with regard to the origin of mankind and the origin of the universe. I read a study not long ago where they changed the timing of the age of the earth and they had discrepancies between the two groups of people that were acknowledging the ages and the different things that they did in order to determine and they were different by billions of years and I'm like, man, we're only talking about thousands of years that it even existed, amen? But the reality is that what we have to understand is that even in their understanding, even in what they would propagate of evolution or whatever it is that they would begin to teach, that they are also exercising some level of faith in that. They're exercising faith. I'd much rather exercise faith than the one that was there that told us what he did, amen? He said, here's how it happened, here's what I did. I said and it was so. That's the power of God. See, here's the thing that we must understand that when a professor, a school teacher, no matter what year of schooling they're teaching, no matter where they find themselves, those that would profess to be scientists, when they begin to teach on the subject matter of creation or evolution, they become a philosopher more than a professor and they're really beginning to try to give their perspective, their ideologies and all of that and you understand in Romans chapter number one that the whole of the matter is that they do not want to acknowledge that there's a God. Because if you acknowledge there's an existence of God, then you become accountable to God. So what do we do? What do they do? Not what do we do, what do they do? They want to remove God. Because if they can remove God, then they are not accountable. You're accountable. Can I tell you this morning? They can try to remove God until the stars fall or whatever expression you want to use. You're never going to do it. And you still are accountable. Amen? I told someone recently as I referenced the truth in Philippians 3 where the Word of God says that every tongue shall confess. Right? Every knee is going to bow. Every tongue is going to confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God. And I said to the individual, it's not a matter of if. It will happen. It's a matter of when. And when makes all the difference. This side of death, you confess that Jesus is Lord and your eternal destiny will be heaven. You acknowledge that Jesus is the Son of God. That He is the only Savior. That He bled and died to pay for your sin because you could not pay for it yourself. And you acknowledge that He died, He was buried, He rose in victory. And you exercise faith in that truth that He's given to us and you're born again. You're regenerated. Heaven is your home based upon the authority of the Word of God. Someone said to me recently, well, that's up to God. No, it's not up to God. What they meant was that God just arbitrarily chooses. No, no, God's given to us the truth of His Word with regard to salvation. And He said, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. He's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. No one can really know is what the person said. And I said, well, that's interesting because the Apostle Paul often said how that he had a desire to go to be with his Savior. You can look in Philippians 1. You can look as he's speaking to the church in Corinth in 2 Corinthians where he says to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. He says to the believers in Philippi, I am in a straight betwixt two, having a desire to depart to be with Christ, which is far better. For I am now ready to be offered. The time of my departure is at hand. In 2 Timothy 4. Why would a man say that if he did not have confidence in what God said? The lost man is fearful to die. But Hebrews, as we've studied early on in this book, we find that the book of Hebrews in the second chapter tells us that because Jesus destroyed and what He did on the cross of Calvary in destroying the works of the enemy, that we find that He delivered us from the fear of death. What a joy. We think about this truth of what we find in Hebrews 11 in verse 3 with regard to creation. It's under attack. And we see those that would philosophize and those that would give their ideologies. And this morning, we understand that here the writer of Hebrews is saying to these Jewish believers, through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God. We mentioned that. We saw that in Genesis 1 in Psalm 33. He spake and it was done. What a joy to understand the power of God's Word. You understand this morning that there's evidence of design everywhere in the universe. And design demands a designer. Amen? Lord willing, we're going to build a parsonage. I'm pretty confident that they're not going to come out here and deliver all the materials and set some type of TNT and blow it up and it's going to form a house. No, there are architects that have designed the house. There are particular materials that need to come. There are laborers that have skill in certain areas, and they're going to come in and they're going to do the work. A design demands a designer. I know that we typically, most of us today, we don't have old-time kind of watches with all of the intricacies of those that were watchmakers years ago. Many of us have various types of watches today. But you think about those old-time watches and all of the mechanics that were in there, and you think about the way in which someone had to design all of that. It didn't just happen. You look at the universe. And here, Hebrews is saying through faith we. It is faith that helps us to have this understanding. Remember, he says that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. And we're taking God at His Word. We're believing what God says. We look at the latter part of v. 3. It says, so that things which are seen are not made of things which do appear. What a powerful truth that is given to us here. Really, many principles of atomic physics could be discussed from the latter phrase of v. 3 here in Hebrews 11. And they're clearly in view and you begin to understand the way in which God made everything. He spoke it into existence. And at the center of it all is His energy. He's keeping it all together. We mentioned as we started studying this book back in Hebrews 1, and we began to understand how through not only the creation, but through His power, how He holds all things together. It is His power. What a joy. I want to take a journey through the Scriptures this morning and help us understand this phrase through faith we understand. And again, I believe that the Jewish believers that are being written to here are understanding the truth of creation and thus the word is used through faith. We understand this. But I want you to just go with me throughout the Scriptures. Go all the way back, if you will, to the book of Exodus 20. Now we understand, I don't think we need to go there and understand that Adam understood creation. Amen? He was created by God. He walked in the garden. I mean, we understand that Noah, no doubt, had an understanding of creation. And we look at those things and we understand those things in the book of Genesis. Look at Exodus 20, if you will. And I want to share with you that Moses understood the truth of creation. He understood that God created. In Exodus 20, in verse 11, right in the midst of the passage dealing with the Ten Commandments, the Bible says, for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Wherefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. See, we look here and we see that Moses had an understanding of creation. He had an understanding that God created all things in six days, and then he rested on the seventh day. And obviously, the model that is given here in the previous verse of Scripture is with regard to the Sabbath. And God used that creation week as a model for how the nation of Israel would understand their week and the Sabbath and so on and so forth. But we see here that Moses understood creation. Turn to the book of Job, if you will, in Job chapter number 38. And we're gonna go backwards here. We're gonna go forward and then we're gonna go backwards. I apologize for that, but go over to Job 38. And let me show you here, Job 38. We understand that as we go through the book of Job and begin to study, and the first couple of chapters dealing with all the hardship that Job endured, and then of course his miserable comforters, also known as friends, come to discuss many things with him. And then God speaks, and He speaks here in chapter 38. The Bible says this, then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. What's God revealing to Job? He's the creator. Amen? Job understood. Job had an understanding of creation. I think about David. You don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 19 and verse number one, what is David saying? The heavens declare the glory of God. The firmament showeth forth his handiwork. We've been singing our theme song for the last couple of months from Psalm 121, verses one and two. It is not a psalm that is ascribed to David, but we find it in that psalm. I will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. We find that Hezekiah turned back, if you will, to 2 Kings 19. We're familiar with the passage of Scripture and the account of what happens to Judah during this particular time. And the Assyrians had already taken captive Israel, the world power at that time, Assyria, and all that they're doing and all the lands and people that they're conquering. And they come to Judah, and Hezekiah is the king of Judah. Hezekiah was a good king. They'd experienced revival, and we find that Hezekiah here in 2 Kings 19 after Sennacherib sends Rabshakeh and all that happens and all that is threatened, we find that the Bible tells us that Hezekiah prays. And I want you to notice what Hezekiah prayed in 2 Kings 19 and verse 15. And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said, O Lord God of Israel, which made heaven and earth, which made heaven and earth, which made heaven and earth, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made heaven and earth.\" Hezekiah understood that God's the Creator. Look over in the book of Jeremiah, if you will. Jeremiah is just a little bit after Hezekiah from a timeline perspective and all that's taking place. We now know in Jeremiah 32, we understand here in Jeremiah that the Babylonians are now besieging. They've laid their troops against the nation of Judah. And we find that Jeremiah in fact could look out and he could see the Babylonians that are gathered together. And God had told Jeremiah and Jeremiah had faithfully prophesied that the Babylonians are going to take you captive. It's interesting that the king did not believe and yet the king came back and said, is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah's like, yeah, the same thing I've been telling you. Here's what's going to happen. Jeremiah's told something interesting in Jeremiah 32. He's told to buy the field. We don't have time to get into all of it. It's a fascinating study. I preached on it several years ago. But you look at Jeremiah 32 and you see that he's instructed to buy the field, yet the nation of Judah is getting ready to be carried into captivity. And God tells him to buy the field and we find that he does. He takes the evidence and he does all of the things the way that he's supposed to. And we come to the prayer of Jeremiah. It says in v. 16, now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Barak the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord saying, O Lord God, behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for Thee. Jeremiah understood that God's the Creator. We're taking a quick sampling here. We've seen Moses. We've seen Job. We've seen David. We've seen Hezekiah. We've now seen Jeremiah. Turn to the New Testament if you will. I want to use the example of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of course, He knows the truth of creation because He's there. He's the Creator. Amen? And Matthew 19, notice what He says. Certainly, there are many references we could look to. We're just going to look at this one this morning. Here in Matthew 19 in verses four through six, He's dealing with a subject matter where He's being questioned. Of course, many times when the religious leaders of the day would come to question the Lord Jesus Christ, they weren't really coming to question Him because they wanted to gain knowledge or understanding. They were coming to question the Lord Jesus Christ because they were trying to catch Him and they were trying to accuse Him. And they were coming with the wrong motives. And here in Matthew 19, we find that Jesus is answering. I'm going to pick it up right in verse 4. It says that He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read that He which made them... When? At the beginning. He's the Creator. Right? He made them at the beginning, made them male and female, and said, for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they say are no more twain, but one flesh. Therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. Who is He referencing when He's speaking here in these verses of Scripture? He's speaking about Adam and Eve, right? If you go back and you read in Genesis and you read the account in chapters 1 and 2, you'll read that exactly what the Lord Jesus Christ is saying in verse 5. In fact, in Genesis 2 and verse 24, it's almost an exact quote. And He says, have ye not read that He which made them in the beginning. And so this not only helps us to see the creation, but helps us to see that Adam and Eve, that's the beginning of creation. There's not these long periods of time. And He says that He made them in the beginning. Notice not only this truth, but turn over to the book of Acts, if you will, chapter number four, look at the testimony of the disciples. We referenced part of this passage two Wednesday nights ago and dealt with the subject matter of that they had been with Jesus. And after they had gone through the process of standing before the religious leaders of the day and Peter boldly proclaiming the truth, and they were just given instruction that they're no longer allowed to speak in the name of the Lord, so on and so forth. And we find that as Peter and John left, they were let go according to verse number 23, that they went to their own company. And so we see that they're gathered together again. And I want you to see what they do, how they respond to the hardship that they had endured, to the threats that they had received. We find that in verse number 24, it says, when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God. They began to pray. Oh, there's such an importance that we find throughout the word of God on prayer. It says that they began to pray with one voice. It says that lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, look at what they said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is. The disciples believed in creation. Paul in Acts 17, he's speaking to these that were in Athens, a city that is described as being wholly given to idolatry. Paul begins to stand up in the midst of Mars Hill and begins to preach a message and he says that he's going to make known the Lord God Jehovah to them. See, because they had this altar that as he passed by, it had this inscription to the unknown God. And he says, Him declare I unto you. And notice the first thing that he says in Acts 17 and verse number 24, God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Why do we take the time to go through all of these references this morning? Because the writer of Hebrews, as we begin this understanding of this subject matter of faith, he not only explains what faith is, but then he shows how faith is exercised. He's going to give us a sampling of a whole host of those that have gone before us in the next several verses of Scripture here in Hebrews 11, and we're going to see how they exercise faith in what God did. But he says in verse number 3, through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. As I mentioned as we studied the book of Genesis, the book of Genesis is foundational. It's of great importance. It's under significant attack today. There are many that would like to attack the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis and really just tear down the idea of creation. And the problem is that if you can't believe what God said in the first 11 chapters of Genesis, how can you believe what God said anywhere else? And really, that's the motive of these individuals that are attacking those 11 chapters is they're seeking to destroy the foundation and thus destroy the whole. That's what they want to do. But we find that the subject matter of creation is not simply contained within the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis. The subject matter of creation is found throughout the whole of Scripture. And there are many that have gone before us, and I believe that these Jewish believers that this book is written to originally, that they had the same understanding that God is the Creator. And we believe that through faith. This morning, now faith is. We see it explained. Understand this morning that it's the substance. It's that proof. The evidence. It's the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen. It gives us a confidence and assurance. We find that it's by faith that we please God and we receive His approval, for by it, verse 2, the elders obtained a good report. It's through faith that we believe that God is the Creator and that as we find it in the latter part of the verse, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear, and how God has created all things and He's still continuing to sustain all things to this very day. As we study the rest of chapter 11, we're going to see how people exercised faith. We see it briefly in two verses. Kind of a summary of the whole, if you will. Then we're going to track individuals. We're going to see how they lived by faith. This morning, as we embark our journey on Hebrews chapter 11, and again, many of us are familiar with the passage, with this great chapter, I wonder this morning, if someone were to write about your life, if God were to write about your life, what would He say that you did by faith? What would He say that you did by faith? Because as we study through Hebrews chapter 11, we're going to see that there's a group of people that believed God. And I find as I look throughout the Scriptures and I begin to see the significance of verse number 3 right at the front of all of Hebrews chapter 11, how important that it is that we understand through faith that He is the Creator. And if we have that faith, if we understand that, truth by faith how it will impact and influence the the other areas of our lives listen if God is the creator of all things and he is no doubt the disciples went to God in prayer the way they did in Acts chapter 4 no doubt has a kaya prayed to the Lord God creator in 2nd Kings 19 the way that he did because he understood these as a creator if God spoke all of these things into existence this army of the Assyrians is no problem for you God since God created all things the threat of the Sanhedrin the religious leaders of the day was no problem for God to deal with this morning we still are numbered with those that believe that God is the creator and I'm so thankful that he's given us that truth now faith is and as we go throughout the remainder of chapter 11 will be challenged to see how the people of God exercise faith be challenged in our own lives how are we exercising faith it boils down to this do we believe God do we believe God because faith is very simply stated taking God at his word father we love you we thank you for loving us we thank you for the privilege of being able to study thy word this morning as we've looked at these few verses of scripture we've been encouraged to understand how that these believers have been instructed in previous verses of having that full assurance of faith of living by faith of being numbered with those that believe the saving of the soul now faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen we thank you that you've given us your word we thank you that you are the Lord God Almighty that you're the creator of all things I pray this morning that even as we've examined these few chapter these few verses of scripture and these various references throughout your word I pray that our faith has been increased even this morning through the hearing of thy word I pray father that you would help us to live by faith as we begin to study the lives of those that are recorded in Hebrews 11 and were challenged by their testimony and their exercising of faith God would you help us to live by faith understanding without faith it's impossible to please you I pray God that you would move and work as only you can in the hearts of your people during this time of invitation will thank you for the work that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray would you stand with me heads are bowed eyes are closed Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano as she plays the altar is open you can make your pew there an altar we want to give the Lord opportunity to work in our hearts and lives thank him this morning commit that you're gonna believe him this morning as Kimberly plays the altar is open",
