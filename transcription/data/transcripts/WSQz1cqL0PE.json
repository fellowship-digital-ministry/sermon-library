  "text": "in this wonderful book, the book of Genesis. 50 chapters, and it's been a long time. This is message number 103. I mentioned that during the morning service today. 103 messages through this book, and some of them were multiple part messages based upon just the content of what we were dealing with. But of course, as we've mentioned throughout the study, the series over these number of years, that the book of Genesis is so foundational. It is so important. We find that in our world today, that really the content of the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis is regularly under attack. And it's regularly under attack because if the enemy can cause the individual to doubt the record of Genesis one through 11, then the reality is that the enemy can get anybody to doubt any portion of God's word. If he is not the creator, then how do we know he's really the redeemer? And really, that's the path that they go down in trying to cause doubt and uncertainty with the Genesis record. I'm thankful that the creator God gave us this wonderful book of beginnings, and it begins in the beginning God. What a wonderful book, what a wonderful content. And then of course now we end with the life of Joseph. I've titled the message, So Joseph Died. And as we begin to look at this passage of scripture, the Bible tells us in verse 22, and Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house, and Joseph lived in 110 years. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children also of Mekir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die, and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land, and to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. I wanna remind you if you wanna take and turn over quickly, but you don't need to, but in Psalm 116, God gives us a precious verse of scripture. In Psalm 116, it's a verse that we often will turn to at the time of a loved one that departs, enters into eternity. The Bible says in Psalm 116, in verse number 15, precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. As we begin to think about this portion of scripture and ending the book of Genesis, we find that for the majority of the last 13 chapters of the book of Genesis, we have traced the steps of the life of Joseph. He comes on the scene in chapter 37. We're introduced to this exemplary Bible character. He's 17 years old in Genesis chapter 37 when he comes on the scene. We find that the Bible would record for us many aspects of his life, and as we come here to Genesis chapter number 50, we're told that Joseph is 110 years old. It's very interesting because the text of scripture that I read to you beginning in verse 22 this evening and through the end of the chapter, really this portion of scripture covers about 53 or 54 years of Joseph's life. Joseph's dad died, Jacob. We read of that and we studied that the last couple of messages in the end of chapter 49 and the beginning of chapter number 50, but we find that from the death of Jacob until the death of Joseph, it's about 54 years that passes, and we find that there's really not much that's given to us with regard to the life of Joseph during those 54 years. But I think about the content that is given to us with the life of Joseph. As we begin to think about his life and we begin to think about the example that he is, and of course, many of you know, I've said it over the years, that Joseph is my favorite Bible character, and thus, when God blessed us with a son, we named him Joseph, and the reality is that when you study the life of Joseph, it's an amazing account, a record that God gives us of a life that is well-lived, a life that is exemplary, a life that is marked by several things. In fact, we're gonna look at those things this evening. It is a life that as you look at the record that God provides, there's really no sin that's mentioned. It doesn't mean that Joseph was sinless, it's just not recorded for us. There are many Bible characters that you can go to and you can study their lives and you can see the content of the life that's recorded and the blessings and the great triumphs in their life, but then also troubles and difficulties and sin and what have you, but here in the life of Joseph, though many difficulties are recorded, we don't read of any sin in the life of Joseph. He was a man that walked with God. He was a man, I believe, that pleased God. He was a man that lived a life that had no doubt a major impact amongst those that he came in contact with. I wonder this evening as we, even at the very beginning of the message tonight, we're gonna look at four things about the life of Joseph. I wonder this evening if my life, if your life had this kind of record provided and for generations of people to be able to examine and to read your life story, what would people walk away with? What would they summarize? How would they summarize your life if they were to read as we have the opportunity to read of the life of Joseph as it's recorded for us by God in his precious word? What is it that we summarize? How is it that we conclude? What is it that we learn? And I wonder tonight if our lives were under the microscope in that fashion, what would people say of you? What would people say of me? I have four thoughts for you this evening that I hope would be a blessing, things that mark the life of Joseph. And as we look at his life and we find that we come here to the end and we see his death recorded for us, I'd like to say this, number one, that Joseph's life was a life marked by obedience. His life was a life marked by obedience. By the way, God expects obedience from his children. Not only does God expect obedience, but I would say it this way, God deserves obedience, amen? It is appropriate for our God to expect that we as his people would obey him. It's a honorable thing for us as the people of God to take the truth that God has given to us and to live it, to obey it, to practice what God says, to be doers of the word and not hearers only. When I think about this life being a life marked by obedience, I would say first and foremost that Joseph learned to obey God. He learned to obey God. By the way, that's the most important thing that any of us could learn is learning to obey God. That we just determine we're gonna obey God, that we're not gonna live a life of rebellion, we're not gonna live a life in distance from what God has said for us to do, that we're simply going to live a life of obedience, that we're gonna determine that with God's help and by God's grace, we're going to obey. You know, it's very interesting, all of us can obey. Not all of us can do the same thing. Not all of us can, Lydia was in here playing the piano before church tonight and I said, Lydia, have you ever heard me play the piano? And she kind of looked at me sideways, like, what are you talking about, you play the piano? I said, oh yeah, I got a couple songs and I came over here and I played a couple of partial songs that I know just a few notes of, right? And I was just kind of messing with Lydia a little bit, but the reality is I don't play the piano. But I can obey God, even though I don't play the piano. See, there's things sometimes we begin to look at, well, I can't do this or I can't do that, but all of us can obey and God gives us the strength and the capacity to obey His commands. God never gives us instruction that He does not give us the ability to obey, amen? He enables us, it is His enabling. I preached this on Wednesday evening there from the book of 1 Thessalonians, you look at all of that instruction, how could I ever do this? You can't, but faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. And He works in us and through us and He enables us and we find that as we look at the life of Joseph, that his life is marked by obedience. Yes, first and foremost to the Lord, I see it in his life that he was obedient to his dad. His dad sent him on errands, his dad gave him responsibility and yet we find that even in his life, he obeyed that instruction. I believe that he was obedient, don't specifically call it out in this fashion, but I believe that he was obedient to those who were in authority over him. I think that when he was in Potiphar's house, that he was obedient, he made himself subject to the authority that was over him. I believe that was in prison. Why is it that he came to the position that he came to? I believe that he was an obedient individual because ultimately he understood that he was obeying the Lord, he was obeying the Lord. You know, we all have people in authority over us. There are people that say, I can't wait until I can get to a place of authority and nobody is gonna tell me what to do. I remember I was in Bible college. Sometimes Bible colleges are known for a bunch of rules and I found this out in life that every rule is there for a reason. The most crazy rule you can think of in a rule book, there's somebody that did something somewhere along the way that resulted in that rule being put in the rule book. This is how it works. And sometimes you can let your mind wander and you can wonder, I wonder where this rule came from, right, I wonder what some knucklehead did that came up with this rule being put in place. And I remember in Bible college, there's one young man and he said, I'm tired of all these rules. I'm tired of people telling me what to do. I'm going to the Marine Corps. He was about 19 years old. My whole life, I feel like I grew up in the Marine Corps because I was born and my dad was a Marine. I went to college, my dad's a Marine. He didn't retire until my middle of my freshman year in college. And he said, I'm going to the Marines. And I was like, good luck with that, man. So much for I don't have to do what anyone tells me to do, right? The reality is that obedience is a good trait of God's people. We're obedient, we're obedient. Turn to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 15, if you will. It's a portion of scripture that's familiar to many of us. In 1 Samuel 15, we read of Saul and his partial obedience. And you've often heard me say that partial obedience is really nothing more than disobedience. The command that was given from the Lord through Samuel to Saul was very plain and very clear. And yet we find that Saul did not obey the command that had been given to him. Samuel comes on the scene and Samuel is aware of the disobedience, not only because of the word of the Lord, but because of what he could hear and observe himself. He knew of the disobedience of Saul. And I just wanna draw your attention, we're not gonna read the entirety of the text or even much of it, just a verse of scripture. Notice in verse 22, the Bible says, and Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices. Why is it that Samuel says that? Well, because Saul tries to excuse his disobedience by saying we're gonna make an offering, we're gonna make a sacrifice. And so I'm gonna justify my disobedience by saying that I'm making a sacrifice. Listen, there's no justification for disobedience. The proper response to disobedience is confession. That's the proper response, confession. God, I disobeyed, I sinned and we confess and we forsake. He continues and says, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams. To obey is better, to obey is better. Think about the life of Joseph, a life that's well-lived, a life that here in Genesis 50 comes to an end, 110 years old, and I believe it was a life that was marked by obedience. I wonder tonight if we were to examine our lives, if others were to examine our lives, would they say of us that our life is marked by obedience? Is it clear in our lives that we're obedient people, that we obey the Lord, that our life is marked by obedience, that not just occasionally they happen to obey, but they are an obedient follower of Jesus Christ? Number two this evening, the life of Joseph, not only a life marked by obedience, but I would say this, a life marked by troubles, a life marked by troubles. You know, the reality this evening is that Joseph faced a number of troubles in his life. We're familiar with them, we've studied them now over these past several months of studying the book of Genesis and particularly this last portion of the book of Genesis and we find that his life had many troubles, but we find that in our lives, that our lives too have many troubles. Listen, trouble is never an excuse to disobey. Trouble is never an excuse to just quit and throw in the towel and say, you know what, it's not worth it. I got all these problems and all these troubles and no one understands and woe is me and I have a right to, no, no, no. Trouble is no excuse to disobey the Lord. Trouble is no excuse to give up on following the Lord. Job says this in Job chapter 14, a verse that we're familiar with, man that is born of woman is a few days and full of trouble. And you say, man, I found that to be the case. That is my new life verse and my life is full of troubles. The reality is that trouble, sometimes we get our own selves in trouble, amen. We do crazy things and get ourselves in trouble and it's our own fault, it's our own doing. But other times life just has troubles. There's just troubles in life. There are difficulties, there's those that oppose us. I think about Joseph here as we think about his life. I think about the troubles that he had with his brothers. Really, was there anything that Joseph did that resulted in that trouble? No, Joseph didn't go asking for it. Joseph didn't mess up and get himself in trouble, no. Joseph was obedient to his father. Joseph was, he was the one that received the coat of many colors. He didn't go ask his dad for it. He wasn't trying to compete for it. As best we can tell from scripture, there was no competition among the brothers for who would get the trophy, if you will, be the recipient of this coat of many colors. No, Jacob bestowed it upon him because he was his really favorite son, if we're honest with scripture. And he was the son of his old age and he gave him that. And his brothers hated him and his brothers could not speak peaceably unto him. And he goes out following the command of his father. As you study through the scriptures and you find that he goes to sea to bring a report back to dad and they see him afar off and they conspire against him. Let us kill him. Here comes that dreamer. Let's see what's gonna happen. Let's see what's gonna come of these dreams. And Joseph just happens to come upon them and they snatch him and they tear that coat off of him and they throw him into a pit and they're planning to kill him. They sell him into slavery. Think about those troubles. It's really nothing that he did wrong that resulted in those troubles. They were just troubles that came in his life. He gets sold into slavery, ends up in Egypt in a foreign land. And we find that he's there, that he's purchased by Potiphar and he's a servant. Really he's of great position within the house of Potiphar. He says so much so that there's none greater in the house than me. What a great position. But Potiphar's wife came after him. She lied about him and he ends up in prison. He didn't do anything wrong. In fact, he did everything right. Amen? Biblically speaking, he did everything right. I often, and I said it during the message of that chapter, he lost his coat, but he retained his character. Better to lose his coat and be falsely accused than to jeopardize his walk with God. He said, how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? The trouble came, he ends up in prison and we understand. And again, when we think about the life of Joseph, when we think about a life marked by troubles, listen, we have troubles in our lives. Sometimes our own doing, but many times outside of our control, just things that happen. The enemy attacking and the enemy trying to cause us to stop serving the Lord. I think about Psalm 34, it's a precious Psalm of David. David makes two powerful statements in this chapter with regard to troubles. The first one is this in Psalm 34 in verse number six. He says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. Now David had some troubles that were not of his own doing. David had some troubles that were the result of his own doing. All right, really you can look at David's life in two aspects and you can see some of the troubles that David had, they're his own doing. Some of the troubles that David had, he had nothing to do. He didn't ask to be anointed to be the king. He didn't ask to go and to be in the place where he was there with Saul, to be hunted by Saul and all of those things. And we find that he says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of. all of his troubles, but I want you to skip over, you see that in verse 6 of Psalm 34, look at verse 19 if you will. I find the truth of verse number 6, I'm actually going to back it up and look at verse 17, but I think of the truth of verse number 6 where David is sharing his testimony, he's testifying of his own personal experience. This is my experience, I had troubles but God heard me when I cried and God delivered me. The Bible says this, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles. Notice this verse 18, the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and save it such as be of a contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. And I'm so thankful that though we have trouble in life, we have a God who is greater. We have a God who has purpose. We have a God that in the midst of the trouble he can bring to pass great things. If we simply remain faithful, if we simply remain steadfast, if we simply remain obedient and keeping our eyes on the Lord, even in the midst of the trouble and the difficulty, we can see God work. We see that in the life of Joseph. We see a man who walked with God in spite of the troubles, in spite of the difficulties. I mean I think about the time in prison and we don't know exactly how long Joseph was in prison, but we know that he was forgotten in prison for two years. How long was he in prison before the butler and the baker came into prison and had the dream? We don't know for sure the timeline, but we know that after the butler and the baker were delivered and the butler was told, remember me, and given that instruction, the text begins that two years, after two years, that's when Pharaoh had a dream. That's when the butler remembered about his experience in prison with Joseph and the dream that he had and the dream that the baker had and the interpretation thereof. We find that Joseph, during that two years, as best we can tell from Scripture, he just continued to walk with God. He just continued to do what he was supposed to do, praise the Lord, in the midst of trouble and the midst of difficulty. He didn't run a campaign, woe is me, I'm here and I don't deserve to be here and I've been falsely accused and imprisoned and so on and so forth. No, he just was obedient to the Lord and he was used of God in that place. The Bible tells us the Lord was with him. We find a life marked by obedience and a life marked by troubles. I would say this, number three, a life marked by blessing, a life marked by blessing. You want blessing in your life? Better learn to obey, amen, because the result of obedience is blessing. You say, but pastor, you just said that Joseph obeyed the Lord and there were troubles. Yeah, I did say that. Listen, not everything that we call a blessing is really a blessing. And not everything the world would identify as not being a blessing is not a blessing. I'm thankful, listen, the psalmist says that he rejoiced for being afflicted. Why? Because it was then that he learned the statutes of the Lord. Some of us wouldn't look at being afflicted as being a blessing, but I would submit to you this evening that indeed it was a blessing. Because if we learn more about our God in that time of difficulty, then to God be the glory that he allowed us to experience that. Brother Armando shared with me not long ago how that during that trial of great health trial when he was in Guatemala and thought he was going to die, how close he got to God during that time. We find this evening that we could look at the life of Joseph and yes, it's not contradictory to say that it was a life marked by troubles, but also a life marked by blessing. God knows his people, God has a plan for his people, and God blesses obedience. I begin to think about the position of Joseph. In Genesis chapter 41 and verse number 43, God tells us that Pharaoh made Joseph ruler over all the land of Egypt. When Joseph was in that pit, when Joseph was in that prison, he really didn't know that he would one day be in a palace and be the ruler over all the land of Egypt. We know that because we are familiar with the account of the life of Joseph because we've read it and we've studied it and so we're familiar with it. But I want you to, even as I mentioned this morning, consider that first read of the life of Joseph, if you will. And as you're reading the life of Joseph and you see him in the pit and you see him in the prison and you see all that's taking place, and then you find how that eventually he comes to the palace, it's amazing how God orchestrated all of those circumstances. In fact, the reality is that had the butler remembered Joseph prior to the Pharaoh having the dream, the Pharaoh probably couldn't care less that there was a man in prison that could interpret dreams. Why? He had plenty of magicians and astrologers and those that he would go to for interpreting of dreams, but it was at the very moment that he had a dream and there were none within Egypt that could interpret. The butler says, I remember. And with haste they bring Joseph and they bring him into the presence. He cleans himself up and he comes in the presence and Pharaoh says, I understand that you can interpret dreams. And Joseph says this, he says that it's not in him, it's not in me, but God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. What a great testimony. God brings Joseph to this place of position and we find that Pharaoh so much so in understanding the interpretation and the plan that is set forth, he says that he was going to set this man Joseph in charge. Why? Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? And he sets him in charge. He tells him that only in the throne would Pharaoh be greater. Joseph was 30 years old when this took place. We find that he had this blessing of a position. We find that God blessed him with family in the same chapter. We're told of the wife that he receives but also of his two sons and the Bible tells us in Genesis 41 and verse 50, unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which Asenath, the daughter of Potiphar, a priest of Ahon, bear unto him. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. Names meant something very significant during Bible times, sometimes still today, and some cultures names carry great significance in their meaning. Unfortunately, in many of our American culture ideas, we pick our names because we like the name. We don't want much significance or thought that is put into the particular name. We find that the Bible says that he named him Manasseh. Why? For God said he hath made me forget all my toil in all my father's house. The name of the second called Ephraim, notice this, for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. Isn't that a great statement? You know, you can be fruitful. You can have the blessing of God no matter where you are. It's amazing. We've now been in Northern Virginia for 13 years and I remember many years before we ever moved to Northern Virginia saying something like this, who would ever want to live in Northern Virginia? I remember passing through this corridor on many a time visiting family, my brother's station in North Carolina and we in Pennsylvania where we lived and we'd have to drive through this corridor, this 95 corridor, right, going through the beltway and all of that. And it didn't seem to matter what time of day you ever made the journey, you always figured you'd hit traffic in Northern Virginia. You always try to time it and, you know, miss the traffic. People ask me now after living here all these years, how's traffic? It's bad all the time. I mean, there's just really not a good time to go. It's just the way it is. And then you try to jump on the expressway and you might as well just, I don't know, run over your paycheck or something if you're going to pay for the tolls and it's crazy. But I remember saying, who would ever want to live there? I remember saying that, I'm being honest with you. And then I remember when God orchestrated and we found out about this church in Oakton and I thought, man, I've told this story before but I thought that's a sweet little name of a town named after a tree, right, an oak tree. And in my mind's eye I had a picture of Oakton being something like what you would see in the southwestern part of our state, just kind of a quaint little town, nice little, you know, whatever. And then I looked it up on the internet and I said to Holly, this might as well be Washington, D.C. And sure enough. But God called us here. And you know. You know, the reality is that as many people as we've met over the years, I was talking to somebody not long ago, to our children actually, in the time that we've had the privilege of being here, we've had, I believe the number now is 56 different families that have joined the church over these years. And out of the 56 families that have joined the church, 34 of them have moved away. And you begin to think about that, why, what happens? You know how many people say, I don't like it here? They want to move. That's just the idea, they get here and they say, I don't like the pace of life, I don't like this, I don't like that, so on and so forth. Listen, God has us here for a reason. God has us here for a reason. You know the world is in our backyard? The world is in our backyard. You can meet people from every continent, save Antarctica, I've never met anyone from there, but you can meet people from all over the globe. What a great opportunity. See, we need to be careful of how we view things, and we need to understand that God can bless. God has you here for a season and for a reason. And we begin to understand that this is where God wants me and this is where God has me, and as we're in the place where God has us, that God can make us fruitful and allow us to have blessing. What a joy to know that we're in the place where God has us, even if we might call it the land of our affliction. I don't refer to it that way, I love it. I never thought I would say that I love Northern Virginia, but I really did. There are certain aspects of it that drive you crazy, you just kind of get used to it. But the reality is that I'm thankful that Joseph understood that he could have the blessing of God and be fruitful in the place where he was. I think about the life marked by a blessing, even in the reunion with his family. If you were to read, and we've studied in recent weeks, the 46th and 47th chapter of the book of Genesis, when Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers and says to have dad and the family come, and it would be in the place of Egypt that Joseph would provide for them a place, and he would sustain them, and how you read of the reunion with his father, and what joy. I mean, just even looking at the reunion with his brothers, the ones who hated him, the ones that sold him into slavery, but there's a sweet reunion that God records for us in the 46th chapter of the book of Genesis, and then you read at the end where Jacob comes, and what a blessing to consider the opportunity that God gave him, and how the obedience of Joseph through his life, it's a life that's marked by a blessing. We mentioned this just a few weeks ago in Genesis chapter 49, when Jacob, dad, has all the boys brought before him. He begins in verse 22, speaking of Joseph, and he says that Joseph is a fruitful bow, even a fruitful bow by a well, whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode in strength. The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. On fence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel. What a blessing to think about Joseph's life, a life that's marked by a blessing. I would say finally this evening, the life of Joseph is a life that is marked by faith. Life that is marked by faith. We come to this 50th chapter, and we find that Joseph, the Bible tells us that he's 110 years old, and he says to his brethren in verse 24, I die. Very similar to what we've read with regard to Jacob, knowing that he would soon die, and he calls for his family to be in his presence, and he gives that final request, and puts his feet back up in bed and dies. And Joseph says to his brethren, I die. But I want you to see what Joseph says, and how we see that his life was a life marked by faith. The Bible says that he says in verse 24, God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So Joseph died being 110 years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. Begin to think about the faith of Joseph, and a life that's marked by faith. We see it in these statements, and he believed that God would do what God said he would do. He believed that God had promised to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob a land. He believed, even as God had shared with Jacob in chapter 46, before Jacob would leave that land and go to Egypt, that God said to Jacob, I am God, the God of thy father, fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation, and I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. Genesis 46, three and four. And Joseph believed that. Joseph did not live long enough to see it come to pass, but his eye of faith, he says in verse number 24, and again in verse 25, notice he says, God will surely visit you. I mean, confident faith, expecting that God will do what God said he will do. Not only was he convinced that God would visit and bring the nation into the land that he promised, but he says in verse number 25 that he took an oath of them, saying, carry up my bones from hence. You know, it's not until Joshua chapter 24 that we read of that being fulfilled, and we find that after, if you think about Genesis chapter 50, and you think about the period if you enter into the book of Exodus where there's another pharaoh, another king of Egypt that rises up that doesn't know Joseph, and all that generation dies, and you begin to think about the Egyptian bondage and all that takes place, and eventually you come to the place of the Exodus and the deliverance from Egypt land, followed by what? The wilderness wanderings. Though God never intended that that would be the plan, his plan was to deliver them from Egypt into the land, because of their disobedience and lack of faith, they wandered in the wilderness, but we come to the book of Joshua, and the book of Joshua provides us with that record of the entrance into, the conquering of, the inhabiting of the land of the nation of Israel, the land of Canaan, that land of promise. And we find that as God would give to us the book of Joshua, and we find that we come to the end of the book, and the Bible tells us in verse 29 of Joshua 24, and it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died being a hundred and ten years old. They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Sarai, which is in Mount Ephraim on the north side of the hill of Gash, and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord that He had done for Israel. And notice verse 32, the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver, and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. That's a long time that passes, but Joseph's bones are taken out of Egypt. We find that they're brought into this burying place that God tells us of in Shechem, in Joshua 24 and verse 32, but I want you to think about a life marked by faith. It's interesting, for Joseph finds himself in the Hall of Faith chapter, sort of the book of Hebrews, if you will, the 11th chapter, and we'll end here this evening. We think of Hebrews chapter 11, we've often referred to this chapter as the Hall of Faith chapter. Those that, by faith, they believed God and how they were moved and what they did and so on and so forth, and we find that Joseph, the statement that we read in Genesis 50, is recorded for us in Hebrews chapter 11. It tells us this in Hebrews 11 and verse 22. By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones. By faith he believed God. The Bible tells us the just shall live by faith. Amen? The Bible tells us in this chapter, in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse number 6, without faith it is impossible to please Him. For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. God desires that His people would live a life of faith, that we believe God. I believe the most simple definition of faith is believing God, taking God at His Word. It doesn't mean that you can understand how everything's going to work out, it just means that you believe God. I think of Paul when he's in the storm, the end of the book of Acts, and he stands and he simply says, I believe God, that it shall be as it was revealed unto me. There was an angel that stood by him and told him of the deliverance that would come to pass. And in that particular storm they were hoping and wishing for the day, they thought for sure they were all dead men, but he said, I believe God. Not one will be lost. And you know what? They made it ashore. None of them lost their lives. This evening we think about the life of Joseph, we end this wonderful book, the book of Genesis, a life that's marked by obedience, a life that's marked by troubles, a life that's marked by blessing, and a life that's marked by faith. I wonder tonight if each of us were to examine our own lives, better yet if someone to read your story, what would they walk away with? See, most of us are probably pretty glad that God didn't record our story for countless generations of people to study, amen? But if He did, how would someone conclude your life? What would the summary statements be that are made of your life? I hope that it could be said, even as it's said of Joseph, as we make these conclusion type statements, it's a life marked by obedience, troubles, yes, blessings, abundant, a life of faith. He believed God. Oh, that God would help us to have faith. Oh, that God would help us to obey Him, to just follow Him. You say, but the troubles, yes, the troubles will come. Keep your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. He's got a plan. He does, He doeth all things well. We serve a great God. Joseph, 54 years summarized in just a few verses of Scripture, an exemplary Bible character, one in which we look at his life and we say, oh, that God would allow me to be used in like fashion. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. Thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word, the truth that's contained therein. We thank You for the life of Joseph. I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to be men and women of faith, men and women of obedience. Help us to be used of Thee. I pray, Lord, that in this moment of invitation that You'd have Your will and way. Lord, maybe there's someone that's been living in disobedience, Lord, someone that's tried to justify some of their disobedience. Oh, I pray, Holy Spirit, that You'd convict them and help them, Lord, to respond not by justification but respond with confession. Lord, help us to have faith. Help us to live by faith. I pray that You'd increase our faith. Help us to believe You. I pray that You'd move and work as only You can for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Holly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open.",
