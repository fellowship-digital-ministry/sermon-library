Our God is great and he can speak to our hearts whether we're in a room or whether we're at home, we're listening on live stream, God is able. I was thinking to myself, God could speak to Jonah when Jonah was in the belly of a whale. God found Peter on a rooftop, spoke to his heart. He found John in exile on the Isle of Patmos and spoke to John there. So I think God is able even in 2021 to allow us to be in our living room or somewhere on live stream, some in the auditorium, very few. And he is able to speak to our hearts. It really is about our attitude. And so my prayer is, is that you will just for these next few moments, allow the Lord through his Holy Spirit to take his word and speak to your heart. And let's just see what God can do in our lives. It'll be a wonderful thing. Take your Bible if you would and turn with me to Psalm 89. I appreciate pastor allowing me to be here. We are friends and for some period of time pastored in the same area. And I'm glad for all the years that we had in the DC area. We moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where we have two sons, but I will always be a Virginian at heart. I love Virginia, even the traffic of Northern Virginia. Maybe not so much that part. Psalm 89, and let's notice beginning in verse one. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. For I have said, mercy shall be built up forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. I have made a covenant with my chosen. I have sworn unto David, my servant. Thy seed will I establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord. Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee? Let's pray and ask God to help us. Father, we're so grateful for this morning that you've given us to be together in whatever way you've allowed us to be in tune with this service. Lord, we're not gathering because we are people who have it all figured out. We're gathering because we are needy people. We need your Holy Spirit's help. We need your word. Lord, we need your touch upon our lives. And we offer ourselves in these few moments for you to speak to us, to teach us. Lord, there are so many that need encouragement and I pray that you would encourage them today. But Lord, we also need to be convicted. And where we need conviction and where we need to change attitude, action, words, I pray that you would impress that upon our hearts and help us not to be stiff-necked, but to be willing to hear you and make the changes with the help of your Holy Spirit that would please you in our lives. So work in our hearts. Thank you for this moment. We pray in Jesus' name, amen. If you were to ask me, what is the highest Christian virtue? Of course, I would say love, because I believe love is the abiding great virtue. But one of the virtues that I would rank very, very highly is the virtue of faithfulness. I love faithfulness. I love the testimony of preachers, if you will. I am one and so allow me to be self-interested for a moment. I love preachers who have been at it and stay at it in the way that they have energy to do, but for a long time. I love that. I love Sunday school teachers who teach for a long time. I think the greatest crown to be given in heaven will be given to teachers who taught junior high boys for 40 years. They deserve a crown for sure. I love faithfulness in marriage. And I'm an older fellow. I listened to Paul Harvey when he was on the radio and I used to love a segment that he had. It was called the Tournament of Roses. And when he would talk about the Tournament of Roses, he would mention a couple who had been married 60, 70 years and he would just honor them. And I think that's praiseworthy. I just love the thought of faithfulness. And as much as we could talk about the faithfulness that we see in men and women, here's the truth. Our faithfulness, if any, is only evidence of God's faithfulness to us. And when we praise faithfulness, may we first understand that it is God's faithfulness in our lives that allow us to move, to do, and to have the privilege over years of pleasing him. When I come to this great psalm, I understand something about faithfulness. I want you to notice some things in introduction. If your Bible has ascriptions for the psalm, mine says that it is a maskial of Ethan the Ezraite. That word maskial just simply means that it is a psalm written to instruct, a psalm written to instruct. So when we come to Psalm 89, we know that God's intention is to teach us something. Now, notice in verse one, the latter phrase, thy faithfulness to all generations. Notice verse two, latter phrase, thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. Verse five, thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. Notice verse eight, or to thy faithfulness round about thee. I am not the brightest bulb in the pack, I assure you. But when God says I've written a maskial, which has the intention of instructing us, and four times in the first eight verses, we're told about the faithfulness of God, I get it. This is a psalm to instruct God's people about his faithfulness to his own. Well, second, I want you to notice who wrote this psalm. It's important to understand a little bit about Ethan the Ezraite. I won't take you there for the sake of time, but if we went to 1 Chronicles 15, verse 17, we would learn that Ethan, of course, is a Levite, and Ethan was put in charge of worship. Now, as a Levite, he was to study and care about and teach the word of God, and he and his family have this special calling, or special responsibility of teaching and leading in worship. One of the other things I learned about Ethan was in 2 Chronicles, I'm sorry, 1 Kings 4, verse 31, that his wisdom is compared to the wisdom of Solomon. Now, it doesn't say that he is as wise as Solomon, but I would suggest to you that if you're even mentioned in the same verse, you're a pretty wise guy. I don't know about you, but I do know about me. I do not know one word of Hebrew other than shalom, okay? But I have a strong concordance, and it often makes me dangerous. And I love to understand names, especially as they are in the Old Testament, because God often will communicate an important thought or a trait about that person through their name. And so, as I was studying this passage, it occurred to me I'd love to know what that name Ethan means. I looked it up in my strong concordance and was amazed. It means literally to be permanent, to be constant. Now, I wanna put that together for just a moment. Here's God wanting to instruct his people about his faithfulness. So he chooses a man to inspire through his Holy Spirit to write about his faithfulness to God's people, and that man is a Levite who is a teacher of the people of God. He is a man who is wise. And he is a man whose character, I believe God is communicating to us, is one of faithfulness. Now all of that I find very interesting, but I'll tell you the thing in my study and introduction that really amazed me. It is when the psalm was written. When did God decide to inspire Ethan to write a psalm about his faithfulness? I could have understood it if it was written during the reign of David, because David was the sweet singer of Israel. He was the man after God's own heart. He was a flawed man, but he was a man after God's own heart, and we so identify that kingdom of Israel with David. But it wasn't written when David was king. I could have even understood if it was written when Solomon was king, because under Solomon, the kingdom reached its zenith. The greatest cities were built. The greatest armies were in the field. There was just a great sense of prosperity and blessing, but it wasn't written when Solomon was king. Do you know when God inspired Ethan to write Psalm 89? Right after the kingdom split, when Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, had made such an unwise decision following the counsel of the young men rather than the elders, and the kingdom was split, and Jeroboam came back from Egypt and took 10 tribes and went to the north and Samaria, made his capital. That is now called Israel or Ephraim, and Rehoboam is left with two tribes in the south, Judah and Benjamin. It is called Judah, and in the midst of the kingdom being rent, in the midst of the greatest chaos Israel had ever experienced, in the midst of when you would wonder, does God even know where we are? Does God even care about who we are? That's when God said to Ethan, Ethan, I want you to remind my people about something, that regardless of the circumstances, regardless of what they think they see, regardless of what they're experiencing, my faithfulness never changes. I know where they are, I know where I'm taking them, I know what they're experiencing, and I am utterly faithful. And when I understand that, to be honest with you, the thing that occurs to me is this, because the rest of the psalm is not necessarily about God's faithfulness, it speaks to what our response to God's faithfulness should be, even in difficult circumstances. I want you to notice several of them this morning. Here's number one. Our response to God's faithfulness ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit that celebrates God's faithfulness. I'll say it again. Our response to God's faithfulness ought to be to have a rejoicing spirit that celebrates God's faithfulness. Go with me to verse one again. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. I think somebody ought to write a song like that, don't you? Oh, wait a minute, they did. A chorus, it's a wonderful chorus that we sing as children, but it has one of the greatest truths that too often as adults we forget. You see, we as adults can be so quick to be grumbling, so quick to complain in all that God has done for us and in all that God is presently doing for us. There are times that out of the mouths of believers, God does not hear praise and God does not hear rejoicing. Instead, God hears complaining and it is not an innocent thing. I'm reminded of the time that Israel was in the wilderness. They had come up out of Egypt and oh, how they rejoiced when they came up out of Egypt and oh, how they loved God and God brought them to the edge of that Red Sea and almost instantaneously the beginning complaint began. God parted the Red Sea and they went across the Red Sea and then of course we know the story of the spies and the wrong decision made and here's the truth. Because of that wrong decision, that unbelief, they were destined to spend 40 years in the wilderness of Sinai. I don't know if you've ever been to the wilderness of Sinai but it's not a garden spot, it is truly wilderness. You can't grow crops there to sustain a million people. You can't find enough water to sustain your flocks and your herds. It's not a comfortable place to dwell and yet during those 40 years, think with me for a moment, their sandals never wore out, their clothes never deteriorated and every day they had flocks out there, there was enough water for their herds and their flocks and for them and oh yeah, every single morning other than Sabbath morning they would wake up and they would see out there what appeared to be dew at first but when you walked up on it, it was of a white coriander seed, it looked like coriander, it had the taste of fresh oil, it was manna and for every day of 40 years in a wilderness that could not sustain you, they ate, they had nutrition, it was tasty, it was provided of God for his people and can I remind you of what they did in Numbers 11? They complained about the provision of God and they said we loathe this white bread and God did not hold them innocent for it. Now I don't believe we live in the Old Testament and I'm not predicting that God will do with us what he did with them but of all people on the earth, it ought to occur to us, God is good to me. Even when the circumstances are difficult, God is good to me and I think we ought to join with Ethan and say, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever, I will sing, I will sing, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever even as I sit on 66 or 95 or even as there's no supplies at Costco and even though there's a pandemic and even though it seems like all is changing and all is falling apart, my God is good and able to supply and you and I right now, listen, it is so easy to have a grumbling, complaining spirit and as believers, it ought to stop in our lives and rejoice because God knows where we are, God knows what we need, God knows where he's taking us and God will deliver us to that place because God is utterly faithful. Here's number two, our faith can rest on God's faithfulness. Look at verse two, for I have said, mercy shall be built up forever, thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. There's not a lot that we can count on in these days. How many of you notice that politicians will often disappoint you? What is popular today will be forgotten tomorrow. Our own bodies and lives seem like they're always moving, always moving, always changing. What I could do yesterday, I can't do today and I don't know about you but sometimes I just wanna holler, let it stop, let it just stay here. I'll never forget years ago, I was in a hospital room where a husband and wife had just had a little baby and I loved those visits, it's a time of real joy and mom was attending to the baby and I was talking to dad and as we were talking, I overheard her whisper to this little baby, I want it to just stay like this. She's holding her child, the child is not crying and it's all peaceful, almost like a little halo resting over the child's head and I thought to myself, I wanted to turn to her as a fundamental Baptist preacher and say, well it ain't gonna stay there but I decided to be nice that day but it doesn't stay, it always moves, it always moves and to be honest with you, we're not promised. easy or comfortable or pleasant circumstances all our lives. But what we are promised is this, that as our lives are always and ever changing, and as the circumstances that surround us are always and ever changing, we have a sovereign God who is sovereign over the change in our lives. And I don't mean to be too elementary, but God says, God says, look to the heavens and comfort yourself when it is swirling around you and you don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, you don't know what you're gonna do, look to the heavens and remind yourselves, I do, God says. I don't know if you noticed it, but at about six o'clock last night, the sun went down. I follow the science, I am deeply scientific. How many of you noticed this morning at about six o'clock, the sun came up? Did you know that's gonna occur again today and again tomorrow and again the next day? And you say, well, yeah, preacher, because the earth goes around the sun because God did it on purpose. Because God wanted us to look at that and say, wow, has this thing changed, but wow, does God know and does God have control and God knows what happens in the night, in the dark, and God knows what happens in the day and God knows how to get me there. We're getting ready to experience my favorite season, fall. I love the chill in the air, I love the leaves getting ready to change. My favorite thing in the world is apples. I am the world's greatest apple connoisseur and it is harvest season for apples. And sadly, it's going to give way to my least favorite season of the year, which is winter. You say, don't you love the beauty of the snow? No, you have to shovel it. But it's gonna give way to spring and it's gonna give way to summer. You say, preacher, we know that. You said you wouldn't be elementary. It's elementary, but it's vital for us to understand that God is in control and God is able to bring life where there doesn't seem to be life. He is able to handle transition and he is able to move us through it. I love how the songwriter put this, and forgive my singing. ♪ Summer and winter, springtime and harvest ♪ ♪ Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above ♪ ♪ Join with all nature in manifold witness to what? ♪ ♪ To thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love ♪ And I love what the songwriter does. ♪ Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness ♪ ♪ Morning by morning, new mercies I see ♪ Now, you remember this line? ♪ All that I've needed, thy hand hath provided ♪ Regardless of the circumstances. ♪ Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness ♪ ♪ Lord, unto me. ♪ Boy, these are uncertain times, aren't they? Honestly, we don't know what a day will bring forth. I almost don't turn the news on because the news cycle is like 12 minutes, not 12 hours. But in all of this mess and all of this chaos, there is a God who can make night turn into day. There is a God who controls and by whom all these things consist and he moves us from summer to fall to winter to spring. God is utterly faithful. Here's number three. No human faithfulness can be compared to God's faithfulness. Look at verse eight. Look over at verse eight. Oh, Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee? I love, as I began this sermon, faithful men and women and their testimonies, but can I tell you the truth? Men and women, to include myself, will fail you. I told my congregation for years and years, hang around me long enough and I will disappoint you. There'll be something that I do, something that I say, I will disappoint you. And my friend, you cannot build your faith on a man. You can't build your faith on a political party. You can't build your faith on an IRA. You can't build your faith on a career. There is only one who never, ever fails us. That is God Almighty. Put your trust in him. Since I've been retired the few weeks that I'm home a year, one of the things I love to do is go with my wife grocery shopping. She does not love it when I go with her grocery shopping, but I love it. And we only shop at the finer stores, so we go to Walmart. And as we go into Walmart, there is a person there whose purpose in life is to make me feel good about myself being at Walmart. She's got, he or she's got a blue vest on, they've got a smiley face. Their job is to welcome me to Walmart. Not long ago, I went with my wife. We walked in, I pushed the cart, that's my job. And be careful not to hit her in the back. As we're going through and we're coming up to that door, I see her, she's there. This is gonna be great, I love people. I'm gonna greet her, she's gonna greet me. It's gonna make life wonderful. She makes eye contact with me and turns and walks away. Now can I tell you something? I will never go to Walmart again because of what that woman did. You take me too seriously, okay? I don't go to Walmart because I need somebody to make me feel good about myself. I go to Walmart because the Jif peanut butter is cheaper. I am so weary of people who use what is universally known that men will disappoint us as a reason to not worship and serve the Lord who will never fail them. Listen, I'm not making light that people have been hurt by Christians and in significant ways. Please do not think that's what I'm doing. But you and I have to understand that it is a devil's tactic to use the failure of men to cause us not to want to have fellowship and faithfully worship the one who is utterly faithful to us, who has never failed us. I don't come to church for somebody to make me feel good about myself. I come to church and sing and listen to preaching and learn of him to worship the one who is utterly faithful to me. And I pray that if somehow your life is marginalized by the failure of a person in your life, I'm not diminishing it. I'm just saying, beg God for the grace to get over it because he has never failed you. And you are harming your own spiritual walk. You're allowing the failure of failing men to keep you from serving and worshiping and loving and enjoying your walk with the Lord who has never, ever failed you. Notice this very quickly. Your sin does not change God's faithfulness. Turn over to verse 31 with me, would you? Here, Ethan says, if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments, then will I visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. This psalm, if we had time to really study it in depth, you would understand was to reassure Israel of the promises that God had made to David, that one of David's lineage would reign in perpetuity over Israel. That will be realized in the millennium when Jesus, the son of David, reigns literally from Jerusalem for 1,000 years. But now in the midst of this chaos, it looks like Israel's sin has broken the covenant and now God has forsaken them and he's not going to fulfill his promises to them. But that is never true. Yes, God is going to chastise them. He's going to deal with them. but in truth there is a remnant and God will bless them and God loves them even through the chastising. You say preacher how does that relate to me? Well I've been in ministry long enough that I've met a lot of people who use their failure as a reason to not be restored and be used of the Lord. Hey David was a flawed man. David committed adultery. I would suggest that's a very serious sin. David actually conspired in the murder of Uriah. David was a man who had was filled with pride at times and and numbered his armies because he wanted to see how great his empire was. David was as flawed as you and I. But can I remind you that God only has flawed people to work with and that God is able and God loves us so much that even when we fail, when we sin, that God's desire is for us to be restored and he convicts our hearts about what we've done and if we will repent and if we will look to him that you and I can be restored. Sometimes we have the image of God that he is in heaven and he's a God with a thunderbolt who's just waiting, just waiting for one of his kids to step out of line so that he can dash them with that thunderbolt. And I want to tell you that is not the accurate picture of who our God is. The accurate picture of our God comes from that great parable of the prodigal. A son takes what his father has given to him, the blessing of his father, and takes it to the far country and then wastes his his life in that place, finds himself in the pig pen having fed the hogs and hoping to eat a little bit of what he has fed to the pigs. And I love how simply the Bible puts it, it says he came to himself. And when he came to himself, he said to himself, what what am I doing in a hog pen? And he gets up and he makes the decision, I'm going back to my father. Now understand, when he goes back to his father, he doesn't know what the reception will be. He doesn't know whether his father will be there with a clenched fist, ready to beat him for his sin. He doesn't know if his father will completely ignore him, and he'll have no entrance to his father. He has no clue what it's going to be. But I want you to understand, on that day when he's approaching home and perhaps very nervous about what father is going to be, when he sees his father standing in the road because he was waiting and watching and hoping his son would come home, and his arms are wide open, that's the picture of our God. And I don't care whether we have failed him or not, I'm not minimizing sin, I'm maximizing the graciousness and the mercy of our God. And God says come home. One of the moments that has just burned into my mind, I preached a sermon somewhat along those lines, and a man came forward and he motioned to me, would you come down? And of course I would come down and speak with him and pray with him, and he said to me, I shouldn't be here. I said, well what do you mean you shouldn't be here? He said, well you've preached on this probably ten times in the years that I've been in this church, and he said, I've tried to get this thing squared away, and I've tried to do it, and every time I failed, and here I am back down here now. I've failed at this. And he said, I know God doesn't want me to be here, but I wanted you to know that I know God doesn't want me to be here. I said, what are you talking about? I said, of course God wants you to be here. God's message to the disciple was seven times seventy, and he wasn't teaching up to 490 times you can be forgiven. He was saying as long as you'll come, I'll work with you, I'll help you, I'll restore you. And look, I'm not trying to get people to run it out to 490 times to fail. What I'm telling you is, is the devil will keep you from experiencing fullness in Christ, because he will convince you that your failure disqualifies you for the love of God, and the blessing of God, and to be used of God, and restored. And I'm telling you, God says you come, because though your sin may have to be chastised, and though you must confess and repent of your failure, God says I will never utterly forsake you. One last thing and I'm done. You know what God is faithful to do? He is faithful to call upon those that will call upon him to be saved. I'm sorry, he's faithful to save those who will call upon him. I don't know about you, but I know about me. I wasn't raised in a Christian home. My mother and dad were not Christians. Mother may have been, but dad was definitely not a Christian. And he got saved when a soul winner came by the door at 63 years old, and they started serving the Lord. In 70, he became a deacon. My mother determined that she didn't raise her boys as Christians, but now that she was serving the Lord, they were going to know about the Lord. And so she determinedly would witness to us to the point where I finally had to say, I was married, we had children, and I finally had to say, mother you've made a decision. I'm glad for you and dad. You go the direction that he wants. God wants you to go. But for Nancy and I, we're content with our life. We're decent people, good people. We're going to do what we do. Long story short, she knew that I had an affinity for cobbler, blackberry cobbler. And she said to me one day, she said, Mike, do you do you want that blackberry cobbler? You're coming over for it. I said, well of course I want that blackberry cobbler. And she said, I left my dish at church, and you go right past that church. Could you just stop and pick that dish up? She had it set up, and the custodian, who was a tremendous soul winner, had the dish in his hand. And it wasn't coming out of his hand until I listened. And for 45 minutes he cornered me between a water fountain and a wall, and he told me I was a sinner, and he told me I deserved to go to hell. He told me that God loved me, my parents loved me, that yes, my mom did this so that he could talk to me about the Lord. I was under conviction. I got out of there without bowing my head and trusting Christ. I got home, thought back and play with the baby, and I'll forget this, and I'll feel better. And I got home, and my wife was gone with the baby. And my mother had given us a little ward Bible, $2 Bible, no red letters, no notes, no maps, just a Bible. And she had taken a red pen and a ruler and underlined Romans chapter 10, verses 9 and 10 and 13. And deeply under conviction, I took that Bible down from a shelf. We'd put it on a shelf. We didn't, we were glad to have it, didn't need it. And I opened that Bible to Romans chapter 10, verses 9 and 10 and 13, and read them. And that man had just talked to me about the gospel and about Jesus's resurrection, about his death, his resurrection, about his substitutionary death for me. And I knew in my heart, I did believe that. And I knew I had to confess that. And I came to Romans chapter 13, I'm sorry, chapter 10 and verse 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. I took that Bible over to our sofa. I laid it on the sofa. I kneeled down before the sofa. I prayed the most deeply theological prayer you've ever heard. It went something like this, God if you can save somebody like me, will you save me? And he did. Because God is utterly faithful. God is utterly faithful. That whether it is 1200 AD, 70 AD, or 2021 AD, if a man or a woman or a child will acknowledge that indeed they are sinners, and that their only hope of salvation is the gift that is given to us in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who came and loving us, lived on this earth for 33 years, and as the Bible says, was yet without sin. And gave himself to die on the cross, and in a transaction that I will never understand fully until I get to heaven, my sin is placed on him, and his righteousness is placed on me because of what he did. and because of my acceptance of that truth, and when God sees me, he no longer sees sinful Mike Edwards. He sees the righteousness of his Son, Jesus Christ. That is available to every person on this globe, because God is faithful to save all those who, understanding their need and confessing the truth of Christ, will call upon him. So a series of questions and I'm done. Have you developed a complaining spirit in the chaos and the confusion, the sadness of our world, the anger that surrounds us? Have you developed a spirit of grumbling? It's not an innocent thing, and you and I must be the testimonies of God's mercy and grace in this dark time, and our grumbling does not accomplish that. We may well have been handed the greatest soul-winning evangelism tool the world has known in hundreds of years in this pandemic, but if all our workmates here is our complaining about a mask, or our complaining about this and complaining about that, that will never draw people to the God that is so much bigger than all this. Are you fearful? There's a lot to be fearful about in this world, but you and I don't have to live fearfully. Our faith can rest on a God who knows where we are, what we need, where he's taking us, and how to get there. Have you been hurt, disappointed by someone? Don't let that marginalize your walk with the Lord. And how about this? Have you failed? Boy, a revival this time in our lives is a moment when we can say, God, I want to get back into it. Back into what? Back into serving you, back into pleasing you, back into loving you, back into sharing the truth, and Lord, will you help me? And he will. And then last, if you're here or under the sound of my voice on livestream, if you're not sure you've trusted Christ as your Savior, please, it is a matter of knowing your need because you are a sinner, knowing God's provision of his Son who willingly died on the cross without sin, not guilty, without sin, taking our sin upon him so that we could be made the righteousness of God in him. If you'll call upon the Lord, he'll save you. Would you pray with me? Father, we thank you so much for these few minutes you've given us, and thank you for the patience of people to listen to me. And I pray just now, whether folks are here or at home, whether they need to kneel at their sofa or kneel at their chair or at their table, whatever it is, God, a grumbling spirit is not an innocent thing, and I pray they deal with that. And Lord, being fearful in this time, it's understandable, but it's not acceptable for the Christian. We've got a God, you, who are able to care for us in the midst of this chaos. And for those who have been hurt and use that hurt as a reason not to serve and live for you, deal with them and help them with that hurt. Lord, for those who have failed, they've sinned, they have broken fellowship with you, would you convince them that you love them, that you want to restore them? And for those who are unsaved, Father, if they will but make this simple acknowledgment that they are indeed sinners, and then believe that your Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth, lived sinlessly, died on a cross for them, and rose from the dead, and is coming again, if they will confess that with their mouth, you are utterly faithful to save. So Lord, work in our lives and accomplish these things, I pray, in Jesus' name, amen.",
