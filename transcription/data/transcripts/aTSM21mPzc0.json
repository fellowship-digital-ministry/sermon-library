  "text": "the message but it was on my heart and I hope that this morning all that thrills your soul is Jesus. Aren't you thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ? Amen. Praise the Lord. Where'd we be without Him? Hopeless, helpless, right? Praise the Lord. Jesus is the sweetest name I know. It truly is. You know when I hear the name Jesus it means something. It means something. It brings to my mind who Jesus is. Not according to what the world might say but according to what God's Word says, what He revealed to us. And I'm so thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ personally. Last week in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we dealt with verse number 17 and this week we're going to deal with verses 18 through 20. I've titled the message We Are His Ambassadors. In Acts chapter 5 and verse 32, you don't need to turn there, but the disciples declared we are His witnesses. What a great declaration for the disciples as they're dealing with all sorts of persecution and resistance and they'd been facing various levels of persecution up to that point and they're given threats from the religious leaders that are to no longer speak in the name of Jesus. They're not to preach anymore in the name of Jesus and they make this declaration. There are several declarations that they make but one of them is we are His witnesses. We find that John would later say in 1 John chapter number 1 how that he was an eyewitness and that he's given us this account and really this morning we can rejoice in understanding that we are His witnesses. The apostle Paul as he's writing to the church in Corinth here in the book of 2 Corinthians, we find that he's going to provide greater instruction in the passage of scripture that we're going to study this morning with regard to the ministry that he spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 1. If you note there in your Bible that the apostle Paul says, therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not and we find that in these few verses of scripture in 2 Corinthians 5 verses 18 through 20 Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God is going to provide greater instruction and information to us with regard to the ministry that he spoke of in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 in verse number 1. We find that in this text of scripture as I mentioned in Acts 5 in verse 32 that the disciples say we are his witnesses but we find here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 that we see a distinguished title given to those who are entrusted with this ministry that the apostle Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 4 verse number 1. We have this ministry and that distinguished title that he gives to us is that of ambassador. Ambassador. What a title. What a description. I believe that every word of God is pure. I believe that God chose his words with purpose and I believe that as we look at this passage of scripture and see this word ambassador it is communicating something extremely important to us this morning. I find that in the New Testament that the word ambassador is only used twice in all of the New Testament. We find that the apostle Paul as he's writing to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians chapter 6 in verse number 20 he refers to himself as being an ambassador in bonds and we understand the apostle Paul as he would even say later to Timothy though he was bound the word of God is not bound and what a blessing and the apostle Paul that while he was in prison he still recognized this distinguished title that he was an ambassador though he had been in prison though he did not have the same level of liberties that he once had he recognized that he was still an ambassador and as you study through the New Testament you study the the truth of God's word you'll find that the apostle Paul even while he was bound even while he faced times of imprisonment that he was actively sharing the gospel because he recognized that he was an ambassador for Christ and we find that there were people that got saved there were people that trusted Christ as their personal Lord and Savior why because he was faithful to do the work that God had entrusted to him to fulfill we find that as he's writing to the church in Philippi it's very interesting the church in Philippi how did the church start what was the circumstances regarding the apostle Paul in Philippi well we know that shortly after the the healing and what took place with that demonic possessed girl that we find that he's imprisoned Paul and Silas they're imprisoned in Philippi they're singing and praising God but Paul you're in prison but God is good God has a plan my life is his I'm in his hand he's singing praises and at midnight the Bible says that God sent an earthquake and that jailer who is ready to kill himself supposing that all the prisoners had escaped he he finds out Paul says we're all here do yourself no harm and he says sirs what must I do to be saved Paul later writing to the church at Philippi he would say to that church that he did not want them to have this misunderstanding he didn't want them to have be ignorant concerning the things that befell him he tells them this in the first chapter he wanted them to understand that it happened for the furtherance of the gospel we find that as you come to the end of chapter four of the book of Philippians that Paul begins to write the names and those that were saved that were of the household of Caesar how they get saved God who knows all things who do with all things well he allowed for the apostle Paul to be imprisoned and he allowed for the apostle Paul to be in that place and to have those prison guards and those of the household and and Paul got the opportunity to share the gospel with him he didn't just have a pity party he didn't just say woe is me I mean it's not fair I was just preaching I was just doing what God called me to do and I I'm gonna give up no he just kept doing what God called him to do and God blessed and here as we look at the apostle Paul making that statement in Ephesians 6 that he was an ambassador in bonds we find that that's one use of the word but we find that here in our text that he says to the believers in Corinth and by way of application to us as well this morning that we are ambassadors for Christ note the passage with me beginning in verse 18 the bible says this and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in God Christ dead be ye reconciled to God this morning as we think about this truth that we are his ambassadors I want you to consider first with me this morning the privilege of being an ambassador it's a great privilege to be an ambassador sometimes I believe and I've been guilty of this in my own life in my own ministry sometimes we might focus more on the responsibility side of things versus the privilege side of things the reality this morning we understand it is absolutely true that that we do have a responsibility but I hope this morning that as we think about this this truth this this this this title that is given to us as being an ambassador that we recognize the privilege to be appointed by the king of kings and lord of lords to be his representative to be his ambassador what a joy we say this this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blues what the songwriter said we sing it the bible tells us in the book of hebrews in the 11th chapter that we're strangers and pilgrims the reality is that sometimes if we're not careful brother mark we dealt you dealt with this a little bit in sunday school this morning if we're not careful sometimes this world can almost be more like our home we treat it that way but this world is not my home I'm an ambassador what is an ambassador it's representative it's a privilege in an appointed position we find that that the lord jesus christ he showed to us he gave us in this passage this this understanding of the privilege it's necessary that we acknowledge this morning the great privilege that is ours the honor that is ours to be an ambassador for the lord jesus christ the one who is the king of kings the lord of lords the one who knows all things and he says to us that we are his ambassadors it's amazing paul would say as he's writing to the church in ephesus that our citizenship is in heaven our citizenship is in heaven it's interesting of an ambassador an ambassador is one who represents a foreign country you think about a u.s ambassador that's going to another country it is said uh that while george schultz was during the Reagan administration, that he would meet with every newly appointed ambassador before he or she left for the new posting. As he would meet with them in his office, he kept this globe there in his office, and he would say, as he would bring in the individual, he'd bring up that globe, and he would say this, show me where your country is. That's what he would say. And it says this, this was the account, that almost in every case, the new ambassador would spin the globe, they would find the country in which they were appointed to or assigned to, and they would point to it. And Mr. Schultz would correct them. And he would point to America, and he would say this, this is your country. Why? Because they had to understand they were representing the U.S. in whatever country they were going to. That was their purpose. Can I tell you this morning, we can't take a globe and point to heaven, but can I tell you if you're saved this morning, if you're a child of God, your citizenship is in heaven. This world is not my home. Amen? Listen, we're here for a purpose, and we're ambassadors. We're to represent the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a privilege that we have to be his ambassadors. In John chapter 20, turn there very quickly, if you will, I want you to notice what Jesus says in John chapter 20. We understand that we could go to each of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. We could go to the book of Acts, and we could deal with the Great Commission this morning. But I want you to see the way in which Jesus says it in John chapter 20. In John chapter 20, we find that the resurrection has already taken place, and Jesus is appearing. It's the evening of the same day, according to verse number 19. He appears, and he says, Peace be unto you at the end of the verse. But I want you to notice that as he's there, in verse 20, it says, When he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you. And then notice what Jesus says, As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. I'm thankful that Jesus left the throne room of heaven to come to this sin-cursed world, to die in my place and in your place, to go to that old cross, to be buried in a borrowed tomb, to rise, conquering sin, death, and the grave. But I understand this morning that the resurrected Christ, that he now has ascended to heaven, he's on the right hand of the throne of God, and we find that what he's commissioned, he said, as I've been sent, now I'm sending you. We're his ambassadors. It's a privilege. The apostle Paul says it this way as he's talking to the church in Thessalonica. Notice, if you will, in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, the Bible tells us that, of course, Paul had had the opportunity during the second missionary journey. You read Acts 17. You can see of the time in which he went to Thessalonica. But as he says this to this church, this group of believers, notice the perspective of the apostle Paul in 1 Thessalonians 2 and verse number 4. He says, but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. He says that we were allowed of God to be in trust with the gospel. You think about the gospel, the death, burial, and glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. We read that in Romans chapter 1. And we find that the apostle Paul, as he's communicating to this church in Thessalonica, he says, I want you to gain this perspective that we have been allowed of God to be entrusted, to be put in trust with the gospel. This morning, do you recognize the privilege that is ours to be an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ? It's absolutely amazing. I believe this morning that it is appropriate and it's necessary at times that we focus and we deal with the responsibility that we have. It's important we have missions conferences, we have missionaries that come in throughout the calendar year to stir us up and to speak to us about the responsibility to the desires to reach the world with the gospel. And what a task that God has given to us. Yes, we've been commanded. Yes, we have a responsibility. But I want you to look at it from a perspective of privilege. Not just duty. Not just duty. But privilege. There's a privilege. To be able to sit down with someone and tell them about the one who loves them more than anyone else. The one, the only one, that can save them and change their lives. What a privilege that has been given to us. And we find that we recognize that it's been given to us for we find in our text in 2 Corinthians 5 that the Bible says in verse 18, we spoke already in the past two weeks about verses 14 and 15 and that he died for all in verse 15 that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again. We dealt with verse 17 last week. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, they're saved, they're born again. The Bible says that he's a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. But then we find in verse 18, the Bible says that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and then notice, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. He did not give this ministry of reconciliation to anyone other than those who have been reconciled. See, you have to be reconciled before you can be engaged in the work and the ministry of reconciliation. The angels desire to look into it but they cannot be engaged in the ministry of reconciliation because they can't, they're not reconciled. They don't need to. But this morning, we think of this passage and the privilege that is ours. I'm so thankful to know the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior. The privilege of knowing him and serving him and knowing that he's given me. You know, it's amazing to begin to think about who we are in Christ. Who he is to us and who we are in him. We find that as many as receive him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. We find in 1 John 3, John stands up and says, behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Hallelujah. And he says we're his ambassadors. What a privilege. What a privilege this morning. We have gospel tracks out there. We have opportunities for outreach and ministry and try to reach people. Why? It's a privilege. Yes, it's a responsibility, but it's a privilege. It's a privilege to go as a representative, as an ambassador. I want you to understand not only the privilege, but number two, the purpose. There's a purpose in being an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ. We understand the ambassadors that are sent from our nation to other nations and we can see that physically and understand that application and see how they behave and what they're to do and what their purpose is. And they don't always fulfill it properly and appropriately and what have you, but the reality is they have a purpose. This morning, when we look at the text of Scripture, we understand that we too have a purpose. As he's given to us this distinguished title that we are his ambassadors, we have a purpose. Notice with me in verse 18, the Bible says at the end of the verse, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. Verse 19, to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. And then notice this phrase at the end of verse number 19, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, verse 20, we are ambassadors for Christ. As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. Do you see the number of uses of the word reconcile or some form of the word reconcile in these verses of Scripture that we've read this morning? We see that the ministry, the purpose of being an ambassador is that he's given to us this work of reconciliation. Now here's the amazing thing. I can't personally reconcile anybody. But as an ambassador, I've been given the ministry of reconciliation. Notice with me, specifically in verse number 20, he says now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us. And so listen, the Bible tells us that God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Amen, is that what your Bible says? 2 Peter 3. We could turn over there if we need to. We understand that's what he says. In fact, as he's writing to Timothy, he says that he would have all men to be saved and come unto the kingdom of God. the knowledge of truth. That's God's plan. Now we understand that not all mankind will be saved because we understand they will not be reconciled. There are many that reject him. He came to his own, his own received him not. Is that not what the Bible tells us? We find that there is a great white throne judgment in Revelation chapter 20, and there will be subjects that will stand at that great white throne judgment. Who are those people? Those that were not reconciled to God. Those that were never born again. But we understand this morning that God's heart and God's desire for God so loved the world. He loved the world. He is the propitiation for our sins, but not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. First John chapter two. And we find that it says as though God did beseech you by us, and then notice this, we pray you. It's an interesting word. Sometimes we look at the New Testament and there's obviously a number of Greek words and the English language is somewhat limited, but that word pray literally carries with it the idea of to beseech, to beg. In fact, the same Greek word that we see that's used for pray in this verse, in verse number 20, it's translated 12 times in our English Bible as pray, but it's translated nine times in our English Bible as beseech. Think about this. The apostle Paul says, I beseech you in Romans chapter number 12. What's he saying? I'm pleading with you. I'm begging you. I've laid out the truth that I've laid out and now I'm begging you. I'm pleading with you. And begin to look at this truth this morning and considering the purpose that we have as being an ambassador. Yes, it's a great privilege, but we have a purpose. And it says that we pray you in Christ's stead. In other words, on his behalf, the Lord Jesus Christ, he's seated at the right hand of the throne of glory. We find that he has left us as his ambassadors and so we're his representatives. We're going out on his behalf and we have a purpose. The purpose that we have is not to feed the hungry. The purpose that we have is not to build. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with those things. I'm simply saying that if we only do those things, we've fallen short of what our true purpose is. Because our true purpose is to bring, to do the work of reconciliation. Notice what he says. We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. Why is it that man needs reconciliation? What is it that reconciliation means? It means the act of reconciling parties, notice this, at variance. Why are they at variance? Why does the Bible say that he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation? It's because of sin. See, God didn't do anything wrong, but humanity did. Sin entered into the world in the garden. And death passed upon all men. Amen? We're all sinners for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. We're all sinners. And therefore, every sinner needs reconciliation. Why? He's at enmity. He's at variance with God. God has done everything necessary to provide for reconciliation. There's nothing that any of us can do to add to it. It would show the fact that his offering was not sufficient. He did it all. He did it all. But he's entrusted to us the ministry of reconciliation. See, you know there's a lot of people that we come in contact with on a daily basis that do not know that they need to be reconciled to God. They don't know it. They have no idea. Oh, they might admit that they're a sinner, but they may have been in a position where they've been taught some false thoughts with regard to salvation and how to approach God. And I've heard many people over the years say, especially in their later years, I've made my peace with God. And I've often wondered and I've often asked the question, what do you mean by that? Because the Bible tells us there's only one way to have peace with God. The Bible is very clear with regard to this ministry of reconciliation. And we find that mankind is in need of reconciliation. And God has entrusted to us as his ambassadors, as his representatives, this great privileged title, this distinguished title, the privilege and honor that I can represent the Lord Jesus Christ here on earth, but I have a purpose. And it's the ministry of reconciliation. Turn to the book of Romans, if you will. We're gonna look at a few verses of scripture and kind of hammer in this ministry of reconciliation and what this really looks like and what we must deal with as we consider the purpose that God has given to us. In Romans chapter five, beginning in verse number six, notice what the Bible says. Romans five and verse number six. For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man, some would even dare to die, but God commendeth his love toward us. And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. You know why he died for you? Because you're a sinner. You needed a substitute. And he died for us because he loves us. This is the payment that was made so that the two parties that were at variance could be brought to peace. It tells us in verse number nine, much more than being now justified, how? By your works? No, by his blood. Amen. Is that what it says? How are you gonna be justified? There's only one way to be justified. Only one way to be reconciled. Only one way to be saved. Jesus is the only way. Justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Notice in verse 10, for if when we were enemies, we were, what does it say? Reconciled. Listen, I know sometimes we wanna, I wasn't really an enemy of God. You were an enemy of God. God wasn't your enemy. God wants you to be saved. But we, in our rebellion, in our sin, we were at enmity with God. We were at variance. And we needed to be reconciled. And he says, for when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, how? By the death of his son. Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Hallelujah. Verse 11, and not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. Man, it's good to be reconciled. It is absolutely necessary to be reconciled. Amen? If you're not saved this morning, if you've not been reconciled, if you're still at variance, you've never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior. Listen, chapter number six of the book of 2 Corinthians, today is the day of salvation. We plead with you, we pray, we beseech you in Christ's name, be reconciled to God. You need to be reconciled, because you're at variance. Notice in verse number one of this passage, I didn't read it to start out. I read verses six through 11, but notice verse number one, therefore being justified, we read of that in verse number nine, by his blood, notice by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. He's my peace. I have peace with God. Does it mean I'm perfect? No, but he is. He is. The next verse in 2 Corinthians chapter five that we'll study, probably not next Sunday, but the following Sunday, for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Hallelujah. It's that imputed righteousness. It's not my own righteousness. All of my own righteousness is in filthy rags. It's his righteousness. And I have peace with God. If you're saved this morning, if you've been reconciled, you have peace with God. Ephesians chapter two, notice what the Bible says here in Ephesians chapter two, as we think about this truth of reconciliation. In fact, I wish we could, we actually will. We're gonna back up and start reading in verse number one. It's just so important to see all of this this morning. I'll do my best not to make many comments and just let God's word speak for itself here this morning. In verse number one, the Bible says, and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. I was dead spiritually, but he made me alive. I was born again. We talked about that last week. Verse two, wherein in time past, you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince, the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, aren't you thankful for the but God? But God who is rich in mercy for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sin. hath quickened us together with Christ, by grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them. Notice verse 11. Wherefore remember, remember, remember what? That ye, being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision, in the flesh made by hands, that at that time, notice what it says, ye were without Christ. Can you remember that? Can you remember in your life when you were without Christ? I'm saying before you got saved. See, because being saved is not a process, it's a moment, it's the miracle of a moment. You must be born again, and I remember in time past. I remember when I was without Christ. I remember having no hope. I remember having no peace. I remember having no real joy, because I was without Christ. I remember that. By the way, it's a good thing for us every once in a while to remember what he did for us, where we were headed. A songwriter, I haven't heard the song for years, but he said, speaking of his life, when he was prior to being saved, he was on a road heading to nowhere. Now, the reality is that he was heading to the lake of fire. This morning, we find that he says, you were without Christ, notice, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. In the beginning, I read the whole passage because the reality is that in verse number three, it says that, among whom also we all had our conversation in time past, we were all in the same boat. We were all without hope. We were all without Christ. You weren't born saved. Amen? God has no grandchildren. Amen? Why do we pray that our kids in our junior church, in our Sunday school ministers, why do we pray that they get saved at a young age? Because just having a saved mom and dad doesn't make them saved. Amen? My grandkids are 18 months old and two weeks old, and I've already prayed for their salvation. Why? Because just because their parents are saved and their grandparents are saved and just because their grandfather's a preacher doesn't mean that they're going to heaven. Amen? They need to be saved. He tells us in verse 13, but now. But now. Remember in time past, verse 11, but in verse 13, but now, in Christ Jesus, those that have been ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he, the Lord Jesus Christ, for he is our peace, who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh, notice, the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby. He's provided the way, but he has given to us the ministry of reconciliation. And when we understand the privilege of being an ambassador, and then we understand the purpose of being an ambassador, the purpose is that we are, as he says in verse number 20 of our text of Scripture, that we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God. I'll be very transparent with you this morning. I do my best to help us. God convicted me this week on this truth in verse 20, that we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God. You know why God convicted me this week? I know there are times that all we might be able to do is hand a gospel tract to somebody at a grocery store, at a whatever, it might be all that we can do, but can I tell you this, God convicted me, that's not praying you in Christ's stead that you be reconciled to God. It's not really being an ambassador and pleading with someone. It really isn't. God convicted me this week. I think we should give out gospel tracts. I think we should send out literature. We have things. I've asked you to take them. We use door hangers. We have invitations. We mail things at times, but God didn't call us to be marketing agents. Amen? He didn't call us to be marketing agents. He said you're ambassadors. An ambassador is different than a marketing agent. An ambassador, we pray you, we beseech you, we beg you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. Why? Because I understand if they're not reconciled, they're going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. And I understand that they're at enmity, they're at variance, and God's given to us the opportunity, the privilege of going in and trying to bring these two parties that are at variance. God did nothing wrong. Man sinned, and man needs to be brought back, reconciled, and that's our ministry. That's our ministry. I wonder when's the last time we wept over a soul. I wonder the last time we pled with someone to be saved. I wonder. I examine my own life. Do you have people right now that you're praying for? I asked this question a few weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago now. Time goes so quickly. When's the last time you shared the gospel with someone personally? Not the last time you gave somebody a gospel tract. I think it's good to give gospel tracts. When's the last time you personally shared the gospel with someone personally? God beat me up this week because we are His ambassadors. Man is at variance, at enmity with God, and the only way for them to be reconciled is if those that are true ambassadors that have already been reconciled are engaged in the work, the ministry of reconciliation. The government can't reconcile man to God. And by the way, God didn't give him that responsibility. God instituted government, but God did not give government that responsibility. He gave it to us. We are His ambassadors. And what a privilege that is ours to have that distinguished title, but with it comes a purpose. We pray you, we pray you, plead with you, beg you, beseech you, in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God. I've had someone ask me at various times, I've had people ask this question, why do you care so much if I get saved? And I've said this, listen, I'm going to heaven whether you get saved or not. I'm going to heaven whether someone else gets saved or not, because I've been saved. But I want them to go to heaven. Why? Because I know the alternative. And we've been reconciled and we want others to be reconciled to God to have that peace and He's given to us this ministry of reconciliation. Can I tell you, it's not passive, it's active. It's not passive, it's active. Listen, it's got to be purposed, intentional. I told you about the stranger, Marcel, that we drove with for six hours and 15 minutes from Nashville to Pensacola. If you don't know the story, I'm not going to give it all to you right now because I don't have time, but we were stranded in Nashville and we're going to have a 14-hour layover and so we're going to rent a car and drive. fellow said, can I ride with you? And I said, sure. And Joseph was like, what in the world is going on? And Armando, I promise you, I promise you, it was as if the Holy Spirit of God said that man needs to know the truth of the gospel. I sat in that car, and I'm just going to be transparent with you. I didn't want to bring it up too early in case it was super uncomfortable. You say, Pastor, that's kind of fleshly and carnal. I'm just being honest with you. It was a six-hour drive. But I kept watching that GPS. When it got to about an hour, it's go time. How do we transition? It was purposed. I wish he got saved. He didn't. Jeff brought up somebody in Sunday school a few weeks ago they got to share the gospel with because of a circumstance. I've been praying for that lady by name. He's followed up with her. The prophet of God in the Old Testament wept. Elisha wept. Why? Because he knew the destruction that was going to come. God revealed it to him. Paul wept. He served the Lord night and day with tears. So, what the Bible tells us in Acts chapter 20? He's pleading with people to be reconciled to God. We know God has revealed to us the truth of eternity. There's a lot of dry eyes in 2025. I just wonder, do we really truly understand what it is to be an ambassador? The privilege, the privilege to be the representative of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and the purpose. We pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning. Thank you for reconciling me. Thank you for saving my soul. God, I pray you would help us, help us to be good ambassadors, to recognize the privilege, the purpose. Would you move and work in hearts and lives. If there's one here not sure of heaven, God, I pray they'd be saved by the grace of God. For every child of God, would you help us this morning to be stirred, to be changed. Pray that you'd have your will and way, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano. As she does, the altar's open. If you're not sure of heaven, we'll take a Bible and show you how to know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe God just convicted you this morning. We're going to have a heart, a passion for souls. We're going to be known as ambassadors. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.",
