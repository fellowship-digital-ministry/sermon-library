  "text": "Dealing with great levels of difficulty, of course We understand that after David was used by God and God enabled him to defeat Goliath that of course there were some other battles with the Philistines and David was recognized by several within the the ranks of Israel as being a wise person of course the women were singing his praises and they said something of this nature that Saul had slain his Thousands, but David his ten thousands and of course Saul as the king didn't like that a whole lot and of Saul sought Continually to kill David and so over this portion of Scripture in this section of 1st Samuel you see often where David is fleeing From the dangers of Saul and how God is working miraculously on his behalf And as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening we're gonna look focus for the the main thought of the lesson from verses 16 through 18 and Somebody read that passage and then we'll get into the lesson this evening. The Bible says in Jonathan Saul's son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God And he said unto him fear not For the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over Israel and I shall be next unto thee and that also saw my father knoweth they too made a covenant before the Lord and David abode in the wood and Jonathan went to his house Again, if you will a lesson within a lesson really the thought of 1st Samuel 23 as we look throughout this passage of Scripture You find that it begins with the Philistines attacking the city of Keilah The Bible begins in verse number one and says then they told David saying behold the Philistines fight against Keilah And they robbed the threshing floors And so we find that David is made aware of the situation with the Philistines Attacking the city of Keilah and David inquires of the Lord He seeks the face of God he and his men go to Keilah and they provide deliverance from the Philistines I mean, that's a wonderful passage of Scripture the first five verses I mean you think about the victory that they experienced you think about the The joy that was in that city and amongst those people when they experienced the victory of the Lord and how God's guidance and leadership Gave them the direction that they needed for that particular time, but we find that the Bible tells us that they After they experienced victory that Saul was aware of what was taking place In fact, if you read in verse number seven You find that Saul was going to seize the opportunity if you will To go and get David and we know that he wanted them dead in verse number seven The Bible says and it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah and Saul said God hath delivered him into mine hand For he has shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars So what does Saul do he gathers the people of war together according to verse number eight and they were gonna go down to Keilah to Besiege David and his men. It's interesting that Saul was not the one he and his men they didn't come to help Keilah from the Philistines and We find that it was David and his men that went to the city to help deliver These inhabitants from the attack of the Philistines But now when Saul hears word that David is in this city And he looks at as being a grave mistake for he's shut in He's in a city a town that hath gates and bars And so Saul is going to seize his opportunity to finally get David We find that David inquires of the Lord he asked the Lord two simple questions as We look at the first really twelve verses of this passage of Scripture to really set the scene for what's going on And he asked two questions number one. He asked the Lord is Saul going to come See David had heard that Saul he'd heard about the plan that Saul had devised and that Saul was going to come and so David Inquires and he asked specifically of the Lord is Saul going to come you can read of that in verse number 11 and you find that God answers the specific request notice. It says will the men of Keilah Deliver me into his hand will Saul come down as my servant hath heard and the Bible tells us that the Lord God of Israel Gives an answer at the end of verse number 11. It says the Lord said he will Come down The second question that David asked and really it was posed first in verse number 11 But it's addressed second and the answer is given in verse number 12 And that question was this whether or not the men of Keilah would deliver him and his men into the hand of Saul the Bible says that God answered again at verse number 12 at the end. It says the Lord said they will Deliver thee up now. Can you imagine put yourself just for a moment in the shoes of David? Understand the circumstances that are going on I'm trying to set the scene this evening to help us understand really the condition in which David has found himself He goes and he delivers this city from the Philistines While he's experiencing victory and there's a level of joy. He hears about this plan of Saul he's gathered up the men of war and they're going to come together for the purpose of besieging David as men and David says God is he gonna come and are these people gonna deliver me into his hand and God says yes He's coming and yes, they will deliver you into his hand Now you might have a different expectation of what the inhabitants of Keilah would do for you after you did for them Right. I mean, is that a fair assessment? David and his men they went they fought against the Philistines They're the ones that brought victory to the city of Keilah But yet these men these inhabitants of this town this city Keilah when they find that Saul is coming no, they're gonna deliver David and His men and we find that as we look at the really the main emphasis of the story that rate within the lesson is A lesson that I want to focus on this evening. We've read the verses of Scripture already in verses 16 through 18 Let me read verse 16 again Give you the title and we'll get into the message The Bible says and Jonathan saw son arose and went to David into the wood and strengthened his hand in God I've simply entitled the message this evening Jonathan strengthened David's hand Jonathan strengthened David's hand, you know, the reality is that there are times in which we're all in need of encouragement We're all in need of someone to help strengthen us encourage us And we find that David was in a situation here where he was being hunted In fact, the Bible tells us in verse number 14 of the passage of Scripture that Saul saw him David Everyday, can you imagine? David had earlier made this confession that there was but a step between him and death Saul was serious about his agenda to kill David Dave was in this position And so as we look at the passage and we think about the fact that Jonathan strengthened David's hand I want you to consider just two thoughts this evening. Number one is this Jonathan was aware of the situation Jonathan was aware of the situation The Bible tells us in verse number eight and Saul called all the people together to war To go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men early on We find that Saul tried to keep his motive secret as to what he wanted to do to David we find that early on in 1st Samuel chapter number 18, in fact when Saul has this idea that he was going to send David out to war and thinking that David would fall by one of the hands Of the Philistines when Saul had the idea that he was gonna make David his son-in-law He's gonna give his daughter in marriage he requested of the the dowry if you will and he thought that David would be killed by the Philistines that he would fall by the hand of the Philistines We find that Saul kind of had this secretive agenda If you will early on on his desire to see David killed Of course, we know that he threw the javelin and tried to kill David on more than one occasion in chapter number 19 as you kind of progress through the situation and really think about what Jonathan was aware of we Understand that they had this friendship In fact, let me read a couple of verses before we get into chapter 19 in chapter 18 in verses 1 Really 1 through 4 the Bible says and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul That the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David Jonathan loved him as his own soul and Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house It says this in verse 3 then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to a sword and to His bow bow bow, excuse me and to his girdle We find that as we look at the passage of Scripture We begin to think about this friendship that had been developed over the years between these two men and we find that that Jonathan was aware of the situation for this Is what said in chapter 19 after? those events in chapter 18 when Saul had kept his Agenda his motive secret in verse 19 and verse 1 of chapter 19 It says in Saul spake to Jonathan his son and to all his servants notice this that they should kill David Saul's plan in chapter 18 his secret agenda didn't come to pass and so now Jonathan is made aware of this in fact in chapter 19 Jonathan says to his father what why what has he done I mean you saw how that God used him to provide deliverance in fact in verse number five it says for he did put his life in his hand and slew the Philistine and the Lord brought a great salvation for all Israel thou sawest it and did rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay David without a cause this particular time in verse number six Saul hearkened under the voice of Jonathan and Saul swear as the Lord liveth he shall not be slain so David is brought back into the presence of Saul and shortly thereafter we find that David was playing with his hand in verse number nine and John Saul was there with a javelin in his hand and what did he do in verse number 10 Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin he slipped away out of Saul's presence he's delivered by his wife and we see all sorts of things taking place and it's in chapter number 20 when we find that as David and Jonathan devised this plan as to how he would determine if there was ill set against him that the Bible tells us after their event there they're really their plan that they came up with David of course was not going to be there to eat his place would be empty and the Bible tells us in chapter 20 in verse number 30 that Saul's anger was kindled now against Jonathan the Bible says that he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and under the confusion of thy mother's nakedness for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die Jonathan then answered his father look at what he says in verse 32 he said to him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done so Saul then cast a javelin at Jonathan it says this and Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David so he was aware of the situation chapters 21 and 22 provide us some events in the life of David when he's seeking refuge he is delivered by the priest of Himalaya and of course Doeg one of the servants of Saul was there and he heard about what's going on and in all of the slaughter of the Levites in that passage in his his family and we come to the 23rd chapter and as David is there at Keilah and now the Bible tells us that Saul called all the people together to war he was gonna go down and so this man Jonathan he was aware of the situation he was aware of what was going on he was aware of the plan of his father he was aware of the situation of David no doubt in my mind because of the friendship that had been developed over the years between these two men and their experiences together that the Bible tells us that Jonathan loved David as his own soul so we find that Jonathan has a level of concern and compassion for David we find that he's aware of the situation there are times in our lives where we may be aware of something where someone is going through a difficulty there's some hardship some trial some difficulty that someone is going through and we're aware of the situation being aware of the situation is good but we got to do something about it and that's where we find as we really look at the passage of Scripture we find first of all that he was aware of the situation number two notice this that Jonathan took action to strengthen David he did something about it I want you to consider what's taking place I want to consider with me this evening really the the risk that Jonathan was taking upon his own life I mean in chapter number 20 when he stood before his father Saul and said what has he done we find that Jonathan is the one now that's having a javelin thrown at him so Jonathan is going to go and we find that Saul is seeking David at this particular time because David was diligent to seek counsel from the Lord and he found out that yes all is coming and yes these people are going to deliver you into his hand what did David do they got out the Bible tells us in verse 13 then David is men which were about 600 arose and departed out of Keylon went whithersoever they could go and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keyla and he forbear to go forth and so the Bible tells us in verse number 14 that David abode in the wilderness and strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Zipf and Saul sought him every day but God delivered him not into his hand thank God for his protection and what a blessing that is the Bible says in verse 15 and David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life and David was in the wilderness of Zipf in a wood we find that he's in this place he's being sought teen as men and we find that the Bible tells us in verse 16 and Jonathan Saul's son arose notice what it says and went to David what did he do he went to David in the place where David was the Bible says that he went to David into the wood he found where David was and he went to him David was in a situation here we know later on in the book of 1st Samuel as you would come to the 30th chapter of this book you find that David is in a situation where he returns from the potential of going into battle and he returns to the city of Ziklag and he finds that the Amalekites had come in and had taken captive all of the family and they'd taken everything and David was greatly distressed and there in that passage the Bible tells us that David encouraged himself in the Lord but in this particular occasion in 1st Samuel chapter 23 we find that Jonathan was used of the Lord to come to where David was and to strengthen his hand in God to encourage him I think about the joy that must have filled David's heart and soul at the sight of Jonathan can you imagine we've quickly gone through several chapters of references from chapter 18 through 20 to help us to understand this relationship that had developed between Jonathan and David this friendship this godly friendship and we find that now as David is being hunted and he's going from place to place and he's there in the wood in this wilderness of Zipf what a joy to see the face of Jonathan have you ever seen someone that maybe not seen for a while and man there's just a great sense of joy that fills your heart upon the sight of that individual they're coming for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening you we find that Jonathan comes not only do we notice what he did but we notice what he said in verse number 17 the Bible records for us really this brief encounter that Jonathan has with David this brief opportunity that he has he sees the opportunity to encourage his friend to strengthen his friend notice he says unto him number one fear not fear not now typically you tell someone to fear not because you sense that there might be a sense of fear right I mean if I show up and you look like man everything's going great I mean everything's wonderful and you're enjoying great victory if I greet you by saying fear not you're gonna be like what is he talking about why does he get the idea that I'm afraid right you understand but when we can can you sense when someone's afraid sure you can there are times and situations in which we can see on the countenance of an individual that there is something that has caused them a level of fear there's something that's going on and the Bible tells us as we go through the passages amazing passage of Scripture here in first Samuel 23 but as we look at the lesson within the lesson we think about this moment of time in which Jonathan comes and encourages David the Bible says that he says fear not no notice what he says for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee is it interesting to you how easy it was for Jonathan to find David and yet Saul was not able to find David he saw him in fact as we look through it says that he sought him every day he saw him every day but God delivered him not into his hand what a blessing we find that Jonathan comes and he shows up and he says to David is he's there in his presence he says fear not for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee then he tells him this and thou shalt be king over Israel see Jonathan understood the plan Jonathan understood what God was doing Saul no doubt was aware of it even as Jonathan mentions here at the latter part of verse number 17 that Saul also was aware of this plan remember that it was back before David ever was anointed to be king of Israel that God through Samuel had told Saul that God has rejected you from being king see Saul had been disobedient we find that there's occasion in which he did not wait as he was supposed to he did not obey in the manner in which he was to obey and we find that Samuel had to deliver that message to Saul that He was rejected by God. I do not believe that Samuel enjoyed delivering that message, for the Bible tells us that Samuel mourned for Saul. In fact, as you come to the first verse of 1 Samuel 16, the Bible says, \"...And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul? Seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel. Fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided me a king among his sons.\" Who is that? It's David. And so Jonathan reveals to David, now I want you to understand, a man that's on the run, a man that's been hunted now for a number of chapters as recorded here in the book of 1 Samuel, he's delivered at the end of chapter 18. We find that there's the truth of what Saul's trying to do. He then makes it broadly known in chapter 19, he's delivered by his wife and protected by Samuel. And we find that as you go through chapters 19, 20, 21, 22, that David's on the run. And you find that he says to Jonathan at one particular occasion, there's but a step between me and death. And we think about understanding that's there in 1 Samuel 20 in v. 3, the latter part of the verse, but truly as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, there's but a step between me and death. If you're in that situation, if you're considering the fact that you're being hunted, as you're considering the fact that there's but a step between you and death, the thought of being king of Israel is not really close on your mind. Right? What does Jonathan do? He reminds him of God's promises. He reminds him of God's plan. Jonathan comes to David. He comes to the place where he is. It says that he arose and he went to David into the wood. Strengthened his hand in God. He tells him to fear not. He then tells him that Saul's not going to find him. He reminds him of the plan and promise of God. He says, thou shalt be king over Israel. If God has ordained it that you're going to be king over Israel, and He has, and we know that you've been anointed to be king, you're not king yet, so you know that God is going to protect you. He's going to provide for you. Can you imagine the encouragement? See, there are times in our lives, thinking about the life of Jonathan, but also thinking about the life of David, there are times in our lives when we're in a situation, we're dealing with a level of circumstances and a difficulty in which we might think it's helpless. It's hopeless. We're not thinking properly. We're in a place where we're not thinking properly because of a circumstance, a situation that you're dealing with, and somebody's able to come alongside of you and remind you of some of what God's plan is, some of what God's promises are. It may not be that you have forgotten them entirely or completely, but it's just not fresh on your mind because you're dealing with all of these circumstances and all of these adverse situations that you're dealing with, and you say, I'm overwhelmed with these things. In fact, many of the psalms in which you read where David is crying out and saying, how long, O Lord? When David's crying out and saying that his heart is overwhelmed, many of those psalms are penned during this period of time of the book of 1 Samuel when he's on the run. And I can't help but think about the encouragement of Jonathan in this passage of Scripture. It's a lesson within the lesson. And think about the impact that it made on David's life in this very moment of time. The Bible says in v. 17, \"...and I shall be next unto thee, and that also saw my father knoweth.\" The Bible tells us in v. 18, \"...and they too made a covenant before the Lord, and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.\" Jonathan couldn't stay where David was, but he risked whatever the cost would be, perhaps his life, to go to where David was to encourage him, to strengthen him. As I think about this passage of Scripture and I think about the truth that Jonathan strengthened David's hand, I wonder this evening, whose hand is it that God has for us to strengthen? Who is it that God may allow us to have some knowledge of a circumstance or situation that they're dealing with and God may use us to go and strengthen their hand? That we would take action. See, Jonathan was aware of the situation, but Jonathan took action. He did something about it. He was willing to go into the presence to risk maybe even his own life. Do you think that Saul would have been pleased to know that Jonathan was going to find where David was? No, this is a dangerous situation. Jonathan had already been in the presence of Saul once when Saul took a javelin and threw it at him. We find that Jonathan said, I need to go encourage my friend. I need to go and strengthen his hand in God. He was aware of what was going on. And this situation with David was again, a number of passages of Scripture, chapters that we read of this ongoing drama that David is facing and all of this difficulty that he's dealing with. And we find that he comes and they make this covenant and then David stays there in the wood and Jonathan returns to his house. As I think about this passage of Scripture and think about the role of Jonathan, I'm reminded of what the Bible tells us about Job. Go over to Job 4 if you will. Now, often we think about the book of Job. We think about all of the difficulty that Job encountered and certainly he had some great difficulty. You read there in Job 1 and you read of all the things that befell him and you read into chapter 2 and see how that it continues to just increase. And the Bible tells us that he had some friends at the end of chapter 2 that were going to go and they were going to come and they sought to bring comfort. And of course, we know that later in the book of Job, that Job will describe his friends as being miserable comforters. But I want you to consider what is said of Job in Job 4. In verse 3, it says, Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. Thy words have upheld in him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. Job was a man that was used of God to encourage many. To strengthen them. We see it in verses 3 and 4 here of Job 4. And of course, we find that it goes into the fact that now Job is in that position where he needs the encouragement. He's dealt with some tragedy, some difficulty, and now he needs the encouragement. And no doubt, there are times in our lives where we need encouragement, but this evening as we look at this passage of Scripture and we consider what's going on in the life of David, and we say, thank the Lord that Jonathan was sensitive to the need and Jonathan was willing to take action and go and strengthen the hand of David. And I just wonder this evening, I think about the New Testament. I think about many throughout the portions of Scripture that were used to be encouragers. Barnabas is probably one of the first examples that would come to our mind as one that was an encourager. No doubt, he encouraged Paul on a number of occasions. We find that as we would look throughout the Scriptures and we think about those that came and there were several that Paul would mention how they refreshed me. They oft refreshed me and how these individuals were used by the Lord to go and to seek him out, to seek to encourage him and to strengthen him. This evening, David was in a difficult situation. God delivered him just as Jonathan had given him the encouragement. God worked miraculously. If you read the end of 1 Samuel 23, you find that just as David and his men are completely surrounded by Saul and his men, that the Bible tells us that there came a messenger to Saul and said the Philistines have invaded the land and we find that Saul and his men have to retreat and go take care of that and God miraculously delivers David and his men. And what a blessing. But in the midst of the trial, Jonathan comes and strengthened his hand in God. This evening, is there someone that God might want you to encourage, to strengthen? Are we looking for that opportunity? No doubt there are times you say, pastor, I hear what you're saying, but I'm the one that needs encouragement. Sometimes it's easy for us to look at things that way. Amen? We're all dealing with difficulties and I'm not trying to discount those difficulties. I'm simply saying that God could use you to be an encouragement to someone else, to strengthen someone else. their truth from His Word, to be able to strengthen their faith to continue on. I can only imagine how David must have felt at the sight of Jonathan. I'm sure it was refreshing. It was encouraging. Just him coming. And then as they sat there and they talked and Jonathan shared these truths, reminded David, God has a plan for you, David. You're going to be the king. We find that David was strengthened by Jonathan. Oh, that God would use us in like fashion. Let's pray. Father, we love You this evening. We thank You for loving us. Lord, we thank You for the encouragement that You give us through Thy Word. We thank You for the examples that we're able to read of. We believe in this particular account here this evening of Jonathan being aware of the situation, but then taking action to go to where David was to speak to him, to encourage him, to strengthen him. God, this evening, I pray, You'd help us to be sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Spirit of God in our lives. Help us, God, to be used of Thee. Help us to encourage and strengthen the brethren. I pray that You would bless our time of prayer. We thank You for the privilege of prayer. We pray that You'd be honored and glorified through all that's said and done. For it's in Christ's name we pray, Amen.",
