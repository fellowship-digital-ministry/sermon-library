  "text": "for the opportunity to preach through the book of Colossians here in this calendar year. And I have been encouraged and strengthened, and what a blessing to have the Word of God. Amen. And it's interesting, I was sharing with someone just this morning, and had been sharing with my family earlier in the week, how that when you look at these truths in the Word of God, how applicable they still are for today. And we understand that the Word of God is the living Word of God, and it's written by the eternal God, and therefore it is relevant for every people group. It's relevant in every era of human history. And there are some that think that the Bible is outdated, it needs to be updated, or whatever. They'll say, well, it's not relevant. It is so relevant. And we find that as we dig into the Word of God, that God will give us truth that is applicable and relevant in the day in which we are living. If it were true in Paul's day and Peter's day, and we know that it is, that there were false teachers that were active, we would say assuredly this morning that false teachers continue to be prevalent. We understand that as we look at the passage of Scripture, as we look at the end of chapter number one of the book of Colossians and then get into chapter two, we find that the apostle Paul had shared with these believers in Colossae, and we've studied it, how that really the philosophy of his ministry. What was the ministry that God had placed him in, that God had called him to? It was to preach Christ, it was to warn every man, and it was to teach every man for the express purpose of being able to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. What a great summarized statement of the ministry. Not only the aspects of ministry, but the purpose of ministry. As we studied last week, and you look at the first few verses of Colossians 2, we find that Paul then is revealing to these believers in Colossae about this great conflict that he has, not only for the believers in Colossae, but for those in Laodicea and for all of them that had not seen his face in the flesh. And as we studied last week and we dealt with that great conflict, we said we understood that Paul had such great concern and care for these believers that the way in which he described that care and concern was a great conflict. What was it that caused this great conflict in the life of the Apostle Paul? Nothing other than these false teachers that were active, not only in Colossae, but we find in Laodicea and in many other regions in which the gospel had gone forth. And Paul has this great conflict and he desires to warn these believers in Colossae. We, of course, understand as he summarized the ministry to preach Christ, warning every man and teaching every man, and we find that the Bible tells us this in Psalm 19 and verse number 11, \"...moreover by them,\" by the Scriptures, the law of the Lord is what is being referred to in that portion of Scripture. He says this, \"...moreover by them is thy servant warned, and in keeping of them,\" the Scriptures, \"...there is great reward.\" We looked a couple of weeks ago at the truth in 1 Corinthians 4 and verse number 14 when Paul said, \"...I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons, I warn you.\" I warn you. He's giving, extending this warning in order to protect these believers from these false teachers and from this teaching that is going forward, and we find that then, after giving a warning, he seeks to teach every man. Why is it that he's seeking to teach? Well, as we said last week, spiritual growth is the most effective defense against false teaching. I mean, when you know what the Word of God says, when you have been settled and grounded in the faith, when you've grown spiritually, not that you ever come to a place of arrival because we'll find even as we study through the text this morning, it is a continual process of growth, of spiritual growth, that when you are growing spiritually, you are able to defend the truth of the Word of God and the false teachers, their teaching and their philosophies just kind of fade away under the truth of the Word of God. We find that it was there that Peter said in Acts 6, dealing with some of the things that were taking place there at the church in Jerusalem. He speaks about him and the others, that they would give themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. I'm thankful that God has given us the Word of God, and I'm thankful that He has instructed us to teach and preach the Word of God, and what a blessing it is for us to have the Word of God. This morning we'll be looking at Colossians 2, verses 4 through 7. The Bible says this, And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. If you're taking notes this morning, I've titled the message from verse 7, rooted and built up in Christ. Rooted and built up in Christ. This is a great declaration with a great passage of Scripture, and as we study through it this morning, I want you to take note, number one, note how Paul cautions these believers. Again, we mentioned that in chapter number one, when he describes the ministry that God had called him to, he says, Warning every man. And we find that in verse number four, Paul is going to begin this aspect of ministry of issuing a warning, cautioning the people of God. We find that the truth that is really started in verse number four will continue and be more developed even in verse number eight, as we'll study next Sunday morning. But we find that this danger that Paul is dealing with and the caution that he's giving to these believers is exposed in verse number four. He's exposing the tactic of the enemy. He's dealing with what they need to be careful of and how they need to be cautioned. We've often mentioned throughout the last several weeks how that we have grown accustomed as human beings of receiving warnings, of receiving caution. And we see it on various items that we purchase, the various places that we go, caution, and you'll see warning. And those things are there to grab our attention and to help us take heed. In fact, in verse number eight, it's not really, we're going to look at it in its entirety next Sunday morning, but the verse begins with this wonderful word, beware. Now when you see the word beware, you should take heed. I mean, it gets your attention, amen? And I remember as a child and even still today, if I'm out door knocking and visiting in the neighborhoods and there's a fence and there's a sign that says beware of dog, I am taking literally that warning that is posted on that fence. Why? Because I've gone into gates before and there's been a big dog that's come around the corner and so therefore I'm taking heed to the warning and often what I will do is I will take that gospel tract or that John and Romans and I will twist it up and stick it in the fence and say, I hope they'll grab it and read it. That's just what I do. Why? Because there's a warning that's given. There's certain things that you keep away from your children, chemicals that perhaps you clean with. There are warning labels on those things. There are cautions. And so here Paul is going to issue a caution to these believers in Colossae and as he's issuing this warning, you understand that Paul is seeking to help these believers. He loves them. He's not warning them so that they would forsake truth and follow him. No, he's warning them because the deceivers, the false teachers are active among them and Paul loves them and Paul wants to give them the truth. This here in this passage of Scripture, you notice that he begins in verse number 70 and says, and this I say. Why is he saying this? Well remember in the previous passage that we studied last week, he says I have this great conflict for you and therefore because of this great conflict that I have and we understood as we studied the passage and looked at the whole really of the message of the book of Colossians that it was these false teachers that resulted in Paul having this great conflict. He says therefore I'm saying this to you, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. That word beguile and it carries with it the idea of deception by false reasoning. Deception by false reasoning. And he says this, he uses this phraseology with enticing words. You know the reality is that if they would teach the truth of the word of God, they're not going to beguile you. But they have to use these enticing words in order to beguile you. Why? This deception by false reasoning. And these enticing words are speech words that are adapted to persuade. It's specious discourse leading others into error. That's what enticing words. That's the idea of this truth that Paul is giving to these believers in Colossae. And so he's telling them, listen, I want you to understand the way in which these false teachers are going to operate. They're going to come in and they're going to seek to beguile you with these enticing words. It's not something that's just captured in the book of Colossians. I want you to hold your place here and look over to the book of 1 Timothy if you will. We'll look at a few verses here this morning. In 1 Timothy 4, we'll see this truth given here that Paul is instructing Timothy, his son in the faith. And we understand if we could use the analogy this morning that in a spiritual type of a manner, the Apostle Paul is seeking to pass the baton to Timothy. He understood that Timothy was his son in the faith. He understood that God had called Timothy and commissioned Timothy, and Timothy was like-minded. And so in the book of 1 and 2 Timothy, Paul is investing in instructing Timothy to take the next leg of the race, so to speak. And in 1 Timothy 4, the Bible says this, Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth, for every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified by the Word of God in prayer. And I want you to notice, so Paul is instructing, he's giving Timothy really a warning here and an understanding of what's going to happen. And then notice the charge that is issued in verse 6. If thou, Timothy, if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. In the book of Titus, you turn over just a few pages, and you find in the book of Titus, again, Paul will refer to Titus as being a son in the faith, and we find that Titus again is given this responsibility to go into Crete, and we find that as he would go there, that he would set things in order that were wanting. He was to ordain elders in every city, and Titus had a responsibility. And Paul is seeking to instruct Titus and to help Titus to understand. And throughout the book of Titus, you will find a number of references to this terminology, sound doctrine. Sound doctrine. Understanding the truth of the Word of God. Notice what he says in Titus 1. In v. 10. Let me read v. 9 with it. \"...holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision.\" That referring to the Jews, we understand that terminology throughout the New Testament. And if you look and you understand really contextually what's happening throughout the New Testament era and the propagating of the truth of the gospel, remember in Acts 15, they had to have a meeting, a council at Jerusalem, as it would be referred to. Why? Because there were some Jewish people that were saying to the Gentiles, unless you're baptized, excuse me, circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved. Well, that's not true. Paul deals with it extensively in the book of Galatians. And here we find that as he's instructing Titus, he's saying, listen, there are going to be people that come that are vain talkers and deceivers. What is Paul saying to these believers in Colossae? He's saying, listen, I'm writing to you, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. Peter says this in 2 Peter 2. In 2 Peter 2 verses 1-3, I've referenced this portion of Scripture, but we'll read all three verses here this morning. The Bible says this, Peter says in verse number one of 2 Peter 2, but there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And look at what it says in verse two. And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of, and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not. The feigned words are false words. Here in Colossians 2, he says with enticing words. And we find that the Bible tells us that many shall follow their pernicious ways. Listen, that's a sad reality. These false teachers, they gain a following. Why? Through their false teaching, through their enticing words, through their speech that is adapted to persuade. Leading others into error. And we find that Paul is issuing this caution to the believers in Colossae that they would understand that these false teachers are among them. It's one thing to understand that there are false teachers among us, but it's another thing to understand how they operate. And so Paul is seeking to not simply announce to the believers in Colossae that there are false teachers, but to take it a step further and say here's how they operate. Here's what they're seeking to do. They want to beguile you. They want to deceive you to use this deception by false reasoning. Now, I don't like being deceived. Do you? Have you ever been deceived? You've ever been lied to? It bothers you. I don't want to be lied to. I don't want to be deceived. We find that they will, these false teachers, their seeking, their goal is to beguile you. Can you see the contrast between what Paul said to the believers in Colossae in chapter 1? What was the goal of his ministry? To present you perfect in Christ Jesus. You couldn't be more opposite. Paul says I'm preaching Christ. I'm warning every man. I'm teaching every man so that we might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. But these false teachers, they're seeking to beguile you. To deceive you by error. By false reasoning. We find that it's so important that the people of God today, we need wisdom and we need discernment. Oh, how we need discernment. Paul says this, I believe that the Apostle Paul wrote the book of Hebrews and in Hebrews 5, you don't need to turn there, but in verse number 14, really we don't have the time to look at verses 11 through 14, but we find that they were not growing as they should be growing. They should have been teachers, but the Bible says they were dull of hearing. And here's what Paul says in Hebrews 5 in verse number 14, but strong me belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. You understand this morning that a false teacher doesn't show up on your doorstep. A false teacher doesn't come sit at your table. A false teacher doesn't come through the doors of this congregation and say, just so everyone knows I'm a false teacher. I mean, it'd be really easy if they did that. Just so you know, I'm here to beguile you. No, they don't do that. They don't do that. That's not how they operate. And we need discernment. Oh, how we need discernment. This morning as we think about the passage of Scripture and we speak about the way in which it's relative in our world today, we're dealing with false teachers today that are so prevalent. We made the statement last week, I made the statement that we think about false teachers that they are persistent and they are persuasive. And they are. That's how they work. They'll keep, if they see that there's an opportunity, if they see that there's some progress that they have been able to make, they're going to be persistent. And oh, how they're persuasive. And Paul says, I want to caution you. It's interesting. They'll change words. We've mentioned before how that they will use our vocabulary, but not our dictionary. They'll use a terminology that perhaps we're familiar with, but they mean something entirely different. It's important that we ask the question, what do you mean by that? Someone I gave a gospel track to just recently, and they said, oh, I'm a Christian. What does that mean? How did you become a Christian? Can you explain that? that to me? Because the reality is that it's easy to say I'm a Christian. What does it mean? Has there been a time in your life that you were born again, that you recognize you're a sinner and needed the Savior, and that Jesus is the only Savior? Have you been born again? You understand. I gave a gospel tract to someone yesterday. He said, Catholic? No, sir. A follower of Jesus Christ. And he said, oh. But the reality is that they'll use our vocabulary, a different dictionary, but then they'll do this. They'll change this book. They will change this book. This book is authoritative. This is the Word of God, and it is this book that must alter the behavior and the belief of any child of God. We do not come up with our own ideas, with our own thoughts, and say, well, we'll just change the Bible. No, no. It doesn't work that way. The Bible changes us. Amen? Because the Bible is the Word of God for all scriptures given by inspiration of God. It's not for me to change it. It's not for me to alter it. It's not for me to say, well, it really doesn't mean this, or it doesn't mean that. Listen, if somebody has to start being real creative in their explanation of the Word of God, I'd be careful. The plain sense of the text of Scripture, that's why it's important to, and you'll see through some of you that have been here for the the duration of me pastoring here, some that are newer, I preach expository messages almost extensively only. Why? Because we want to get the Word of God in context. I'm trying to cherry-pick a verse from here and there and make it say something that it really doesn't say. He cautions them. I want you to notice, not only back in Colossians 2 do we find that Paul cautions them, but I want you to know how Paul commends them. In verse number 5, we find that Paul is extending to them this commendation. He is commending them, and it's interesting. He begins by saying this in verse number 5, For though I be absent in the flesh, we understand, we've made it clear throughout our study of the book of Colossians, that Paul has never met these people in the flesh. They've never met him. He heard about these believers through Epaphras. The Bible reveals that to us in chapter number 1. We know that there was a relationship between Paul and Epaphras, and we find that Epaphras was the spiritual leader at the church at Colossae, and it was through this man that Paul understands the things that are taking place in Colossae. This man brought back a report. You'll remember in the book of 1 Thessalonians that Paul shares with the believers in Thessalonica how that he couldn't go back to Thessalonica. He administered there for a period of time, but he had to depart, and he wanted to know their estate, so he sent Timothy, and he sends Timothy to Thessalonica to get an update, to get a report of how they're doing, and Timothy brings that back. That's how Paul understood things that were going on there in Thessalonica. In Colossae, he understands these things through Epaphras, and he says, though we're separated by distance, I've not seen you, I'm absent in the flesh, notice what he says, yet am I with you in the Spirit. Then notice this next word in verse number 5, joying, joying, and beholding your order, though he was separated from these believers by distance, yet he is joying. The word means to rejoice greatly. Now, can you see Paul? He's in prison, right? He's writing the book of Colossians from prison, and when he hears about these believers in Colossae, when he receives this report from Epaphras, and he hears about what's going on, and as he's praying for them, remember he says in chapter 1, I'm praying for you always. He's praying, and he's thanking God for them, and he's praying they would understand the truth, and he's seeking the minister, and as he's writing this letter that we refer to as the book of Colossians, he says that he's joying. I wish in my mind's eye I can see it, but I wish, oh, how wonderful it would be to see the spirit of Paul in that prison cell. He's rejoicing greatly. Paul, you're in prison. Yeah, but I'm thinking about those believers over in Colossae, and oh, how excited he was to hear, oh, he was troubled by the false teachers that were active, but he was excited about the report that he received, and he says this, that he was beholding your order. It's really the first reason, if you will, for which Paul was joying, that he was rejoicing greatly, and he says he's beholding your order. The idea of this phraseology really is a military idea. It really carries with it the idea of an orderly and organized army. Now think about that. We sing songs about the Lord's army, a Christian soldier. We understand that Paul says, and as he's writing again to Timothy in 2nd Timothy chapter number 2, that to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and Paul is looking at this church in Colossae through his spiritual understanding and that which Epaphras has brought to him, and he says, I'm beholding your order. You're like an organized army. I like the imagery. I like the use of the words and the understanding within the context of the language, and they would have understood exactly what it was that Paul was sharing with them. He says not only am I beholding your order, but he says this at the end of verse number 5, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. By the way, your faith is only as good as the object of your faith. He says the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. I spoke with someone this week extensively, and I spoke to them about salvation being by grace through faith, and he said, well I have faith, and I said, I understand that you have faith, but what is your faith in? He began to give me an answer, and I said, listen, your faith is only as good as the object of your faith. Who's your faith in? He says the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. The word steadfastness carries with it the idea of firmness. As believers, we're to have the steadfastness of our faith in Christ, that we understand that Jesus gave the instruction to the disciples before he ascended to heaven, not only to go and preach the gospel to every creature, baptize them, and to teach them all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and that we would have this steadfastness. When you think about faith, really the idea here, the body of doctrine and truth by which we hold dear as the people of God. Jude commends those that he's writing to, that they are to contend for the faith. So Paul, as he has received this report from these, or from Epaphras with regard to these believers in Colossae, he really likens these believers to an orderly army of disciplined soldiers that are making a solid front against the enemy. I like the imagery. You think about the Roman soldiers, and the Roman Empire, and the advancement, and really the understanding that these people would have had about that Roman army, and how they would enter into battle. Listen, if you're gonna go into battle, you don't go in all kind of confused, and man, some people are going over there, and some over here, and some over here, and we're all disorderly. Man, that's a recipe for disaster. Remember, as we studied last week in the first few verses of Colossians chapter number two, he spoke about the fact that they would be knit together in love, and we spoke about unity. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit is what he says to the believers in Ephesus, and we find that Paul is saying, I am rejoicing greatly, and he issues to these believers, he commends them for their order, and for their steadfastness, or the steadfastness of their faith in Christ. We find that he cautions them, we note that he commends them, and then number three this morning, we note how Paul challenges them. Here's the wonderful thing, as though Paul was rejoicing because of their order, and their steadfastness, or the steadfastness of their faith in Christ, Paul understood that he had to issue this challenge, that they did not get comfortable where they were, that they did not just sit by and stagnate. See, the reality is that in the Christian life, we must continue to march forward. We need to be careful about becoming apathetic, indifferent. Apathy is so dangerous. We can come to a place where we feel like I've kind of gone as far as I think I need to go. Oh, beware. Be careful. It's interesting, in like fashion, Paul extends a challenge to the believers in Thessalonica when he's speaking to them about brotherly love, and he says, I know that you do it, but I'm challenging you to abound more and more. Don't get comfortable. Press on. Hebrews 6 has the idea, you don't need to turn there, but in Hebrews chapter number six, right after we read that passage in chapter number five about their dull of hearing in the There's a need for them to grow in their faith, in their walk with God. He tells them, let us go on unto perfection. Remember, Paul is seeking through the teaching of the Word of God to present these believers perfect in Christ Jesus. And so how does Paul challenge these believers in Colossae? How is it that Colossians 2 would challenge me, would challenge you this morning in verses 6 and 7? What is the challenge for us? We receive the caution. We understand there are false teachers around. Listen, they're prevalent. I've been dealing with things in recent weeks that are so very relevant to this subject of false teachers. It's prevalent in our day. We need to be cautioned. Oh, it's good that we have the Bible. It's good that you're in church. It's good that you have sought to grow spiritually. But we find this challenge that is being issued to these believers, and I believe to us this morning as well, notice when he issues this challenge, it's regarding their walk in v. 6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him. It's interesting as you look at the truth in the book of Galatians and you understand how those people were led astray. And you can read through it in Galatians 1. And they began in the faith and they're going to continue in the flesh. And Paul is really issuing this state of confusion, if you will. How is it that you begin this way and then you try to go on this way? And we find that Paul is saying to these believers, and the Word of God is saying to us this morning, as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, this morning, if you've been born again, you've trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, if I were to ask you this morning, are you 100% sure that heaven is your home? I asked a man that question this week and he said, if you put it that way, I mean, he kind of did that number. And I said, well, I'm not interested in knowing if you're 95% sure. It's not good enough. Well, how could anyone know? I'm glad you asked. Let me show you what the Word of God says. We find, look, there's a stink bug, man. I saw all you guys looking at it and it got my attention, amen. As long as that thing stays there, Juliana will be happy. But if that thing goes down there, you guys are in for a treat, amen. And as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, if you've been saved, you've trusted Christ as your Savior, notice what Paul says, so walk ye in him. This truth of having a walk with the Lord, this truth of having communion with the Lord, what a blessing. And what a unique opportunity that we have to walk with God, to commune with Him. I don't know how many of you are reading the daily devotional that we distributed to you this year, but we distributed a daily devotional. If you didn't get it and you want one, we have plenty of other copies, but it's called A Daily Word. And if you read the devotional thought from Friday evening, it went through and it went through all of these things that you're going to do in your lifetime if you add all the minutes together. Did anyone read it? Okay, some of you read it. And it's kind of interesting. It was March 5th. I'm going to go ahead and just read some of it. And here's what it talks about. It says this, the average American will spend six months sitting at stoplights. And Julianna and Brianna said, what? Every minute they add up, right? And you go through and you look through and it talks about five years waiting in line. And I said, yep, that's probably going to be a little bit longer for me because I always find the long lines to wait in. And you ever do that at the grocery store? You think, man, there's only one person here. We're in shape. And then they're like, no, I don't want that. And I don't want this. And I think I'm, yeah. And then it says that you're going to spend one year looking for misplaced objects. Some of you say, no, that's very underestimated, right? I'm going to spend a lot more than one year looking for misplaced objects. But anyway, it goes on. It says this, you're going to eat. You're going to spend six years eating. Yeah, I like that. You had all those minutes up. But then it says this, what would the number be if you added up all the time you have spent with God so far in your life? If you didn't read it, I'd recommend you read it. Honestly, it's convicting. How long do you spend with God? We spend all this time doing all these other things. And here's what the excuse is that most people use. I just don't have time. You have the same amount of minutes today that anybody else living has. It's how we use our time. It's how we use our time. And the reality, and I'm not sure of the study that was behind all of that, but I know that there are several things you can Google and see how many minutes the average person per day spends on this and the average lifespan, and just calculate it out. I think it said six years eating, and we calculated as a family last night that if you spent one hour with God a day for 50 years, it would equate to two years. So we're gonna spend four times, three times, excuse me, as more time eating than we are walking with God, if you spend an hour a day. Can I tell you this morning, most people don't spend an hour a day with God. We just don't. And what I'm saying is that he says here, as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. Continue this, listen, salvation is more than just a fire insurance policy. It's more than just keeping you out of the lake of fire. We get to commune with the God of the universe. We get to walk with him. Jesus says this in John chapter number 10, I've come to give you life and that you might have it more abundantly. Man, the abundant life in Christ, it comes through our fellowship and our walk with him. And as we walk with him, guess what? We're less likely to be beguiled with enticing words. Why? Because I'm walking with him. If somebody brings something and says, well, this, that, and the other thing, it's like, well, actually the Bible says right over here. Let me share this with you. Somebody asked me this week, is that just something that you assume or is that really what the Bible says? That's a great question, by the way. It's a valid question. Because the reality is that we say that the Word of God is the sole authority for faith and practice. So if you believe something and you say something, you better have some Scriptures to back it up. And if you have some Scriptures to back it up, don't listen to what some false teacher says. He challenges them with regard to their walk. Listen, if you're saved, if you've received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him. Notice verse number seven, regarding their growth. We understand the two are related one to the other. He says in verse number seven, rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith. Let's look at these three references and uses of these words that Paul uses. Number one, he references really an agricultural type of a word when he says rooted. Rooted. Rooted in Christ. You think about a plant that is rooted. Have you ever tried to get some weeds out of the garden? And man, those things got a root this long and you say, what in the world? We're rooted in Christ. Here's the question, are we a mighty oak? Or a tumbleweed? How many of you know what tumbleweed is? How many of y'all have driven in the West Coast and you've seen tumbleweed? Driving in the state of Nevada, very limited number of people in the state of Nevada. Little pockets of people all over, but you could literally, we have spent time when I lived in Nevada, I could drive for three or four hours and never see another human being. You can't do that. You can't drive three or four seconds in Northern Virginia. Amen? I'm being serious. You can drive hours. I mean, if you break down, you're in trouble, man. It's a desolate place. You had to be more careful of the farmers that had their fence break that the cow was on the middle of the road. Or the tumbleweed that would regularly blow out in the middle of the road. You're driving 70, 75 miles an hour and those tumbleweed come blowing across the road. It's a dangerous situation. Why do they blow around so easily? They're not rooted. They're not rooted. And so Paul uses this agricultural analogy, if you will, and he says that we're to be rooted in Christ. And then he uses an architectural analogy when he says built up. So you think about this being rooted in Christ, being firm, having the idea of being thoroughly grounded. Remember, the Bible says this in 2 Timothy chapter number three, when the word of God talks about the scriptures being given by inspiration of God, that they're profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly firm. unto all good works. We find that if you were to read Psalm 1, and you read about the blessed man, that's a picture of someone that is grounded. And he's firm. And then he uses this architectural analogy of being built up. This idea of a constant increase in Christian knowledge. The fact that we're continuing to build upon the teaching of the Word of God. Not looking for other teaching. Not looking for some kind of new teaching. But seeking to know this book. You know, if you read your Bible today, and you read that same passage of Scripture a month ago, a year ago, a couple of years ago, God probably used that passage today in your life different than He did before. Is it because it's a different passage? No. It's because you have different circumstances today than you did the last time you read it. And God will reveal something to you in that passage that perhaps you had not seen before. As a pastor, as a preacher of the Word of God, I preach multiple times a week. I'm talking to people all the time. And there are times that I will preach a message from a passage of Scripture, and later that week, I will in my personal devotions read that same passage of Scripture and say, man, I wish I had seen that before I preached. Because that was really good. Why didn't I see that? It's a living book. And we just continue to build up. He says rooted. That agricultural analogy of being rooted in Christ. That firmness being thoroughly grounded. The idea of being built up. The architectural analogy of a constant increase in Christian knowledge. And then He says established. Notice back in Colossians 2 and verse 7. Rooted and built up in Him. We've said in Christ. We understand that Him is referring to Christ. We understand that contextually. And so we want to be rooted and built up in Christ. And then He says established in the faith. Established. Make firm. Having something that is established. It's not gonna waver. It's not gonna change. You understand today that our world is changing? Amen? It's changing so much, they don't even know what's going on. I'm being honest. Our world has lost its mind. That's what happens when you get rid of truth. When you set truth aside, anything goes. The cancel culture that we're living in, those people that are canceling somebody else today, they're gonna be canceled tomorrow. It's all relativism. But we got this book. That's truth. And we're established in it. Listen, I'm not mad at somebody because they disagree with what I believe. I'm really not. But I'm not gonna be swayed to believe what they believe just because there's some pressure. Because I wanna please Christ. I wanna please God. And so we have to be established. Established in the faith. Look at what He says. As ye have been taught. As ye have been taught. And I believe that's important. We go back to Colossians one and we dealt with this on our very first message on the book of Colossians when he, Paul, is addressing these believers and he's speaking about how they were giving thanks and rejoicing for them, praying for them. He says in verse number seven, as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ. These people in Colossae, these believers, they had been taught. And Paul says, as he's writing to them and he's challenging them with regard to their walk, with regard to their growth, he says being rooted and built up in him, established in the faith as ye have been taught. Don't go looking for some other sources. You've been taught by a good minister, a faithful minister. And therefore, listen, I know I dealt with this so I don't wanna repeat all of it, but what's a faithful minister? What's a good minister? Someone that teaches the book. Feed the flock of God, that's the responsibility of the pastor, the truth in 1 Peter chapter number five. And we desire in our church through the ministry that God has given me to teach the word of God. Not my opinions, not my ideas, but to teach the word of God, to teach the truth. And we find that he says, as ye have been taught, notice this truth in 2 Timothy chapter number two. We used to have these words on our hallway as you would walk down the stairs to the Sunday school classrooms. We painted and therefore those words are no longer there, but we need to get those reprinted so that we can put them on the wall again. But in 2 Timothy chapter number two and verse number two, the Bible says this, let me read verse number one with it. Thou therefore my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. In the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, notice these two words, the same, the same. Commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. The same, why? Because truth doesn't change, right? Paul says, I've given you this truth, Timothy. I have given you the truth, I have taught you, it's been among many witnesses and you now, Timothy, take the same, the same body of truth and teach others. Again, as I mentioned earlier, as we looked at 1 Timothy chapter number four, Paul is, if you can think of it this way, he's passing the baton. In 2 Timothy chapter number four, Paul says, look, the time of my departure is at hand. So who's going to run the next leg of the race? Paul says, Timothy, the same things that I've taught you, the same, commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. The truth of the Word of God. The people in Colossae, the false teachers, they were looking for some new truth. There is no new truth. We have the full canon of Scripture. We have the whole Bible. We're not looking for new revelation. We just need to study the book that God's given us. Amen? People so busy looking for something new, they haven't even read this. Honestly. Colossians chapter number two, notice what he says. Think about this truth, when he says, as you have been taught, and then he says this, abounding therein. Abounding therein. With thanksgiving, this idea of abounding, really you get this idea, if I could use the analogy of maybe a river, and abounding would not be a trickling stream, but a mighty river. Abounding therein with thanksgiving. So Paul, as he is going to challenge them, he challenges them with regard to their walk, with regard to their growth, and with regard to their thanksgiving. To their gratitude. With regard to their gratitude. He says, with thanksgiving. You know, this morning, it would be helpful for us as the people of God, just as it would have been helpful for these believers in Colossae, to thank God for truth. You know how blessed you are to have a Bible? Honestly. Really, I can't honestly say without thinking, because oftentimes I think about it just because of how I have understood other parts of the world, and have come to understand that. But most times, we will say, as a preacher of the word of God, take your Bibles and turn to. It's just kind of a habit kind of thing. Why? Well, number one, because I'm preaching from the Bible. I'm not just giving you my thoughts or ideas. Number two, because you have a Bible, and therefore you can turn to the Bible. There are people groups all across this globe that do not have the word of God. We send missionaries to places in which they do not have members of a congregation that have their own Bible that they can take home with them. All over the globe. But you have a Bible. Are you thankful for it? I mean, he says this in Colossians 2. He says, with thanksgiving, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Listen, we need to be thankful. We preach this passage of scripture in Hebrews 13 at the end of last year about some 10 things to rejoice. It's a two-part series. One of those things was rejoicing, not only in truth, but rejoicing for spiritual leaders. Someone that would stand up and preach the Bible. We live in a time and a day and age that there's not a whole lot. I mean, there are people that are preaching. Thankfully, there are faithful preachers of the word of God. But you understand that you can find a lot of places around this country in America where you're hard-pressed to find a faithful church that preaches the word of God. That's sad. It's sad. So Paul is saying to these believers, how's your gratitude? Every day, are you thanking God for the spiritual blessings? Are you thanking Him because you have a Bible? Oh, how blessed we are to have the word of God, that I can go to the Bible. Listen, when you need direction, you seek the face of God through His word. It's a lamp unto our feet. It's the word of God that helps us to grow and be established. And so Paul says, listen, I want to caution you. I want you to understand not only are the false teachers active, but here's how they work. Here's how they operate. When you know how the false teacher operates, it gives you an advantage. It really does. To defend against it. To understand, what do I need to do? Okay, if they're active and this is how they operate, they're going to seek to beguile me with enticing words, therefore I must be rooted and I must be built up in Christ Jesus. Why? Because that's the defense. I'm not going to be beguiled. I'm not going to be deceived because I've been established in the faith. I have grown spiritually. So after he he cautions them, he commends them, and then he challenges them. For us this morning, I wonder how is our how's our walk with God? As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. If we're to add up all the time in this last week, in this last month, in 2021, that we've spent with God, how many hours would it equal? That's not a question that I want you to answer me. I want you to ask yourself, how's my walk with God? Are we growing spiritually? I'll say this, if you're not walking with God, your spiritual growth probably isn't that great because our spiritual growth is the the outflow, the result of our walk with him. Are we growing? Are we thankful? Thankful for truth. Thankful that God would, I mean, the privilege that is ours to have the truth. What a joy. It comes with great responsibility. But this morning, I hope that as we look at this passage and we see how Paul was addressing these believers in Colossae, that we would find that it's for us today in 2021. It's for you. It's for me. That we would receive the word of caution. Oh, it's good to receive commendation, but let's not get stuck on the commendation. Let's look at the challenge as well, that we continue to grow, to develop in our walk with Christ. Because the false teachers, they're active. They're active. And they're seeking to beguile you, to deceive you. So they're seeking to do. You say, no, absolutely. Satan doesn't want you to serve God. And if you're saved this morning, he'll do everything he can to keep you from serving God. If you're lost, you've never trusted Christ as your Savior, he'll bring plenty of false teachers into your life to keep you from trusting Christ. How do we know that? 2 Corinthians 4. The God of this world has blinded the minds of them that would believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel should shine in unto them. How does he do that? False teaching. It's what he does. It's how he operates. I'm so thankful for the Word of God. I hope this morning that we'd receive a challenge just as these believers in Colossae received. Shall we pray? Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the truth that you've given us and thy word for this portion of Scripture and how applicable it is in our lives even today. Oh, how mindful I am of the help that these believers in Colossae must have received as they were reading and digesting the truth contained within this book of Colossians. I pray this morning that you would help us. Lord, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness, of judgment to come. Lord, I pray for each believer. Would you help us to walk with you? Help us, God, to grow, to be rooted and grounded in Christ, rooted and built up in Christ. I pray, Father, that you would help us to be prepared individually and corporately as a church to contend for the faith, understanding that the best defense for false teaching is spiritual growth, that we would, as Paul said of these believers in Colossae, he says, beholding your order, steadfastness of your faith in Christ, that we too would be like that organized army, setting a firm defense against the attack of the enemy and the false teaching that is so prevalent today. Help us, God. Work in lives, have your will and way, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar is open. I'm gonna come and pray down here at this altar. You want to pray in your seat? Would you let the Lord have his way in your life today? If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you, like, you know for sure that heaven is your home. Maybe you need to grow, maybe you'd be honest with the Lord about your walk, and you say, Lord I need, I need to grow. I need to walk with you. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.",
