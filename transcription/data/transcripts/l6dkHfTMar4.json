  "text": "this portion of scripture this morning. And we, of course, last week started a mini-series on preparation for revival. And in the message last Sunday morning, I sought to establish the need for revival. We looked at the book of Nehemiah in the first chapter, and we understood that Nehemiah requested a report, he received a report, and his response is really what we focused upon, and how he responded to the report that he'd received. And I sought to provide you last week with a report on the church in America. And as we began to look at a number of statistics last week, I believe that it was quite evident that we are in need of revival. I said this, and it's worth repeating, no longer should we shift the focus upon another group, another denomination, another whatever you want to label somebody as, in order to expose their sin or their failure. But rather, we must desire the light of God's Word to be focused upon us as individuals, and in our local church, and acknowledge the need for revival. We mention this, that revival, a very simple definition, is God bringing His people back to spiritual health. We understand that as we acknowledge the need for revival, that we could sit here this morning, and we could say, okay, we acknowledge, we understand, we agree with the truth that we need revival, now what? Thus, we've titled the message this morning, The Pathway to Revival. The Pathway to Revival. And I want you to understand at the very beginning of the message this morning that the pathway to revival, there are many hindrances to that pathway. We find that there are many things that will cause the people of God to even perhaps acknowledge the need, but never step foot on the pathway to revival. Maybe they consider the cost, and they say the cost is just too great. They're not really willing to change things. They're not really willing to pay what the cost is to truly have revival. The hindrances to revival are many. We find that the enemy does not desire for the people of God to be revived. He is perfectly content and satisfied with God's people being apathetic and indifferent. He is absolutely just perfectly fine with the church of God in America being comfortable. God never called us to comfort. In fact, He said, \"'Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus \"'shall suffer persecution.'\" We find that we look at the church of the Laodiceans referred to there in Revelation chapter number three, and they were a church that was, man, they were comfortable. They had everything that they needed, quote unquote. They were apathetic and they were indifferent. They had this perspective that they had need of nothing, and really even the Lord, because the Lord was on the outside of the church that He bought with His blood, knocking. This morning, as we think about the pathway to revival, we consider the hindrances that are there, and we understand that there'll be great difficulty, but I hope this morning that we've acknowledged the need and we've determined that I wanna get on the pathway to revival. Revival is for the individual. Let me say this, revival is a work of God. It is God bringing His people back to spiritual health. It is a work of God Almighty, and the psalmist said this in Psalm 85 in verse number six. He says, \"'Wilt thou,' speaking of the Lord, \"'wilt thou not revive us again?' It's a work of God. We cannot manufacture the work of God. We ought not ever seek to manufacture the work of God. We simply desire that God would work, and this morning, we understand that revival is a work of God. I would say this, we're in a place and a position in our lives and in our nation where we come to a place of being desperate to see God work. We're desperate to see God work. The psalmist said this in Psalm 119 in verse 126. He said, \"'It is time for thee, Lord, to work, \"'for they have made void thy law.'\" Think about that phrase. It is time for thee, Lord, to work. We are desperate to see God work. We are desirous to see God work, and as we think about this pathway to revival, as we seek to embark on this pathway, and we draw our attentions to what the prophet of God said in Hosea 10 in verse number 12, it's a familiar verse of Scripture, but I want you to notice in verse number 12 of Hosea 10, notice what the word of God says. \"'Sow to yourselves in righteousness, \"'reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground, \"'for it is time to seek the Lord, \"'till He come and reign righteousness upon you.'\" Of interest to me in this particular verse of Scripture is that little phrase in the middle of the verse where it says, \"'For it is time to seek the Lord.'\" We mentioned that the psalmist declared in Psalm 119 in verse number 126, \"'It is time for thee, Lord, to work,' but here the prophet of God is saying to the people of God that it's time for you to do some things. And yes, revival is the work of God, but we ought to be in a position where we are prepared for God to send revival. And as we look at this particular passage of Scripture, I'm gonna go a little bit out of order of how it's actually worded here in verse number 12, but I want you to notice as we think about this truth of the pathway to revival, I seek to get, I embark upon this journey, this path to revival, I must first of all, I would say this, it is time to plow, it's time to plow. Notice the verse of Scripture, it says this in the middle of the verse there, \"'Break up your fallow ground.'\" Break up your fallow ground. We understand the agricultural analogy that is being used here by the prophet of God, and we find that as he's using this agricultural analogy that he's seeking to establish spiritual truth, oftentimes in the Old Testament, you'll find that the people of God had hearts that were hardened, they had hearts that were not prepared for the word of God, they were resistant, they were stiff-necked, they were rebellious, and we find that their heart was not right with God. They would go through the motions many times, and they would bring their sacrifices, and they would say that we fasted, but God's saying, listen, I'm concerned about your heart. Your heart is far from Me. And we find that as we look here at this phrase of Scripture where the Bible says, break up your fallow ground, and we begin to think about the importance of our heart being ready to receive the truth of the word of God, being ready to receive the seed of God's word. We understand as we, again, speak of the agricultural analogy that is here in this verse of Scripture, we planted a garden this year. And there's never been a garden in the place where we've planted a garden, at least not for a long, long time, if there ever had been. And there was a lot of work to get that ground prepared. There was a lot of labor that had to go forth. There were, Joseph and I, he's smiling up here because he was the one that was there with me working, and I mean, it was labor, it was work. Why? Because I couldn't just go out there and throw down some seeds and expect that they would take root and they would produce some level of fruit for us. No, the ground had to be prepared. The ground had to be plowed up. There was work that needed to be done. By the way, I couldn't just start with plowing. I mean, there was a lot that had to be done in preparing that soil. And then once the preparations were completed, we could then plant the seeds, plant the plants, and then reap a harvest. But we understand this agricultural analogy, and we begin to think about our own hearts and desiring that we'd have hearts that are tender toward the things of God. Look over, if you will, in the book of 2 Chronicles in chapter 34. In 2 Chronicles chapter 34, God speaks to us about one of the kings of Judah, and really, Josiah here in this passage of Scripture, what a great man of God, what a great leader for the nation of Judah, the great revival that took place under his leadership. We find that it's in this portion of Scripture in 2 Chronicles 34 that God gives us some insight to the man Josiah. And of course, we know that he was just a boy when he began to reign. And he began to reign during a time in Judah's history of great wickedness and great depravity and idol worship. And we find that now, Josiah comes to the place and he gets busy and he begins to serve God. And by the way, we ought never overlook the youth in our church. I was praying this morning, I was sitting here on the platform, I got some sunburn, so I was sitting, not kneeling. And, but God's okay with that, amen? And I was sitting here praying early this morning, and I was praying for each one of you by name this morning and praying that God would work in our hearts and in our lives. And I began to pray for the young people as they sit. near the front and I began to pray that God would use them and maybe they would be the catalyst that God would use to bring some revival. It was just a little lad that gave his lunch to the Lord Jesus Christ. And sometimes if we're not careful, we can despise little things, we can despise young, but we find here that while he was young, he began to, as he had a heart for God, he began to do the work of God. And the Bible tells us in verse number 14 of 2 Chronicles 34 that he had given the instruction with regard to the work and to repair the house of the Lord and it says that when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses. And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan and Shaphan carried the book to the king. This is Josiah and it brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants, they do it. And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the hand of the workmen. Then Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And notice the Bible tells us in verse number 18 that Shaphan read it, the book that was found in the house of the Lord before the king. We know the book, the Bible tells us in verse number 14 that the book that was found was of the law of the Lord given by Moses. And we find that he's using the word of God. He's beginning to read the word of God to the king. Now the king has already been doing some great things, has he not? I mean, he's already given some instruction with regard to repairing the house of the Lord and so on and so forth. In fact, in the very carrying out of those instructions is where they find the word of God. Shaphan begins to read the word of God. I'm thankful this morning that God's word is powerful. No doubt this man had a heart that was prepared to receive. We see in verse number 19 it says, and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes. You say, well, that's not very kingly. God's word impacted him. The Bible says that the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahiakim, the son of Shaphan and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe and Esaias, servant of the king, saying, go inquire the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found. For great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord to do after all that is written in this book. You find that not only did he hear the word of God, but he responded to the word of God. He responded in humility and in brokenness, and he begins to give instruction with regard to inquiring of the Lord to determine what it was that would transpire because of the rebellion, because of the sin of the people. And I want you to skip down, if you will, in verse number 26, and it says, and ask for the king of Judah, speaking here again about Josiah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord. So shall you say unto him, thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard. Then notice verse 27, because thine heart was tender, because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humblest thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me, I have even heard thee also, saith the Lord. He says, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to the grave in peace. That's a huge blessing for Josiah. He says, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place. He was spared from that. Isn't that amazing? And upon the inhabitants of the same, so they brought the king word again. And so you notice that because of his response, it says, because in verse 27, thine heart was tender. And that was the key, having that tender heart, it then led to his humility before the Lord when he heard the words of God. And the Bible tells us that he did rend his clothes, but he also wept before the Lord according to verse number 27. And we find how he responded with that heart that was tender. Begin to think about our heart and breaking up that fallow ground again. This time to plow in order that we would have our hearts prepared to receive the seed of God's word. You know, on a daily basis, we need to ensure that our hearts are prepared to receive the truth of God's word. We come to the house of God, we've been praying before each of our services and really focusing in that prayer time, that corporate prayer time at the start of our services that God would move and work in the midst of our service. It's not a time to pray for the folks that are sick or the folks that are traveling, but God in this hour, would you move? Would you work? Would you help my heart to be ready to receive that I might respond to the word of God? That we enter into the house of God with a level of anticipation and expectation that God has a message for me, that God has truth for me. By the way, we should enter our time of prayer in Bible study every day with that same perspective. That we open our Bibles in the mornings or whenever it is that you might read your Bible and you open the word of God and you say, God, would you speak to my heart? Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. Lord, open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. Teach me, Lord. Help me to respond, Lord, that I might be a doer of the word and not a hearer only. That our hearts would be ready. Our hearts would be prepared. We find that the psalmist speaks of this. It's interesting, Psalm 51 is the great psalm of repentance of David. Of course, after his sin there with Bathsheba and Uriah. And it's interesting because a couple of times here in this portion of scripture, he speaks about a clean heart and being clean. And notice with me in Psalm 51 in verse number 10. Notice as David is praying, and if you were to read the entirety of the psalm, you see his acknowledgement of his sin and his confession of his sin in the beginning of this chapter. And we come to verse number 10 and he says, create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. He had said this in verse number seven, purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. He now mentions specifically creating me a clean heart. There's something about this phraseology when David is praying and he's saying, I want a clean heart. I don't want a dirty heart. I don't want a hard heart. I want a clean heart. I heard David Gibbs make this statement that too often the people of God are content with being cleaner, but not being clean. The reality is that if you gave me a dirty glass, and so that's dirty, I need a clean one, and you just kind of wish it around with some water and then put it back and say, well, there you go. It's cleaner than it was. It might be true, right? It may be cleaner than it was, but I'm still not interested in drinking my water or my sweet tea from that particular glass. I'd prefer that my glass is clean. You ever go to a restaurant and you got a fork that's dirty? Some people just take that fork that's dirty and they just take out the napkin and they just kind of, no, man, I want a clean one, amen? I don't want it to just be a little cleaner. I don't want just the hard stuff plucked off, you know what I'm saying? You ever been in a restaurant and you had that happen? Come on, man, I want it clean. Joseph wants to bring his own, amen, right? He wants to just bring his own silverware. He's not interested in eating off something that somebody else ate off of. And listen, create in me a clean heart. Not just cleaner, but clean. Think about that. The heart, plow, it's time to plow. Break up your fallow ground. Notice what he says in verse 17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God, thou wilt not despise. Notice how he describes it in verse 17 as a broken and contrite heart. David, in this particular psalm, he's broken over his sin. By the way, it should not just be the consequences of our sin that should cause us to be broken. It should be the fact that we've offended a holy God. Against Thee and Thee only have I done this wickedness. Have I sinned? I've done this evil in Thy sight. And sometimes if we're not careful, we can be broken over the consequences of our sin, but not really broken over the fact that we've offended a holy God. This morning, we find that the instruction of Hosea to these that he's writing to contains with it this admonition to break up your fallow ground. It's just time to plow. If we're gonna get on this pathway to revival. We've acknowledged the need for revival. So, okay, we acknowledge, we agree, we wanna get on the path, we wanna embark on this journey. Starts with the heart. Plow up. Break up your fallow ground. Notice number two, it's time to plant. It's time to plant. You know, it really doesn't do a whole lot of good to plow up agriculturally, if we're speaking of the agricultural analogy that's being used here in this passage of Scripture in Hosea 10. It doesn't do a whole lot of good to plow and break up the fallow ground and then leave it, right? Some of you know, with our garden this year, I started a little bit early, earlier than I was supposed to, and I was trying to get that thing ready, and then I broke my finger, and then I couldn't do anything. I couldn't grab the shovel, I couldn't grab the rake, I couldn't grab the rototiller, I couldn't do anything. And so guess what started to happen in that place that we had put apart to prepare for a garden? Some things started growing in it, and they weren't things that I planted in it, right? Those things were weeds. Isn't it amazing how quickly those things can grow? And all of that work that then had to cease, you started to see all of this stuff creep in. And see, when we break up our fallow ground, when we plow, then it's time to plant, it's time to get the seed, the seed of God's Word. We see that the Bible says here in Hosea 10, in verse number 12, sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy. We understand that sowing and reaping is a law of nature. We understand that God has given throughout His Word this truth of sowing and reaping, and we see it in nature, we see it in our own lives, and we find here that it's necessary, it's important, it's imperative that we are sowing good seed. He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness. And then what are you gonna reap? He says, reap in mercy. It's a great contrast that we see in verse number 13. It says, ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity. What a contrast in verse 13 from verse number 12, as the instruction is being provided to the people of God with regard to the procedure that they're to follow, not only of breaking up that fallow ground, but it's time to plant, it's time to sow that good seed. Notice in the book of Galatians, again, we're familiar with this text of Scripture. There's great truth here with regard to this principle of sowing and reaping in Galatians chapter six, verses seven and eight. And we look at what is given to us here in this New Testament epistle. We find that Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, begins by saying, be not deceived. You will find that type of terminology on occasion throughout the Word of God. You'll find throughout the Word of God at times where you'll see beware. And I find in my own life, personally, as I come to a verse of Scripture that says, be not deceived, my antenna, so to speak, kinda is a little bit more in tune with what's going on. Why? Because the reality is that if God prefaces what He's going to say with be not deceived, the reality is that many must be deceived with this thinking. And so he says, be not deceived. God is not mocked. What sober man soweth, that shall he also reap. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. It's a law that God has established. He gives further insight to this truth in verse number eight. He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. Now, I hope that we're not interested in that first part of verse number eight. I don't wanna reap corruption. Do you? No, thank you. Well, so he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. Now, we like that word shall when it's in Romans 10, 13. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. And then we say something like this, it doesn't mean that you might be saved, doesn't mean that you could be saved. Man, it is certain, it is absolute, you shall be saved. And then all of a sudden we read the same word somewhere else and we say, well. God says he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. That's negative, but look at the positive at the end of verse number eight. But he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. He then says, let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. You know, it's possible to become weary, begin to see things that are taking place in our world and begin to think that maybe our efforts aren't really worth it. The reality is that right now we're at a place where we're hollies out there picking tomatoes almost every day. But you know, that didn't happen overnight. There's a truth of sowing and reaping that it's not immediate. And he says in verse number nine, let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not, that we persevere, that we continue on. And we think about this truth of this sowing to yourselves in righteousness and it's time to plant. It was J. Vernon McGee that made this statement. He said, unfortunately, in his experience that too many of God's people would spend six days a week sowing seeds of wickedness and then they'd show up to church on Sunday and they would pray for crop failure. You just let that sink in just for a moment. He said for six days they would sow seeds of wickedness. Then they'd show up to church and they'd pray for crop failure. But God says be not deceived. God is not mocked. Whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap. And we find this morning that as we begin to think about this process, this pathway to revival, it starts with preparing my heart, breaking up our fallow ground, having a heart that is tender and ready to receive that as we open the word of God. By the way, let me say this. We don't need to wait until September 18th to have revival. Revival is not something that's just on a calendar. We have a revival meeting that's on the calendar on September the 18th or the 21st and we have a special guest speaker that's coming. But the reality is that you, we can have revival. I can have revival today. We can have that revival in our lives where God has brought his people, he's brought us as individuals back to that place of spiritual health. We begin to plant those good seeds. Begin to plant so to the spirit, as he says in Galatians 6 and verse number eight, so shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. You say, well, I'm just not seeing any of the results. Takes time. You don't plant today and reap tomorrow. Now, sometimes the fruit comes faster than other times. In fact, if you're to plant some fruit trees, they take a whole lot longer to produce fruit than some vegetables, vegetable plants that you can plant, right? And we see those laws in nature. And so we find here that it's time to plow back to Hosea 10, it's time to plant. Let me say this, it's time to pursue. It says this in verse number 12, for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you. I want you to notice that phrase when he says, it is time to seek the Lord, the idea of pursuing the Lord. I would say this, that there are many things in our world today, many things in your life today, many things in my life today that are competing for our attention, competing for our pursuit, right? A lot of things. But we must be laser focused on pursuing our God. I mean, laser focused. There are a lot of distractions, a lot of things that are gonna come and try to gain our attention to pursue this and pursue that and pursue this thing over here. And oftentimes when we're pursuing those things, we find that those things are just temporal things. They're things that just fade away. And it could be our lifelong pursuit. And we find out that it doesn't bring the joy or happiness that we thought it would bring. How many people have had that testimony? In fact, Holly was asking me last night, there was a, we were talking a little bit about college football and she asked me this question. She said, well, how many of these college players actually make it to the NFL? And I said, it's probably about 1% or less. She said, are you kidding me? She said it was a lot higher than that. But I mean, if you do the math, you just figure it out. It's one or less percent. I didn't do a Google search. Google knows everything. But I just kind of did the math in my head and tried to figure it out. But you. Just work how they are. She said, so why are they doing this? That's what she asked me. She doesn't understand sports a whole lot, right? And doesn't like sports a whole lot. But that was her question. And the reality is that we could ask ourselves the question of ourselves. Why am I pursuing what I'm pursuing? Why am I doing what I'm doing? And we think about this truth this morning of seeking the Lord, of pursuing Him, and understand there are all sorts of things that will vie for our attention, that are competing for our pursuit, that I must be laser focused on pursuing the Lord. And let me say this this morning, we are not pursuing the blessings. We're pursuing God. There's a great difference. So often what happens if we're not careful is we begin to lead and live our lives in such a way that maybe we're just seeking the blessing, maybe we're just seeking the blessing from God instead of seeking God. I'm thankful for God's blessing, but you understand this morning that God is worthy of our pursuit without regard of the blessing. He is worthy. Let me say it this way, He's worthy of our service without the blessing of our service. Amen? And if we're not careful, there are times in which we think maybe that we could manipulate the hand of God, that if I do these certain things, if I do this certain thing, that it means it's going to result in this way. And the reality is that God is sovereign and God has a plan and God has a purpose. And it doesn't, we cannot manipulate God, but we must still live in such a way that we're pleasing God. Does that make sense this morning? Because when I want to please God, listen, this morning, God is good. Was God good in the life of Job? Sure he was. But did Job lose everything? Yeah. Yeah. But God was still good. Was God good in the life of, we can begin to enlist all sorts of people. How about Paul and Silas? They're on a missionary journey. Bringing the gospel to Philippi. Right? They're serving God. They're doing what God's called them to do. And then they get beaten. They get imprisoned. You say, yeah, but the, the Lord sent an earthquake and delivered them. I understand. But they still got beaten and imprisoned. That's more than I've gotten. How about Isaiah? If you read the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter, the hall of faith chapter that we often refer to it as, we see great triumphs in Hebrews chapter number 11. And we can look at Hebrews 11 and we can read of those triumphs and we can read of, by faith, this particular hero of the faith did this and this one did this and this one did this. But we come to the end of Hebrews chapter 11 and we read what the Bible says and others, in verse 36, had trial of cool mockings and scourgings. Yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. I mean, it's exciting to read about Daniel in the den of lions. Exciting to read about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace. But you read of these others, the Bible says in verse 37, they were stoned. They were stoned. Think about Stephen in Acts chapter number seven. Was Stephen not doing what he was supposed to do? No, man, he was preaching. And he was preaching a powerful message. The people were under conviction. They lashed out at him, they stoned him. Others that were stoned, notice this, they were sawn asunder. History would tell us that Isaiah faced such a death. The prophet Isaiah saw God high, holy, and lifted up, preached faithfully. Listen, we're not pursuing the blessing. We're pursuing God. And as we pursue God, it is within his sovereign right on what he allows to happen in our lives and how he will use those circumstances in our lives for the purpose of bringing glory and honor to himself. John 11 in our Sunday school lesson this morning. And the reality is that as we seek God, that we understand that we're seeking and serving him. He is worthy, he is God Almighty. Can you imagine that the God of the universe would even allow us to seek or to serve him? If we seek him with all of our heart, he should be found in us. You think about that, that we can have that communion with God Almighty as we seek him, as we seek him. Notice what the psalmist says, turn to Psalm chapter 42, if you will. Look at the analogy that the psalmist uses here, and this is a great truth, and I hope that, one, that we could look at our own lives and we could say, yes, it's in this manner that I want to seek the Lord and to pursue my God. And we find that in Psalm 42, is this not on? Jim's back there telling me this is not on. Somebody's gonna put some bad batteries in my thing up here. Dean, is that you? Dean's not even in here, amen. I'm gonna change the batteries real quick. Stand by, commercial break. Jim? No, no good? Pulpit mic. Just use the pulpit mic, amen. All right, we'll get rid of this thing, and let me just use the pulpit mic. That means I can't move. All right, Psalm 42, look at verses one and two. The Bible says this. As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? Notice the imagery of verse number one of Psalm 42. As the heart panteth after the water brooks. You think about the imagery that is used here in an animal that has not had the quenching of its thirst, an animal that's running and desiring, and it says, as the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. Have you ever been thirsty? Have you ever been hungry? You know, in America, we say we're hungry. We just ate like a few hours ago. You know what I'm saying? Your kids sometimes will say, I'm starving. Your husband sometimes will say, all the ladies, I'm starving, what's for dinner, right? And we, listen, the reality is that we've not really known hunger, most of us, right? Like some in the world have known hunger. You ever been in a position where you're just, you feel like you're parched, you just need a drink. You just need something to quench your thirst. The psalmist says, in that manner, that's how I am pursuing God. So panteth my soul after thee, O God. When's the last time, I just need God's word. It doesn't matter what else is going on. I just need God's word. Because when we need that drink, when we need that sustenance, there's something that comes in to distract us and we say, hold on, I need to do this first. I need a drink. I just wonder of our pursuit of God. How are we longing for God? When we get up on Sunday morning and we get to go to church today, we get to fellowship with the believers today, we get to worship God today, we get to hear from the word of God, God has a message for me. Man, I can't wait to get there. Because I'm longing for God. My devotions daily, what is it that would distract us from seeking God and saying, I'm pursuing God. I just want to get into his word. I just want God to show me and reveal himself to me and help me. And I'm longing for that. We find that here as we begin to think about this seeking the Lord, this pursuit of God, again, being laser focused and understanding how desperately we need him. A missionary from Asia came to the United States several years ago and said, I don't know the missionary. I don't know the pastor that gave the story. But I read that after being in the United States for a few weeks, the pastor that had kind of took him around and introduced him to some friends and tried to raise some support in different things, the pastor inquired what he thought about the American church. And this man from the other side of the world said, I'm amazed at how much you can accomplish without God. And that stunned the pastor. He said, all of your programs, all of your, and he just began to listen. He said, I'm not trying to criticize. I'm just giving an answer to the question that you asked. I'm amazed at how much you can do without God. But the reality is that if we understand biblically without him, we can do nothing. And what needs to happen in our lives when we think about this pursuit of God is we must come to a place where we recognize how desperately we need God. And with that same level of desperateness of seeking that drink to quench a thirst or that sustenance to quench a hunger pain, that we say spiritually, I have that level of desperation to seek God, to minister to my spirit and to my soul. I need God. And I'm seeking God. I'm not just seeking a blessing from God, I'm seeking God. Paul said this in Colossians 3, if you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth. For you're dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. The kingdom of God is not going to advance by our church becoming filled with men. But can I tell you for a long time, that's really been our goal. Our goal in our churches for a number of generations has been we've got to fill the church house, fill the church house, fill the church house. And I'm not saying that that's a bad goal, reaching people with the gospel. In fact, he told us in John 15 in the same passage where he said that without him we can do nothing, he said, herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit. So we understand that God is glorified as we bear fruit. But the reality is that the kingdom of God is not going to advance just by our churches being filled with men, but by the individuals in our churches becoming filled with God. And as we as individuals in our churches are filled with God, the result of that is that we'll be reaching people with the gospel. The result of that is that the church house will be filled up. But that's not the number one goal. The number one goal is that I'm filled with God. Be filled with the spirit. We spoke of that last Sunday evening and the importance of that truth. There's a great contrast in Hosea 10 as we wrap up this morning. In Hosea 10 verses 12 and 13, there's a great contrast between those two verses of scripture. And we find that the contrast is provided to us and we find that really in verse number 12, the prophet of God is telling them that they need a different path than the one in which they've journeyed on. The path in which they've been on is given to us in verse number 13 and he says, no, you need a different path. And as we would begin to consider and really conclude this message this morning on this preparation for revival miniseries, this pathway to revival, we must look at the contrast here. He says, sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you. Notice what they have been doing. Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust. Notice these words, in thy way, thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty men. Solomon said, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in Proverbs 3, that we're to lean not on understanding, right, we're to trust in the Lord with all of our hearts. And here the word of God tells us that they were trusting in their own way. They had plowed wickedness, they had reaped iniquity, they've eaten the fruit of their lies, they had had a trust, a confidence in the multitude of their mighty men. And we find that here the prophet of God, Hosea, is saying, look, you need to change your course, you need to get on a different path. If you desire that God would come and rain righteousness upon you, then you need to change your course, you need to change your path. As we consider this morning the pathway to revival, we recognize, acknowledge the need for revival. If you weren't here last Sunday, you listened to the message, I believe that it was quite obvious that there's a need for revival. And again, it's not just that we point at another denomination, another group of people and say, look at them, look at all their, no, no, the light of God's word shines on us. Say, God, I need revival, God, we need revival. When we acknowledge that need, what's the pathway to revival? Three thoughts this morning, it's time to plow. It's time for God to work. I agree with the psalmist in Psalm 119, 126, but the prophet says, well, there's some things that you need to do. Number one, you need to plow, break up your fallow ground, plant, sow to yourselves in righteousness. And then we need to pursue, seeking God, not just for a blessing, but seeking God because he's worthy of our pursuit, because he's a good God, he's a great God. We're pursuing him. Next week, we'll have our third message on this thought of the preparation for revival and ask ourselves this question, am I revival ready? It'll be wonderful. Come to church next week already having revival. I preach a message, are you revival ready? Man, we're not revival ready, we're having revival, amen? Because revival is when God brings his people back to spiritual health. This morning, I don't want to just be cleaner, I want to be clean. Preparation for revival, the pathway to revival, there are hindrances, there are hindrances, many hindrances. But I hope that we'd clear the hindrances out and say, I'm going to get on that path. Let's pray together. God, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We thank you, God, for the opportunity that you've given us to gather together. We thank you for your word, for the truth of your word. God, we pray that you would, in these few moments, these quiet moments, Lord, of invitation, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would move in hearts and lives. You'd take your word and minister as only you can. I pray that we take the time to respond, that we would not leave here just by checking a box and filling a requirement, quote unquote, but God, that we truly let you have your way. We'd get on this pathway to revival, help us to have hearts that are tender, ready to receive the seed of your word. Help us, Lord. We need you. Pray that you'd work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano, and as she plays, the altar is open. Come and ask the Lord to just respond to God, however he's spoken to you this morning. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.",
