  "text": "A little over three months, actually, since we've been in the book of Colossians, and I know that many of you take notes and have your notebooks, and if you want to mark down, this is message number 10 through the book of Colossians, but message number 9 was on March 14th. And so I don't know if you want to put a little notation maybe in your notes so that you can be able to go back and see the continuation, if you will. But as we look at Colossians 2 this morning, we'll be looking at verses 11 through 15. And notice what the Word of God says here, beginning in verse number 11 of Colossians 2. In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. Verse 13. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Notice the last phrase of verse number 14. We'll use it for our title this morning. Nailing it to his cross. We of course sang that wonderful, familiar hymn this morning. It is well with my soul, and that third verse speaks about my sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought. My sin, not in part, but the whole, is nailed to his cross, and I bear it no more. Isn't that wonderful? And here we find that Paul is writing to these believers in Colossae, of course, if we could take, since it's been so long since we've looked at Colossians, the book, and chapter 2 in particular. We'll be reminded this morning by way of introduction that Colossians 2 begins with Paul expressing his concern for the brethren. In fact, he voices it this way. He says in verse number 1 that he has this conflict. He says, I have a great conflict for you. And we understand as we begin to study Colossians chapter number 2 and read about this conflict, this concern that Paul had for these believers, not only here at Colossae, but also those in the city of Laodicea, we understand that he was concerned for them because the enemy was active. The enemy was working and the enemy was active, and Paul has this concern for the brethren, and that concern leads him to the next several verses by which we took two messages to study through, verses really 4 through 10, and we dealt with the subject matter of the warning. Remember that the apostle Paul, as he highlighted and explained to the believers in Colossae what his ministry was, he said that he was ministering and he was seeking to teach every man, but that his ministry also included warning every man. And as we look at Colossians chapter number 2, we see that Paul is issuing these warnings, and Paul is seeking to help the believers understand how it is that the enemy works and how it is that we as the people of God are to combat the enemy. We find that the warning was issued, and of course it was their responsibility to take heed to that which had been given. We find that Paul would explain several things in our text that we're going to look at this morning in verses 11 through 15 as to that which was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary. I'm so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cross, amen? I'm so thankful that he took my place. The plan of redemption was determined before the foundation of the world, and the price of redemption was determined to be the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh. And we understand that he came and he fulfilled. He said when he hung upon that cross before he gave up the ghost, it is finished. And I'm so thankful that as Paul would begin to share with these believers in Colossae some of that which was accomplished at Calvary, it's right after he tells them in verse number 10, and we've used it for our theme this year, ye are complete in him, complete in Christ. And some of that false teaching that was taking place there in Colossae that was prevalent at this particular time would cause people to think that they needed something in addition to Christ. Yes, there are those that would give false teaching and they would say, well, Christ plus your works, and so on and so forth. But we find that these particular false teachers, they would speak about some level of maybe mysticism and what have you, and the going deeper, if you will, and the way in which some of these believers would have been influenced by this false teaching. And Paul helps them understand, you're complete in Christ, you're complete in Christ. Let me share with you what was accomplished at Calvary. If you're taking notes this morning, notice number one with me. Consider what Christ did for sinners. Consider what Christ did for sinners. In verses 11 through 14, the Apostle Paul will share with these believers in Colossae what was accomplished on the cross of Calvary for sinners. By the way, all men are sinners, amen? And as we begin to look at this text of Scripture, we understand that Paul is writing to the believers in Colossae, and as he's writing to these individuals, he reminds them of what they were, but then he reminds them of what they are because of what Christ accomplished at Calvary for sinners. And as we begin to understand and unfold some of these things, again, as I mentioned a moment ago, all men are sinners. Yes, it's written to these believers in Colossae, but we understand that the truth that is contained herein is truth that is applicable to every man, every human being that's ever walked upon the face of the earth. We understand, even as we would look at nature, why does an apple tree produce apples? Because it's an apple tree, right? Pretty simple truth, pretty simple understanding, and that apple tree does not produce peaches because it's an apple tree. And why is it that human beings sin? It's because we're sinners. And we're sinners, and therefore we sin, and there's this huge problem. It's a condition that affects all mankind of sin. We find that here sin would be dealt with at Calvary, and Paul is reminding them of some of these things that were accomplished. First we understand what we were. Notice what he says here in verse number 13, and you being dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh. Notice in verse number 14, blotting out the handwriting, but notice what it says here, of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us. If we could simply just highlight a couple of things with regard to the condition of mankind, we'd understand that man is condemned already. We understand that we're dead in our sins and in our transgressions. We understand that we have this handwriting of ordinances that was against us, it was contrary to us, and we find that as we would look at this truth of being condemned and being dead in our sins, we find that we would simply be able to say this, we are guilty before a holy God. We're guilty. I think about the nation of Israel, and you think about the truth of the Ten Commandments, and it's interesting in Exodus 19 when Moses is confronting the children of Israel before God would call him up to the mount in chapter number 20, but we find that God and Moses had some interaction in chapter 19, and Moses has then some interaction with the people of God, and the people say in Exodus 19, all that the Lord would command, we will do. We find that it's in Exodus chapter number 20 that God gives those Ten Commandments. We know that the law in its entirety is much broader than simply Ten Commandments, but we find that they had said, whatever the Lord commands, we will do. Now how did they do with that? Not so well. Why? Because the law reveals the condition of mankind. The law shows us that we're sinners. The law shows us that we're condemned. In fact, James says it this way in James 2, in verse number 10, when we think about this truth with regard to the law, the Bible says, for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. We find that the Word of God would teach us about our condition, and here Paul is reminding these believers of their condition. When the Gospel first came to them, how it was that God in His grace and His mercy brought the truth to them because they were condemned already. Remember what God says, the Lord Jesus Christ says this in John 3, after an interaction with Nicodemus, we find in John 3, in verse number 16, a very familiar verse of Scripture to us. The Bible says, for God so loved the world. Aren't you thankful for the love of God? For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Notice verse 17, for God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\" We are condemned already. We're at enmity with God. Romans 5 and verse 8 says that God commendeth His love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. We find that 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, as Paul is there sharing with the believers in Corinth and expressing to them all that Christ did for us and the plan of redemption and the imputed righteousness upon the child of God. He says, \"...for He,\" speaking of God, \"...hath made Him,\" speaking of Jesus, \"...hath made Him to be sin for us,\" notice, \"...who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.\" Peter says it this way. If you take and turn to 1 Peter 4, notice what Peter says here with regard to the work at Calvary and to the work that was accomplished. 1 Peter 3 I want you to notice verse 18. 1 Peter 3 and verse 18, \"...for Christ also hath once suffered for sins.\" Notice this, \"...the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.\" And so we find that Paul, as he begins to speak to these believers in Colossae, and after he'd given them warning and dealing with some of the false teaching that's taking place there, he's going to remind them what they are in Christ. And before he begins to express to them what they are, he reminds them of what they were. That they were dead in their sins and their trespasses, as he says to the believers in Ephesus. That they had this handwriting of ordinances that was against us, that was contrary to us. Listen, we were guilty. There's no way that we could ever stand and say, nope, I fulfilled all of it. We're guilty. We're guilty. As we begin to think about what we were, we can rejoice greatly in what we now are. And notice with me in this same passage here in Colossians 2, in verse 13, we've only read portions of these two verses in our first aspect of this point, but notice the Bible says, \"...and you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,\" notice this, \"...hath He quickened together with Him.\" That word quickened means to make alive. And we understand the truth of the rebirth. You must be born again. And I'm so thankful for the truth of the supernatural, the spiritual birth, and the truth of being born again, being redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. And we find here that He says that you, \"...hath He quickened together with Him.\" Then notice the final phrase of verse 13, \"...having forgiven you...\" What's that next word say? Aren't you thankful for every word of God? \"...having forgiven you all trespasses.\" Isn't it good to be forgiven? I mean, honestly. He didn't say He forgave you most. He didn't say He forgave you some. He said, \"...forgiving you all trespasses.\" Notice how He begins verse 14, \"...blotting out...\" Now notice it says, \"...the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us, and we understand that that handwriting of ordinance was against us, that we are guilty...\" Remember when they found the lady, they said we've caught her in the very act in this immorality, and they were going there to accuse her that they might stone her. And what did Jesus do? He wrote in the sand. I don't know what He wrote. I can only imagine what He wrote were some of the sins that those very people were guilty of. And He says what? The one that has no sin casts the first stone. Amen? I'm thankful that He's blotted out. Listen, we're guilty. The handwriting of ordinances that was against us, that was contrary to us, but He's blotted it out. And you think about the way that He did that we sang this morning. Are you washed in the blood? In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb. It's through the blood of Jesus Christ, His death, burial, and resurrection, that that handwriting of ordinances that was against us, that was contrary to us, it's only through His blood that it can be blotted out. And hallelujah for that. We find that He says blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us and really carrying with it that idea of what I mentioned in the beginning of the message this morning, how that Jesus said it is finished. It is finished. If you've ever had a mortgage, if you've ever had any kind of a loan, and it finally comes to the end of the final payment, and there's something that you get, this promissory note when you receive the loan, and then that promissory note when it's paid in full, they issue paid in full. It's complete. It's done with. And here we find that this handwriting of ordinances that was against us, that was contrary to us, that it was blotted out. Notice what He says at the end of the verse. He took it out of the way. Nailing it to His cross. Aren't you thankful for that? We begin to think about what we were. That we were dead in our sins and our trespasses. That we were condemned. That we were guilty. But when you think about what we are, thinking that we've been made alive, we've been quickened together with Him. We have been forgiven of all of our trespasses. That they've been blotted out. That He's taken it out of the way. Nailing it to His cross that now we can stand and understand that we've been redeemed. That we've been reconciled to God Almighty. That we have been imputed with the very righteousness of God Almighty. The Bible tells us this in the book of Romans in chapter 5 and verse 1. I'll give you a moment to turn there. We'll look at a couple of verses here in the book of Romans. But notice Romans 5. We referenced a moment ago verse 8. But I want you to look at verse 1 in Romans 5. The Bible says this in Romans 5 and verse 1, Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. The only way to be justified is by faith and we understand that the only way to have peace with God is through the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm thankful for reconciliation that when we were guilty and condemned and we were distant and separated from God Almighty, that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, reconciled us. That we can enter into His very presence. Notice chapter 8. Notice what the Word of God says here in Romans 8 and verse 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Isn't it wonderful to be in Christ? To have understanding of what Christ did for us at Calvary. What He did for sinners. The reality is that if we remove the truth and the record of Calvary, we're hopeless and helpless. We are condemned. But I'm thankful that Jesus did come and that He did fulfill. Remember, the book of Galatians tells us that at the appointed time, that when the fullness of time was come, that God sent forth His Son. And the Bible gives us very clear indication as to why God sent forth His Son. He sent forth His Son, being made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law. Why? Because we're guilty. We're condemned already. I'm thankful for what the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished at the cross of Calvary. Notice back in Colossians 2, not only do we see as we consider what Christ did for sinners here at Calvary, not only do we notice the phrases that are given to us in verses 13 and 14, but we're mindful of that which is given to us in verses 11 and 12. Notice what He says in verse 11, in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. All of a sudden now in verse 11, this subject matter of circumcision comes up, but Paul begins to deal with circumcision from a different perspective. Jewish people, of course, would have had a very clear understanding of circumcision as soon as they hear the word being circumcised, they immediately begin thinking of the token of the Abrahamic covenant, the circumcision of flesh, but we find that it was not the Abrahamic covenant that was being dealt with, it was the new covenant, and it was the circumcision of the heart. And Paul is dealing here with that truth of what Christ did, and you think about conversion, and he says here that you're circumcised, notice this, with the circumcision made without hands. He's not talking about the token of the Abrahamic covenant. That's not in his view, in his focus, he's speaking about something entirely different, something for the child of God, the one that has been born again. Again, he says that you're circumcised with this circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. Isn't that wonderful? This new covenant that has been introduced, of course, the children of Israel in the book of Jeremiah in particular, they would have knowledge of the new covenant. You read the book of Hebrews as we studied last year and you see references to the new covenant. You find here that Paul is helping these individuals. Now, you remember that there were all sorts of these false teachings with regard to circumcision. In fact, it was in Galatians that they said unless you're circumcised, you can't be saved. And really, we find that that was dealt with if you go back to the book of Acts and you read and you understand the, really the council that took place there in Jerusalem. It's recorded for us, you don't need to turn there, but it's recorded for us in Acts chapter number 15. And there were some people that were saying this, except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, notice they said, ye cannot be saved. And Paul says, no, no, no, that's not true. That's not true. And they have this whole meeting and they determine, yes, it's not true, it's not biblically accurate. And so we find that they now here in Colossae, it wasn't so much that they would be saying that you had to be circumcised in order to be saved, but having circumcision somehow elevates your position, right, it elevates your standing with God. But Paul says, no, no, no, you're complete in Him. You're complete in Him and you have received this circumcision that's entirely different to that which they would deal with in the Old Testament to that which was the token of the Abrahamic covenant because you've been circumcised with that circumcision that is made without hands, the circumcision of the heart. By the way, throughout the Old Testament, was it not clearly given to the children of Israel that God was concerned about their heart? You're doing all of these outward things. You followed the token, the right of circumcision, if you will, and you've done these things and you've followed these feasts, but your heart is far from me, right? There you see it all throughout the Old Testament, God's concern for the heart. In verse number 12, he deals with the subject matter of baptism. He says, buried with Him in baptism, wherein also you're risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised Him from the dead. Begin to think about the truth of baptism. We find not only would the mode of baptism be clearly revealed here as being that of immersion, for the Bible says that you're buried with Him in baptism and then risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God. And we understand that baptism is an outward expression of an inward experience. We understand this morning that baptism cannot save you the same way that circumcision cannot save you. And there are some, unfortunately, that have misunderstood and misapplied and they believe and they teach and practice this thing of infant baptism and thinking that somehow, just like the children of Israel, on eight days they would circumcise their boys, that if you were baptized as an infant that somehow you have this entrance into this covenant with God and it's foreign to the Bible. You can't find it anywhere within the pages of Scripture of infant baptism. In fact, every person that you read of being baptized in the Word of God is somebody that is an adult that's made a decision, someone that is able to acknowledge that they have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and therefore they follow the Lord in believer's baptism. We find that there are those that have confused some of these things, but Paul is helping these believers to understand, again, what it was that Christ did for sinners at Calvary. What was it that was accomplished at Calvary? Why is it that there are so many songs that we as the people of God sing about Calvary? There are so many songs that contain within, maybe if the title specifically doesn't deal with the cross or with Calvary, but the words within the songs are reminding us of what Christ did at Calvary and the impact that it makes for us as children of God. I can only be a child of God because of Calvary. Amen? As we look at this portion of Scripture, we can rejoice greatly in our standing with Christ. Yes, we can be reminded of what we were, but how we ought to rejoice in what we now are in Christ. Number two this morning, if you're taking notes, I want you to consider not only what Christ did for sinners, but I want you to notice number two and consider with me what Christ did to Satan. In verse number 15, there's a clear indication of how it is that Christ triumphed over Satan. Now understand with me this morning that the readers of this particular book, when it was initially given, they would have been familiar with what they would be able to refer to as a Roman triumph. They would be very familiar with how the Romans would go into battle and as they would be victorious and as they would triumph over someone, they would be understanding of how they would come back with a parade and all of the hoopla that would go with it and how they would triumph over their enemies, how that they would bring some enemies back with them that would be shackled, that would be behind the chariots, if you will, that would be publicly shamed and it would be a triumph for the Romans and the particular general, if you want to use that terminology, that was able to be successful in battle. They would have been familiar with that process. They would have had an awareness of that particular situation and we find that I believe that Paul would use that familiar event to explain and illustrate to these believers at Colossae and for us this morning what it was that Christ did to Satan at Calvary. The Bible says this in verse number 15, and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. We understand as we look at this verse of Scripture, the reference to principalities and powers and we're mindful of that phraseology that Paul will use just a few pages back in the book of Ephesians when he's speaking to the church there at Ephesus with regard to the spiritual battle in which they're engaged in and he tells them in Ephesians 6 in verse number 10, finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. And then he says this in verse number 12, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, notice, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. And we find that he's speaking about the wiles of the devil in verse number 11 and then he deals with in verse number 12 that hierarchical structure, if you will, of those fallen demons led by none other than Lucifer himself and he says that they are principalities, powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world. We're fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places. And in chapter number two of Colossians in verse number 15, he says having spoiled principalities and powers. That word spoiled carries with it the idea of disarming or neutralizing an enemy. Again, keep in mind that picture of the Roman triumph and as the Roman soldiers would come in, as they would have this parade, if you will, in showing their victory, they spoiled whoever this other people group was and it was seen that they were left in a place of being disarmed or neutralized. Why? Because they were in shackles behind the chariots. And here the word of God says that Christ, when he went to the cross of Calvary, not only what he did for us as sinners, but what he did to Satan, that he spoiled principalities and powers. Notice he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. And so this idea of making a show of them openly and triumphing over them, again, to use the understanding and the reference to a Roman triumph, it was an open thing. And the Roman soldiers were triumphing over that people group that had been taken captive and had been conquered, if you will. And we find here that he says, making a show of them openly, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. How did he do that? You understand that Satan, and I believe all of the devils and all of the demons, when Christ was on the cross of Calvary, they thought they had him right where they wanted him. He would be defeated. He would be conquered. But up from the grave he arose. And the Bible says that he made a show of them openly. You know that his resurrection was not something that was hidden? He appeared to over 500 at one time. You can read the references throughout the Word of God how that he, the risen Savior, made himself known and he revealed himself to many people, in fact, as you would look at the book of Acts and think of Luke writing this particular book to Theophilus, he says in verse number three of Acts 1, to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion, notice this phrase, by many infallible... full proofs, the evidence of His resurrection. They did everything they could to bar that tomb. Did they not? But Jesus conquered sin, death, and the grave. We find that the Bible tells us that this truth in Colossians 2 where the Word of God says that He there in v. 15 made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it, that this is through the resurrection and we can rejoice greatly in understanding that we serve a risen Savior. We find that the enemy has been defeated. The enemy has been defeated. But it's absolutely imperative that we understand this morning that though He is a defeated foe, that He is active and He is attacking. Remember, that's what Paul was concerned with to start chapter number 2. This is what caused Paul to have this great conflict. It was because of the work of the enemy. You understand that the enemy works in a variety of ways. But as we begin to think about the fact that He's been, as we notice here in v. 15, that He's been conquered, He's been defeated, but we find that in the plan of God, He's allowed Satan to have a certain level of power that continues to exist to this day. We understand that He's the prince and power of the air. The Bible says the God of this world, little g, speaking of the devil, that He hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. We understand that He's active and He's attacking. Revelation 12 and v. 12 says this. Part of the verse. It's not the entire verse. You don't need to turn there. It says this, speaking of the devil, having great wrath because He knoweth that He hath but a short time. What does that mean? Well, the reality is that the devil knows that He has a short time because He knows what His demise is. He knows what His end is. And it's there in Revelation 20 that the Bible tells us before we begin to read about the great white throne judgment, the Bible tells us this in v. 10, and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever. That's not happened yet. I wish it has. Don't you? But it hasn't. And as we think about the truth of Revelation 12 and v. 12, that He has this great wrath because He knoweth that He hath but a short time, we're mindful of what it is that He's doing. How is it that He's active and what is it that He's doing until we reach that time of Revelation 20 in v. 10 when He will be cast in the lake of fire to be tormented day and night forever and ever? Again, I know many of us, all of us would say, I wish that happened already, but it hasn't. So what's He doing? Well, number one, He's seeking whom He may devour. The book of 1 Peter is written to believers. Turn over to 1 Peter if you will, look at chapter number five, but as you're turning to 1 Peter 5, I'm going to remind you that the book of 1 Peter is written to believers. It's written to the people of God. In fact, it's written to the people of God that are scattered because of persecution. The Bible begins in 1 Peter 1, in verse number one, where Peter says an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontius, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. He then begins to talk to them about their redemption, about their salvation. He says to them in verse number three, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. It's written to save people. You come to chapter number five in the book of 1 Peter, and Peter begins to express his concern to the elders and he's addressing them specifically to these leaders. He gives them the instruction of feeding the flock of God. But I want you to notice what he tells us in verse number eight of 1 Peter chapter number five. It's a familiar verse of Scripture to us. The Bible says, be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, notice, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour. He's active. I'm thankful for what Christ did to Satan at Calvary, but we must acknowledge as the people of God that Satan is still active today. I believe that he's probably more active than he's ever been. I believe that as we think about that truth of Revelation 12, 12, where it says that he has this great wrath because he knows that his time is short, that he hath but a short time. I believe that, no, he does not know the hour or the time of his demise, but I believe that there's an understanding and we see that he's working and he's active and it's like he's working overtime. And he's seeking whom he may devour. You understand that as we look at this verse of Scripture and understand the illustration by which Peter would use, he uses the analogy of a roaring lion. A roaring lion. If you ever watch and have the opportunity to see maybe a video recording of a lion hunting and how they devour their prey. We find here that Satan seeks to devour. I'm so thankful that Satan could never cause us to go to hell. If you've been saved, if you've been born again, he can't take that. We have an inheritance. He started it in chapter one that's reserved in heaven for us. But we understand that he's active. And we understand not only as we begin to think about how he's active and what he's doing, we'd understand that he is the accuser of the brethren. We looked at Revelation 12, 12, I quote a part of it to you, but in verse number 10, the Bible tells us that he is the accuser of the brethren. And he is. Maybe you have experienced times in which the accuser of the brethren has knocked on your door. Maybe there are times in which you have experienced in which the one who seeks to devour the enemy has knocked upon your door that that temptation comes in your life. As we begin to think about the truth that Paul is giving to the believers in Colossae, how we ought to rejoice greatly to understand what it is that Christ did for sinners and what he did to Satan. But we must be mindful that though he spoiled them and he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it, we understand that Satan is still active today. He is a defeated foe. It's amazing how a defeated foe can get a foothold that turns into a stronghold. We see it in the Word of God. We find as the people of God, as we try to take the truth of Colossians chapter number two and understand and rejoice in what Christ did for us and also have an understanding that though Satan has been defeated at the cross of Calvary and though Satan has been rendered in this sense of the word spoiled, that there is this disarming or this neutralizing, we know that we cannot, we cannot engage him in battle in our flesh. Can't. And we understand that as the people of God, that we still have the flesh. How many of you are keenly aware of the fact that you have a flesh? And that your flesh still has some level of desires? Right? Paul talks about in the book of Ephesians how that the flesh, excuse me, the book of Galatians, that the flesh is at enmity with the Spirit. Right? The flesh is at enmity. There's a battle that goes on. And so we understand this whole spiritual aspect of what's going on and we begin to think about as Bible believing Christians as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ and we can rejoice in some great promises of God's word for when we engage with and we have that enemy that is the accuser, the brethren that's attacking and seeking to devour that there are times in which we'll sin. Have you ever sinned since you've been saved? You laugh, why? Because we all have. Some of you sinned this morning, amen? I mean, in the parking lot maybe. I'm so thankful for the promises of God's word with regard to forgiveness. Take your Bibles under 1 John, if you will. I think about the biblical Christianity, we think about biblical Christianity and there are so many pillars of biblical Christianity. We speak about Baptist distinctives and we talk about several of those and what it is, why are you a Baptist? And you can answer those questions and understand that first answer to that question would be that the word of God is the sole authority for our faith and practice. And you can look at all the Baptist distinctives and kind of give you an idea. as to what it is that a Baptist would believe and stand for. But then we look at biblical Christianity maybe a little bit broader from those Baptist distinctions and say, what are some pillars of biblical Christianity? And there are a lot of them. But I would submit to you this morning that two of those are forgiveness and restoration. And for that, I am thankful. Notice what John says here in 1 John chapter 1. Again, we would understand even as we made reference in the book of 1 Peter that John is writing to believers the same way that Peter was writing to believers. And as he's writing to these believers in the book of 1 John, he says to them in verse number 8, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves. And the truth is not in us. But notice this great promise in verse number 9. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us. I know that we're so thankful for the promise of 1 John 1.9. Mr. Don often will say 1 John 1.9. He's speaking of this promise that God offers. Listen, remember the Old Testament reveals to us that God is plenteous in mercy. That He is ready to pardon. That He is ready to forgive. We read into chapter number 2 here of 1 John, and the Bible says, My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. But then it says this, and if any man sin, listen, it is desirous that we sin not. Amen? The closer we get to the Lord, the more we walk with God, the less we ought to be sinning. Amen? The desire is that we'd sin not, but understand, contrary to what some people taught hundreds of years ago, you're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection. It's just not going to happen until we get to glory. Amen? When this mortal shall put on immortality, when this corruption shall put on incorruption, then, and only then, will I no longer have a flesh that will cause me to sin. The enemy, right? The way in which he comes. And so, I guess if you want to call it charge from John, it is to sin not, but then he says this, see, I'm thankful for every word of God. I'm thankful for the entirety of the Word of God, because he says that you sin not, but knowing and understanding, even as we've read in chapter number one, that we are sinners and we are going to sin. He says, and if any man sin, all of us, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Aren't you thankful that you have an advocate? Because you have an accuser of the brethren. You have an accuser. But you have an advocate. You have an advocate. And I'm thankful that when the advocate stands up on our behalf, that he can say something like this, I paid for that. I paid for that. Amen? And if we confess our sins, He forgives us. He says that He removes them as far as the east from the west. That they're buried in the deepest sea. Amen? We believe the Word of God. And see, as we look at the whole, I'm thankful for the book of Colossians. Trust me, as we're studying through it, I'm encouraged and I'm strengthened and I'm helped. I'm so thankful for what Christ did for sinners at Calvary. As Paul would share with these believers, let me help you understand that you are complete in Christ. Let me help you understand that these false teachers are coming and saying that you need something more than Christ. They wouldn't say you don't need Christ, but you need something more in addition to to reach higher planes and so on and so forth. But Paul says, listen, Christ is all we need. You're complete in Christ. Here's what He accomplished at Calvary for sinners. And here's what He did to Satan at Calvary. But as we have the whole of the Bible, and we understand that Satan was defeated foe, that God has allowed him to have some level of reign in this particular era. We may not like it, but we better learn the truth of it. And he's the accuser of the brethren and he's seeking whom he may devour. But as the accuser of the brethren and as the one that's seeking whom he may devour, I'm thankful that if we sin or when we sin, that we have an advocate. An advocate with the Father. This morning, I hope that we can rejoice greatly in understanding what Paul explains to the believers in Colossae with regard to what Christ accomplished at the cross of Calvary. If you're here this morning and you've never trusted Christ as your Savior, maybe when we were singing, are you washed in the blood? You're not able to answer with confidence that you've been saved, that you've been born again. Today is the day of salvation. Today is the day of salvation. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior and He wants to save you. But for us as the people of God, would we rejoice in what Christ accomplished? But also be mindful of the battle that still continues. It's often been said, in fact, I've mentioned it on a number of occasions. As you read through the book of Romans, you'll see it in particular, that the Lord Jesus Christ, He delivered us from the penalty of sin. What's the penalty of sin? Death. The wage of sin is death, right? And He delivered us from the penalty of sin. He's delivered us from the power of sin. Sin should no longer have dominion over you. But we've not yet been delivered from the presence of sin. And we find that this great Bible truth, this great biblical principle, this biblical principle for Christianity, is that we believe in the pillar of forgiveness and restoration. And we understand that with, as a child of God, that I have an advocate that stands on my behalf. You think about the legal terminology and the legal understanding here, that this advocate stands on my behalf. And because we understand the truth of substitutionary atonement, He took my place. He took my place. And He took your place. Nailing it to His cross. I'm so thankful for what Christ did for us at Calvary. Let's pray. Father, how we love You this morning and how we thank You for Your Word. We thank You for that which was accomplished over 2,000 years ago there at the cross of Calvary. We thank You for what You did for sinners and for what You did to Satan. And God, as we walk with You, I pray that You'd help us to walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Help us, God, to be mindful that we have an enemy that seeks to devour, that is the accuser of the brethren. And I pray that You'd help us to rejoice greatly in knowing that we have an advocate with the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray, God, that You would help us to rejoice in that truth. If there's one that's not sure of heaven, it's our prayer that today would be the day of their salvation. The Holy Spirit of God would use the Word of God to convict and convince of sin, of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come. We pray that as we have a time of invitation, that, Lord, You would work as only You can. You would move, help us, Lord, to be responsive. We pray that You'd be glorified through each decision. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano. And as she does, the altar is open. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe you just need to come and ask the Lord to help you as you walk this Christian life, knowing that we have an adversary. Maybe there's some sin that you need to come confess and get that forgiveness and understand that you have an advocate with the Father. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.",
